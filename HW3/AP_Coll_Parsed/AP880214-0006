Presidential candidates plunged Saturday 
into the final weekend of campaigning before New Hampshires 
doordie primary with Democrats staging a spirited debate and 
Republican Sen Bob Dole encountering hecklers from opposition 
camps 
Dole locked in a tight race in New Hampshire with Vice 
President Geroge Bush was campaigning at a shopping mall in 
Bedford when he found himself surrounded by chanting supporters of 
Bush and Rep Jack Kemp 
The scene quickly became a shouting contest with signwaving 
supporters from the three campaigns vying for attention The 
shouting cointinued in the parking lot after Doles motorcade 
departed 
The Democratic debaters engaged in a little shouting of their 
own with Jesse Jackson acting as peacemaker and urging his rivals 
to stick to the issues and stop playing how bruised I am 
The debate heated up quickly with Rep Richard Gephardt and Sen 
Paul Simon continuing their running dispute over Simon commercials 
that attack Gephardt Then Sen Albert Gore Jr and Gephardt had a 
runin over remarks Gephardts campaign manager made about Gore 
New Hampshire Democratic frontrunner Michael Dukakis attacked 
Gephardt for accepting money from political action committees and 
also for supporting an oil import fee 
At times it was hard to distinguished who was shouting at whom 
Whats your energy policy former frontrunner Gary Hart 
asked the Massachusetts governor 
This is a budget issue chimed in former Gov Bruce Babbitt 
of Arizona 
Can I finish my answer asked Dukakis 
The nationally televised onehour debate sponsored by the 
League of Women Voters took place at St Anselm College in 
Goffstown 
The League was sponsoring a Republican debate at the college on 
Sunday 
Meanwhile two polls showed Bush and Dole locked in a tie for 
the lead in New Hampshires Republican primary with Dukakis 
enjoying a solid advantage among Democrats 
An ABCWashington Post poll gave Bush and Dole each 29 percent 
Kemp Pat Robertson and former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont were tied 
for third with 12 percent Dukakis had 40 percent with Gephardt and 
Simon each at 16 percent 
The poll was based on interviews with 375 likely Democratic 
primary voters and 373 likely Republican primary voters over three 
days ending Friday It had a margin of error of plus or minus five 
percentage points for the Democrats and six percentage points for 
the Republican sample 
The Sunday Boston Globe said its poll of 789 New Hampshire 
voters surveyed Thursday Friday and Saturday showed 39 percent of 
the Democrats for Dukakis with 14 percent for Gephardt and 13 
percent for Simon 
Dole was favored by 32 percent of the likely Republican voters 
and Bush had 28 percent Ten percent were undecided The poll had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points 
At his first campaign stop of the day Gephardt the winner in 
Iowa last Monday warned his rivals particularly Simon that 
negative campaigning now could hurt the partys chance to win the 
presidency 
Were not going to win this if were brawling in the mud 
said Gephardt who has been the target of Simon commercials 
focusing on the Missouri congressmans votes in favor of the B1 
bomber and nuclear power 
Kemp of New York whose candidacy hinges on the support of New 
Hampshire Republican voters on Tuesday unveiled a new television 
commercial attacking Dole for not being effective enough in the 
fight to get congressional approval of aid to the Nicaraguan 
Contras 
Kemp spokesman John Buckley described Dole as relatively 
passive on the issue of Contra aid 
When the congressman was asked if his candidacy could survive a 
finish behind Robertson on Tuesday he replied Hes not going to 
beat me in New Hampshire 
Dog sled races in Laconia drew Kemp Bush and Dukakis while du 
Pont went rummaging for votes at the Bedford town dump 
Noticing campaign workers for Dole and Bush passing out 
literature at the dump which attracts 400 to 500 people on a 
Saturday du Pont said Heres a real candidate 
Dukakis at an appearance in Dover shrugged off criticism in a 
Gephardt television commercial that called him one of the biggest 
tax raisers in Massachusetts history 
Ive cut taxes five times in the last four years Dukakis 
said adding that he did not want to see the Democrats letting 
themselves disintegrate into the kind of backyard squabbling that 
Bush and Dole have been involved in 
Robertson toured shopping malls on the seacoast shaking hands 
and telling people I need some help on Tuesday 
The former evangelist told reporters Its a horserace all the 
way and I think we might see some surprises come Tuesday night 
But the momentum is on my side right now and thats the good way to 
be at this stage 
Bush appeared at a high school in Wolfeboro with Gov John H 
Sununu and Hall of Fame baseball player Ted Williams and was on the 
offensive against Dole 
I think Bob is making some statements that are pretty 
extravagant said the vice president Bob Dole says when Ronald 
Reagan wants something done he calls Bob Dole But when he wanted 
somebody to be the vice presidnt of the United States he called 
me 
In addition to his campaigning Robertson was the candidate 
featured this weekend in the televised interviews by David Frost 
part of the series called The Next President 
Asked about Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi the former television 
evangelist said I wouldnt have hesitated to kill him Hes a 
madman and he was a terrorist 
Dole picked up the endorsement of former defense secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld who dreamed of being one of the GOP candidates but 
eventually decided against entering the race 
Also appearing with Dole at Jaffrey was former Secretary of 
State Alexander M Haig Jr who dropped out of the race on Friday 
and endorsed the Kansan 
Addressing a rally at Conant High School Dole said Some 
people say Bob Dole is pretty tough You better hope Im tough 
Were talking about our future Were talking about our childrens 
future Were talking about our grandchildren 
It was clear that Doles victory in Iowa coupled with Bushs 
embarrassing thirdplace finish had blown away the big edge the 
vice president once held in New Hampshire surveys 
New Hampshire could be a last stand for Kemp and du Pont as 
well as for two Democrats former Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and 
former Sen Gary Hart of Colorado 
Kemp said he was confident hed finish ahead of Robertson in the 
primary Asked if he also had to beat Bush or Dole he replied 
No Ive got to be competitive Ive got to be up in the pack 
among the leaders And thats what our goal is 
You have to do well you have to start beating somebody 
conceded du Pont who finished fifth in Iowa and is running the 
same in New Hampshire surveys 
The new Kemp ad took swipes at both Dole and Bush on the Contra 
aid issue 
The commercial said that in the recent House vote that rejected 
President Reagans request for more money for the Contras eight 
Bush supporters were among those who voted against the money The 
ad also quoted Dole as telling the Boston Globe he wasnt 
concerned about Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega or his army 
Is that leadership 
When reporters asked how Kemp could attack Dole when the 
senator had voted for Contra aid Buckley said Sure hes voted 
in the right place But this guy has run for the last year on 
leadership Bob Dole has been relatively passive on this 
issue
