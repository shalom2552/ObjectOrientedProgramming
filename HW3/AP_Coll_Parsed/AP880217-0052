It was a ballgame a prize fight a poker game 
and the always popular footrace It was high stakes make or break 
a snowslide the shoe on the other foot popcorn in a microwave 
Amid a muddle of metaphors the networks struggled Tuesday night 
to impress viewers with the importance of the New Hampshire 
primary occasionally noting with belated cynicism that if they 
werent all there it wouldnt really mean much 
ABC anchor Peter Jennings opened his newscast Tuesday by noting 
New Hampshire cant make a candidate but it certainly can break 
one 
He was seconded by Jeff Greenfield who described the press 
attention on the nations first presidential primary as smothering 
rather than covering and suggested one of the most interesting 
aspects of the New Hampshire primary is not what we will know when 
its over but what we wont know 
Vice President George Bushs surprisingly strong comeback was 
the obvious lead On the Democratic side losers were news 
Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis won as expected so the question 
became who among the remaining candidates would stay the course 
For alsorans as well as frontrunners the task Tuesday night 
was putting on the best face for the national television audience 
Former Colorado Sen Gary Hart who finished out of the money told 
CNNs Mary Alice Williams he had managed to find his finish in the 
low onedigits disappointing but not discouraging 
Later on NBC Illinois Sen Paul Simon noted more candidly of 
his thirdplace finish This isnt helping 
Dole whose alleged meanspiritedness became an issue in the 
campaign didnt help his image In Greenfields piece on ABC he 
was heard during a campaign stop muttering to an interloping Bush 
supporter Go back to your cave 
NBCs Tom Brokaw orchestrated the liveliest moment in the 
nights coverage with Bush in the studio and Dole live on a 
monitor Brokaw asked Bush what he would like to say to his 
opponent 
I wish him well and will see him in the South said a 
cheerful Bush But when Brokaw asked Dole the same question he 
snapped Stop lying about my record 
There were milder rematches between anchors and politicians 
Rather interviewed Bush live for the first time since their 
interviewturneddebate during the CBS Evening News last month 
that sparked a flurry of complaints about Rathers aggressive 
questioning This time Rather sat quietly and let Bush talk then 
happily characterized the New Hampshire win as a joy and a 
jubilation for Bush 
Brokaw again introduced Pat Robertson as a former television 
evangelist a term that last week in Iowa prompted Robertson to 
suggest Brokaw was engaging in religious bigotry Robertson let 
it slide Tuesday night 
CNN devoted most prime time to politics but among the other 
three networks NBC was the only one to preempt primetime 
programming for election coverage with an hourlong special at 10 
pm EST 
ABC wrapped up at midnight in lieu of airing Nightline All 
the networks were set up in Manchester NH and the candidates 
made the rounds all night but ABC bagged the idea of candidate 
interviews due to the late hour of its special Its brief 
primetime coverage no doubt had the biggest audience however 
since it interrupted Olympics coverage 
CBS wrapped up at 1130 after devoting its regular weekly news 
documentary 48 Hours to the campaign trail 
In a week when the shows format 48 hours of intense coverage 
should have been eminently adaptable to a breaking news story 
48 Hours fell flat except for Lesley Stahls poignant coverage 
of highclass loser Bruce Babbitt After his poor Iowa showing 
cameras caught two campaign workers embracing tearfully 
We were the best one said No one will ever know it 
added the other 
The rest of the hour was about as exciting as watching political 
placards flapping in the breeze 
Other moments worth noting 
Most meaningful background report Stahls examination of the 
money issue and how it will determine who stays in the race 
Most entertaining graphic Those little straw hats on NBC 
Most finely crafted simile Rathers things are popping like 
the popcorn in one of those microwaves 
Most eloquent comment Jennings noting Gary Hart who said 
let the people decide The people decided He came in absolutely 
last 
Most timely promo NBCs commercial for its 10 pm special at 
11 pm
