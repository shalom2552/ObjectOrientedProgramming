Republicans view an emerging Democratic 
package of purely humanitarian aid for Nicaraguas Contra rebels as 
pretty soft stuff and will seek to bring their own aid package 
up for a vote next week the House GOP leader said Thursday 
I would certainly hope that whatever the speaker brings 
up that wed be given an opportunity as a minority party to offer 
a substitute for whatever they propose Rep Robert Michel 
RIll told reporters 
He said the preliminary indications are such that its going 
to be pretty soft stuff that wont get the job done And if its 
just that of course we would want to make one more attempt at 
doing something more significant 
President Reagan lost his bid in a House vote Feb 4 for a 362 
million aid package that included some 36 million for weapons and 
ammunition along with additional millions for military logistical 
support 
Democrats prevailed on that vote 219211 after the partys 
leadership promised wavering members that there would be a later 
opportunity to approve a package of Contra aid that included only 
food clothing medicine and shelter 
A group of interested Democrats together with one or two 
Republicans who voted against the presidents proposal have been 
meeting daily for the past week to draft such an alternative 
House Speaker Jim Wright DTexas said Wednesday that the 
package would continue aid at current rates about 18 million a 
month for the aid itself and an undetermined additional amount for 
transportation of the goods but that many other difficult issues 
remained unresolved 
Wright has invited White House officials and the Republican 
leadership to participate but they have elected to stay aloof from 
the package 
Michel alluded to the difficulties Democrats were having in 
drawing up an aid package that could win majority support and 
noted that the issue of how the goods are to be transported remains 
unresolved The CIA is using airdrops to get materiel to the 
rebels but that authority expires Feb 29 
Many Democrats want delivery authority shifted to some neutral 
international body such as the Red Cross or Organization of 
American States but such groups would be unlikely to agree to make 
deliveries so long as hostilities continue 
Ceasefire talks between the rebels and the leftist Sandinista 
government of Nicaragua are continuing in Costa Rica 
My feeling is it has to be done continue to be done through 
the agency its the only meaningful way of getting it there 
Michel said referring to the CIA 
There are some undelivered military supplies from the original 
appropriation which ended last year that have not yet been 
delivered he said I would like to see that there still be 
that capability for the delivery of the balance of that material
