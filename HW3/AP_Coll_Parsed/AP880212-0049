hotel in 1963 it had fallen prey to termites and neglect 
There was no electricity in many places no water above the 
second floor said Lawrence the hotels sixth owner It was 
infested with termites and rats This was a property that had 
everything but the bulldozer gutting it down

stateliness restored It has new foundations plumbing heating 
electricity and an 8 million fire protection system

Today about half of the hotels guests are corporate 
executives With 1400 employees serving 700 suites guests pay a 
premium for service Lawrence said The hotels average rate is 
200 a day 
It all began as a dream of railroad tycoon Elisha Babcock and 
piano magnate HL Story who envisioned while hunting on the 
barren peninsula a resort that would be the talk of the Western 
world 
It was designed by three brothers former railroad architects 
James Merritt and Watson Reid and built largely by unskilled 
Chinese laborers It became the largest structure outside of New 
York City to be electrically lighted powered by the first power 
plant in California
