shoot his former wife and her boyfriend was in jail Tuesday 
charged in a mistaken identity shooting spree that left an elderly 
woman dead at the wrong address police said 
John Edward Boggs 55 of Vermilion was arrested Monday and 
transferrerd Tuesday from Erie County to Lorain County where he 
was jailed awaiting a court appearance in county Common Pleas 
Court Boggs attorney Charles F Adams said no date for the 
court appearance had been set 
A 70yearold woman was killed and two others were wounded in 
the shooting last Thursday in Zephyrhills a town in central 
Florida Boggs faces one count of firstdegree murder and two 
counts of attempted murder according to Pasco County Fla 
Sheriff Jim Gillum 
Boggs was a crane operator at USX Corps Lorain Works until he 
retired in 1985 according to USX spokesman Thomas Ferrall in 
Pittsburgh He and his wife Geraldine were granted a divorce on 
Jan 11 
Authorities said Boggs intended victims apparently were his 
exwife and Gerald Rush who live in the same town but in a 
different mobile home park six miles from the shooting scene 
Pasco County Sheriff Jim Gillum said Boggs visited the Colony 
Hills Mobile Home Park in Zephyrhills looking for a resident with 
the last name of Rush A park secretary showed him where Harold 
Rush lived 
Boggs broke into Harold Rushs mobile home with a shotgun and 
handgun and started shooting Gillum said A single blast killed 
Nigel Maeras 70 and injured her daughter Betsy Ritchie 50 and 
Harold Rush 69 
Apparently he believed he was shooting Mr Gerald Rush and 
his former wife On his return to Ohio its very possible he 
thought he killed them Gillum said 
Vermilion police chief Roland Fleming said Boggs was arrested 
Monday after Florida authorities issued a warrant for his arrest 
Fleming said Boggs was stopped in his car and did not resist 
It was a one in a million case of mistaken identity Gillum 
said 
Harold Rush and Ms Ritchie were in stable condition Tuesday at 
East Pasco Medical Center The two Rushes are not related 
At first police were stumped by the shooting But then a 
detective recalled Geraldine Boggs calling days earlier and saying 
her former spouse was en route to Florida to kill her and her 
boyfriend Gillum said 
Detective Linda Johnson then questioned a secretary at the 
Colony park and learned a man had been looking for the Rush 
residence
