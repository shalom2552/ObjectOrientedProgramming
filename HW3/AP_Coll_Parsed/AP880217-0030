Attorney General Edwin Meese III will decide 
as promptly as he can whether two Detroit newspapers should be 
allowed to merge their business and production operations 
On Tuesday the last day for filing briefs before the case went 
to Meese attorneys for The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press 
said denial of the joint operating agreement application would 
result in the closure of the 156yearold Free Press and the loss 
of 2200 newspaper jobs 
Under a joint operating agreement the newspapers would split 
profits and combine their advertising circulation and production 
departments but would retain separate news and editorial 
departments 
The newspapers said a joint operating agreement would result in 
the elimination of 600 to 1000 jobs 
The application was filed under the Newspaper Preservation Act 
designed to prop up newspapers in danger of financial failure as a 
means of preserving competing editorial voices in cities 
The issue is decided in a quasijudicial process with the 
Justice Departments antitrust division presenting arguments 
against the proposed agreement and the newspapers arguing for it 
The attorney general acts as an impartial judge in making the final 
ruling on the application 
Mark Sheehan Justice Department spokesman said Meese will 
act as promptly as he can but that he probably will want his 
staff to review and analyze the case first 
The News is owned by Gannett Co and the Free Press is owned by 
KnightRidder Inc The two papers have long been locked in a battle 
for newspaper dominance in Detroit 
The News which is the larger newspaper has lost 75 million 
since 1979 and the Free Press has lost 100 million according to 
KnightRidder 
Final briefs by the newspapers and the antitrust division 
included discussion of the weight Meese should give to a decision 
in January by directors of KnightRidder to close the Free Press if 
a JOA is disapproved 
The antitrust division contends that when the newspapers 
announced their application for the joint operating agreement in 
1986 KnightRidder was willing to continue subsidizing the Free 
Press 
Whether a newspaper is failing within the meaning of the 
Newspaper Preservation Act should properly be determined as of 
the time it enters into a JOA agreement not on the basis of 
decisions made in the face of subsequent failure to win approval 
under the statute the division said 
The newspapers countered that the boards announcement made it 
clear that the choice now is between a JOA and the certain 
closure of the Free Press 
Local 22 of the Newspaper Guild which represents editorial 
employees voted 34984 Monday night to continue opposition to the 
JOA 
But a brief filed by the newspapers included statements by five 
other unions representing News and Free Press employees 
withdrawing opposition to the proposed agreement 
Those unions said the JOA is the only way to assure the 
survival of the Free Press and the preservation of two independent 
editorial voices in Detroit
