Northern Ireland police Wednesday announced a 
disciplinary inquiry against officers involved in the killing of 
six unarmed men in the province in three incidents in late 1982 
The investigation headed by Charles Kelly chief constable of 
the Staffordshire force will delve into a controversy that has 
resurfaced this year to embarrass the British government and 
seriously damage its relations with Ireland 
The Royal Ulster Constabulary Northern Irelands police force 
said the inquiry was ordered by its chief constable Sir John 
Hermon It did not say how many officers would be investigated or 
what penalties they might face 
The announcement came three weeks after the government disclosed 
that evidence had emerged of perjury and subversion of justice in 
an alleged coverup of the circumstances of the shootings 
On Jan 25 the government said it would not prosecute the 
police officers involved provoking angry reactions from Dublin as 
well as British opposition politicians 
The decision to take disciplinary action was seen as an attempt 
to placate the Irish government while the opposition Labor Party 
said it confirmed longstanding allegations of police misconduct in 
Northern Ireland 
This is perhaps one of the most serious and grave statements 
we have heard about the British security forces in Northern 
Ireland said Kevin McNamara Labors spokesman on Northern 
Ireland in a House of Commons debate 
Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King told Parliament 
Undoubtedly serious mistakes were made which have damaged the 
reputation of the RUC 
He said the issues go to the heart of the problems faced by a 
police force using the normal processes of law while fighting a 
ruthless and vicious terrorist enemy 
The shootings were investigated for two years by John Stalker 
then assistant chief constable of Manchester 
He found that five deaths occurred when police in separate 
incidents fired on moving cars The occupants were unarmed but 
were acknowledged by their organizations as guerrillas The sixth 
victim was a teenager who stumbled on a guerrilla explosives 
hideout that was under police surveillance and was shot in 
stillunexplained circumstances 
Stalker this month published a book claiming he was dumped from 
the inquiry because his findings threatened to implicate senior RUC 
officers in murder 
King said the inquiry would determine whether to bring 
disciplinary action against officers up to the rank of chief 
superintendent The Northern Ireland Police Authority a 
policecivilian watchdog body would have to decide whether more 
senior officers should be disciplined he said 
King also outlined structural changes in the RUC prompted by the 
lessons of the 1982 shootings 
In Dublin in a parliamentary debate on the worsening state of 
AngloIrish relations Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said 
recent controversies concerning Northern Ireland had aroused 
strong feelings of Irish public opinion 
Besides the 1982 shootings he cited 
The British appeals courts refusal Jan 28 to grant a retrial 
to six Irishmen serving life sentences for twin bomb attacks that 
killed 21 people in 1974 The six claim they are innocent and were 
convicted on faulty forensic evidence and confessions they say were 
beaten out of them 
Britains refusal to fulfill conditions set down by Ireland 
for the extradition of Irish terrorist suspects to British police 
under a new extradition treaty that took effect Dec 1 
The British governments announcement Tuesday that it will 
make its controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act a permanent law 
rather than requiring annual parliamentary renewal 
The 13yearold act empowers police to hold terrorism suspects 
for up to seven days without charging them or giving them access to 
a lawyer
