The uncle of a Marine lieutenant colonel 
kidnapped in Beirut on Wednesday said he expects his nephew will 
act like an officer and a gentleman 
He loves his country He is capable of standing up as well as 
an ordinary man will under the circumstances I dont think 
they could bring enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his 
country in any way I think he would die first said Delbert 
Eagle uncle of Lt Col William R Higgins 
Higgins father William F Higgins was extremely ill in a 
Louisville hospital Wednesday His sister Mary Fisher was with 
the elder Higgins and asked not to be disturbed The Pentagon said 
Higgins had come home this fall on emergency leave to visit his 
father 
The Pentagon said Higgins 43 was on temporary detail serving 
as the chief of the UN Truce Supervision Organizations Lebanon 
Observer Group 
UN sources said Higgins was kidnapped in the late afternoon on 
the coastal highway between Lebanons southernmost port of Tyre and 
the border town of Naqoura site of the UN forces headquarters 
Higgins family lived in Garrard County in central Kentucky when 
he was born and later moved to Louisville where he was graduated 
from Southern High School in 1963 Much of his leisure time was 
spent with his uncle 
He fished a lot with me He drove me from time to time He 
drove me to California once to Florida down south a couple of 
times We were pretty close together as he grew up said Eagle 
86 a former circuit court judge 
Yes he wanted to be in the military service He always talked 
about wanting to go to the military service He wanted to go to 
West Point Eagle said 
He was appointed to West Point but elected instead to study at 
Miami University of Ohio on a Navy ROTC scholarship He was 
commissioned a 2nd lietenant when he graducated in 1967 with a 
business degree 
He later earned masters degrees in human resources management 
at Pepperdine University in California and in political science at 
Auburn in Alabama 
A high school friend said students at Southern were surprised 
when Higgins went into the Marines 
You think of the Marines as being machotype and he really 
wasnt like that But he seems to have done all right at it said 
Rudy Fischer now a lab technician at Rohm and Haas Chemical Co in 
Louisville 
He was involved in a lot of social activities played football 
and was one of the top students in the class Fischer said 
Just pretty much an average guy 
Ralph Allen an assistant principal at Southern High School was 
a math teacher there when Higgins attended and was also a neighbor 
He was a top student and very active in school He played on 
the football team He came from a good family and was well liked 
Allen said 
Eagle said Higgins was more studious than athletic but was a boy 
who liked to hunt and fish and romp in the woods 
Higgins is married to Marine Maj Robin Higgins who works at 
the Pentagon He has a 17yearold daughter by a previous marriage
