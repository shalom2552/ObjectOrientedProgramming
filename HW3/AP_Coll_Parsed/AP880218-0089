The outburst of spending for meanstested entitlement programs 
that occurred in the 1970s has been curbed Eligibility rules have 
been tightened to retarget benefits to the truly needy and 
significant progress has been made in improving the efficiency and 
effectiveness of these programs 
We have begun the process of putting other entitlement programs 
on a more rational basis This includes Medicare which was 
converted from costplus financing to a system that encourages 
competition and holds down costs 
Federal spending for domestic programs other than entitlements 
has been held essentially flat over the last five years while 
basic benefits for the poor the elderly and others in need of 
federal assistance have been maintained This is a dramatic 
improvement over the unsustainably rapid annual growth of these 
programs that prevailed before 1981 
The Social Security system has been rescued from the threat of 
insolvency 
Our defense capabilities have been strengthened Weapons 
systems have been modernized and upgraded We are recruiting and 
retaining higher caliber personnel The readiness training and 
morale of our troops have been improved significantly Because we 
are stronger enormous progress has been achieved in arms reduction 
negotiations with the Soviet Union 
Federal agencies have undertaken a major management improvement 
program called Reform 88 This program has two main 
objectives to operate federal agencies in a more businesslike 
manner and to reduce waste fraud and abuse in government 
programs 
Some functions of the federal government such as financing 
waste treatment plants are being transferred back to state and 
local governments In other instances such as water projects 
state and local governments are bearing a larger share of costs 
leading to more rational decisionmaking in these areas 
Finally we have made real progress in privatizing federal 
activities that are more appropriate for the private sector than 
government Notable examples include the sale of Conrail the 
longterm lease of National and Dulles Airports and the auction of 
billions of dollars in loan portfolios 
Related to this shift away from the federal budget are our 
achievements on cost sharing and user fees shifting the cost of 
projects and programs where appropriate to nonfederal sources 
While we have reason to be proud of this record of achievement 
we must be vigilant in addressing threats to continued prosperity 
One major threat is the federal deficit

If the deficit is not curbed by limiting the appetite of 
government we put in jeopardy what we have worked so hard to 
achieve 
Larger deficits brought on by excessive spending could 
precipitate rising inflation interest rates and unemployment 
We cannot permit this to happen and we will not
