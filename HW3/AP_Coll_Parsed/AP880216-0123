Former highway patrolman Craig Peyers penchant 
for long talks with young women drivers ended in murder on the 
night he met Cara Knott a prosecutor said in final arguments 
Tuesday 
Deputy District Attorney Joe Van Orshoven told a jury that 
Peyers practice of pulling women over on the Mercy Road exit of 
Interstate 15 then talking to them for an hour or more led to the 
womans death 
Knott was strangled with a rope the prosecution contended 
We know that Craig Allen Peyer had a custom a habit a 
practice Van Orshoven said of the traffic stops 
On Dec 27 1986 when Knott died something went wrong She 
wasnt like these other youngsters Orshoven said 
She became anxious and scratched her assailants face Orshoven 
said 
The prosecutor showed the jury a family photo of the vivacious 
Knott and then three coroners photos of the dead woman with 
strangulation marks on her neck and bruises on her face 
The prosecutions witnesses included 22 women who said they had 
been pulled over by Peyer at the Mercy Road exit and that he had 
kept them talking for an hour or more about highway safety and 
other innocuous topics None claimed that Peyer made advances or 
attempted to harm her 
In his final arguments defense attorney Robert Grimes contended 
that some of those witnesses had lied 
Peyer 37 has already been fired by the California Highway 
Patrol which concluded that he killed Knott without justification 
He is appealing his dismissal 
Knotts body was found the day after her murder below a bridge 
on a frontage road on Interstate 15 the highway Peyer was assigned 
to patrol the night of the killing Peyer a 13year CHP veteran 
was arrested 18 days later 
Testimony in the trial ended Feb 9 but closing arguments were 
postponed last week after a prosecutor broke a tooth at breakfast 
and was unable to deliver his summation 
The prosecutions case rest largely rests on blood samples 
microscopic fibers and testimony of witnesses about Peyers 
behavior during prior traffic stops and his comments to colleagues 
Fiber experts testified that microscopic fibers found on Peyer 
and Knott matched threads found in each others clothing A rope 
found in Peyers patrol car also was said to match marks on the 
victims neck 
There was testimony that blood found on the victim matched 
Peyers type but the jury was instructed to disregard that 
Witnesses testified that Peyer had three scratches on his face 
the night of the murder He told other officers he fell while 
pumping gas and hurt himself on a chainlink fence 
A CHP officer testified that Peyer once pointed out the Mercy 
Road offramp and noted that it would be a good place to dump a body 
Peyer did not take the stand but defense witnesses have 
attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses and praised the 
veteran officers professional performance
