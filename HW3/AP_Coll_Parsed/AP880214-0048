The eldest of three hemophiliac brothers 
banned from attending elementary schools in a Florida county 
because they carry the AIDS virus has now developed AIDSrelated 
complex court records show 
Ricky Ray 11 has begun to show some symptoms of the disease 
but he does not have a severe or lifethreatening illness stemming 
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome his doctor said 
Rickys ARC is stable and he is showing no signs of 
progression said Dr Jerry Barbosa a specialist in pediatric 
hematology and oncology at All Childrens Hospital in St 
Petersburg He should be able to continue performing daily 
activities 
He never posed a threat of spreading the AIDS virus in the 
past and he doesnt pose a threat to anyone in the present said 
Barbosa 
Ricky is taking the antiAIDS drug AZT and Barbosa said the boy 
is full of energy His lymph nodes are no longer swollen 
Rickys two brothers 10yearold Robert and 8yearold Randy 
remain in good health Barbosa said 
Gail Lloyd a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta said a diagnosis of ARC does not automatically 
mean a patient will develop AIDS a fatal disease that destroys the 
bodys immune system and leaves victims susceptible to infections 
and cancer 
ARC is a condition caused by the AIDS virus and has a specific 
set of symptoms Barbosa said Those symptoms are often less severe 
than the symptoms of AIDS 
The AIDS virus is spread most often through sexual contact 
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from pregnant women to their offspring Doctors 
believe the Ray brothers were injected with tainted plasmabased 
medication they received to clot their blood 
School officials in Sarasota County where the boys attend 
school said Friday they expected some mild reaction from parents 
once the news of Rickys condition spreads 
Every time there is a story about the Rays or AIDS in general 
there is some response from parents said Lee Coose principal of 
Gocio Elementary School where the Ray boys attend But that 
reaction has always been minor 
The boys medical records are on public file as part of a 
lawsuit filed against the DeSoto County School Board by their 
parents Louise and Clifford Ray Barbosa filed the results of the 
Ray boys Feb 2 physical examinations in federal court Friday 
The Ray brothers were banned from regular classes in DeSoto 
County in August 1986 after they tested positive for AIDS 
antibodies A federal judged ordered their return to the classroom 
On the fifth day they returned a fire destroyed their home 
Authorities ruled the fire was deliberately set but no arrests 
were made 
The Rays moved to Sarasota with the boys and their 6yearold 
sister Candy who is not infected
