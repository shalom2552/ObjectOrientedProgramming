The SpokesmanReview Spokane Wash on Kurt Waldheim 
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim hopes to wipe away the past and 
trust that the world will forgive and forget his part in the dark 
history of World War II Germany 
His reasoning is threadbare that everyone who served in the war 
knew what was happening the deportations mass murders torture 
that he merely followed rather than gave orders 
To deduce that knowledge constitutes some kind of crime is 
simply not correct Waldheim claims 
And he is right But while not a crime that knowledge coupled 
with his failure to act against those atrocities is a moral outrage 
After a fivemonth investigation an international panel of six 
historians decided to put aside a conclusion on Waldheims moral 
responsibility for war crimes he had knowledge of as a lieutenant 
in the German army from 1942 to 1945 instead the historians let 
the facts speak for themselves with the world and history to pass 
judgment 
The facts speak loudly but Waldheims lies cry out If his past 
is not something of which he is ashamed and afraid why is he 
weaving such a web of deceit 
If Waldheim has his way the chapter on his involvement in World 
War II atrocities is closed now He says he will not step down as 
Austrias president and he shouldnt have to 
Austria ought to pull the rug out from under him

heart of the Corn Belt and a state heavily damaged by the farm 
recession and advocate greater use of ethanol

all other graingrowing regions have a stake in the answer because 
of the wisdom of finding uses for grain now grown in excess

Hampshire Super Tuesday the nominating conventions next falls

Lewiston Maine Daily Sun on privatization of the Postal 
Service 
The push is on for privatizing the US Postal Service Every 
time the Postal Service requests a hike in the price of stamps 
privatization proponents crawl out of the woodwork with renewed 
vigor 
Sure the current operation has its drawbacks and the service is 
slow and unreliable at times The post office is a traditional 
favorite whipping boy for people carrying a grudge 
Despite several well publicized success stories of the public 
sector saving money there are obvious limitations to privatization 
and the contracting out of public services 
Some examples of gross abuse have occurred with defense 
contractors construction projects and in the health care industry 
as well 
Moreover removing essential services such as the mail delivery 
from the public sector could decrease accountability 
With an annual budget of more than 30 billion the US Postal 
Service affects much of the nations business and is crucial to the 
economy as a whole 
Free enterprise is great when applied correctly But it is not a 
panacea to provide the answers to all siutuations

Port Arthur Texas News on USSoviet relations in the Bering 
Sea 
Its still not clear whether Soviet military personnel have been 
sneaking on to St Lawrence Island a desolate chunk of US soil 
in the Bering Sea but the possibility of these surreptitious 
visits cannot be discounted either 
St Lawrence Island is about 50 miles off the coast of mainland 
Alaska but its only 37 miles off the mainland of the Soviet Union 
It is inhabited by 650 Eskimos and recently some islanders have 
been finding Sovietmade items on the island such as beer cans 
batteries a gas mask buoys with explosive charges pieces of 
Soviet uniforms etc 
Island residents also report seeing mysterious strangers some 
clad in wet suits and scuba gear who run off when encountered 
The official Pentagon response is that the material is 
flotsam and jetsam washed ashore by ocean currents but that 
doesnt explain how some of it was found far inland or why it 
included items which dont float such as batteries 
The Reagan administration should send a firm note to the Soviet 
Union stating that such adventures if they are occurring should 
cease immediately
