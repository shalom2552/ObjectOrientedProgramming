The Soviet Union today exploded a nuclear device 
underground the official Tass news agency reported indicating the 
device may have had a yield seven times greater than that of the 
atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima 
Tass said the nuclear test was staged at 605 am Moscow time 
1005 pm EST Friday with a view to upgrading military 
technology It gave no further details 
The test at the main Soviet test range of Semipalatinsk in the 
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan was the second Soviet nuclear 
test explosion this year A device was detonated at Semipalatinsk 
on Feb 6 
Tass said the latest nuclear explosion had a yield of between 20 
and 150 kilotons 
The US atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima Japan on Aug 6 1945 
had a yield of 20 kilotons or the equivalent of 20000 tons of TNT 
The superpowers are holding negotiations in Geneva aimed at 
developing a method of verifying the yields of nuclear tests and 
working out a possible test ban 
In January a delegation of American researchers and officials 
visited the Semipalatinsk range about 2000 miles southeast of 
Moscow to gather information that may be used in verifying 
USSoviet nuclear test agreements 
In April the Americans will use their methods to measure the 
yield of a Soviet nuclear blast at Semipalatinsk At the same time 
the Soviets will use their techniques to calculate the yield of a 
US nuclear test at the American test site in Nevada
