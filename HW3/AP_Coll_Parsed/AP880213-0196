A coalition of antismoking groups next fall will 
launch a 12year campaign to teach firstgraders nationwide about 
the dangers of cigarette smoking 
The National Cancer Society the American Lung Association and 
the American Heart Association want to persuade the graduating high 
school class of 2000 estimated at more than 3 million students 
not to smoke 
Officials hope that at least a third of the firstgraders in 
school this fall will be introduced to specially tailored 
antismoking material throughout their grammar school years 
The momentum is with us said Michele Kling a spokeswoman 
for the lung association We see these children the class of 
2000 as the ambassadors of a future smokefree generation 
Previewed Thursday at a public hearing of the National Cancer 
Advisory Board in Miami the campaign is a response to US Surgeon 
General C Everett Koops challenge to make the United States 
smokefree by 2000 
The Class 2000 project also parallels the National Cancer 
Institutes goal of cutting the annual cancer death rate in half by 
2000 through increased prevention detection and screening 
The firstyear goal of the campaign is to reach students in 
27000 elementary schools 
Lobbyists for the tobacco industry which antismoking forces 
criticize for running ads seductive to teenagers were unwilling 
to predict what impact the project could have on the industry 
Although they didnt endorse the concept they stopped short of 
criticizing it 
We dont think kids ought to smoke either so from that 
perspective I dont have a problem with it said Brennan Moran 
assistant to the president of the Tobacco Institute My feelings 
about this change when were talking about adults When someone is 
an adult they have the right to make their own decision 
During the first year children will learn what No Smoking signs 
mean and how to politely ask a smoker not to smoke said Dorothy 
Marcus spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society and coordinator 
for the project
