Convicted mercy killer Roswell 
Gilbert has asked for a new trial saying his lawyer botched the 
case by worrying too much about selling book and movie rights to 
the story 
Gilberts current attorney Bradley Stark filed a 65page 
motion Friday which included a sworn statment from attorney Joseph 
Varon acknowledging he may have erred in handling the case 
It is quite possible that the economic factor of the book and 
possible movie or television rights was prominent in my thinking 
and perhaps swayed my judgment in some critical areas Varon said 
in the statement 
Gilbert now 78 was convicted of firstdegree murder in May 
1985 two months after he fired two shots into the head of his wife 
of 51 years at their seaside condominium 
The retired electronics engineer said he killed his wife Emily 
to end the misery she suffered from osteoporosis and Alzheimers 
disease The case made national headlines and was made into a 
television movie that aired last year 
Varon received 50000 for the sale of Gilberts television 
movie rights Gilbert got 5000 of that amount which he donated 
to charity 
In an attempt to capitalize on widespread publicity and sympathy 
for Gilbert Varon rushed to trial without hiring an investigator 
or interviewing witnesses in the case Stark said 
In his statement Varon said he put unrealistically great 
hopes on what he termed Gilberts caretaker defense 
Basically the defense was that Gilbert should be pardoned because 
of the stress he experienced caring for a wife with Alzheimers 
disease 
Stark argued that Varon gambled on the caretaker defense to the 
exclusion of other strategies because that gave the story the best 
chance of being bought by a movie producer 
He also said that Varon made no effort to pleabargain on his 
clients behalf because that would have scuttled any movie or book 
depiction 
By relying on the sale of Gilberts story for his fee Varon was 
put in a conflict in which he had to choose between doing what was 
best for his client or creating what was most likely to be a 
marketable story Stark contended 
Varon was vacationing outside the country and could not be 
reached for comment by the Associated Press
