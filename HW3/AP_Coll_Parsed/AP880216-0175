Lobbyists for specialinterest political 
action committees believe many members of Congress give them scant 
attention unless they make campaign contributions a group that 
advocates campaign finance reform said Tuesday 
A survey of 50 PAC directors and lobbyists found the PACs see 
themselves as victims in a campaign system that forces them to 
trade contributions for access to lawmakers who decide issues of 
importance to the unions businesses and other interest groups the 
PACs represent 
One PAC director told of seeing a little black book in which 
a congressman kept the names of contributors and referred to it 
when a lobbyist sought a hearing with him 
The individual said members of Congress have told him Well I 
like your organization but you havent given me a contribution 
The interviews with the PAC officials were conducted by the 
Center for Responsive Politics a political research organization 
that is critical of PAC influence in politics 
The group said the PAC officials agreed to talk on condition 
their names would not be used in the report Among the PACs 
represented were some of the largest such as the 5 
millionperelection American Medical Association PAC and the 
smaller PACs that give less than 50000 in total contributions to 
candidates 
The groups report said the PAC officials freely admitted they 
contributed to Congress members to ensure access Some expect not 
only a meeting but a sympathetic ear 
One was quoted as saying that A lot of people think a PAC 
gives you access Well you can get access without a PAC What I am 
saying is sympathetic access 
The PAC officials also acknowledged the frequent practice of 
giving overwhelmingly to incumbents during a campaign and then if 
the incumbent loses helping the winner to retire a debt in order 
to establish influence with the new legislator 
PACs said they felt they were manipulated by members of 
Congress who constantly apply pressure for money The PACs we 
talked to said they felt unrelenting pressure to attend 
fundraisers that they were unfairly being held responsible for 
skyrocketing campaign costs and that the public held them in low 
repute the centers report said 
When a member who has received a PACs donation votes against 
that PACs interest it doesnt sit well the report said 
In one case we gave to a member thinking that we would get 
something and it didnt work Well never give to that member 
again one PAC director was quoted as saying 
Some 4000 PACs are registered with the Federal Election 
Commission They represent a spectrum of special interests from 
environmental and foreign policy concerns to farm corporate labor 
and guncontrol interests 
Election law limits each PAC to a maximum 5000 contribution to 
any one candidate in contrast to the limit for individual 
contributions of 1000 
Congress has yet to approve any of the legislative options it 
has had under consideration for some time to restrict the role of 
PACs in elections by putting a ceiling on how much in total PAC 
money any one candidate could accept or eliminate the need for 
PACs by instituting public financing for congressional campaigns
