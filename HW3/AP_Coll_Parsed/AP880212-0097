Democratic presidential hopeful Richard 
Gephardt said Friday that rival Paul Simon should withdraw negative 
advertisements from television and radio or take off the bow tie 
because hes just another politician as long as theyre on 
Simon battling with Gephardt for second place in New 
Hampshires leadoff primary Tuesday on Thursday began airing ads 
that highlight what he called inconsistencies in Gephardts 
record as a congressman from Missouri 
After alluding to their intensifying dispute during a state 
Democratic Party dinner at which both spoke Gephardt said at an 
impromptu news conference Enough is enough on these negative 
ads 
Gephardt said the spot impugns my character and my integrity 
by saying can you trust this man 
Ive never impugned Paul Simons character Ive disagreed 
with a lot of his crazy ideas but I have never once questioned 
Paul Simons motives or his integrity or whether he could be 
trusted Gephardt said 
I asked Sen Simon to take those ads off television And if he 
doesnt he ought to take off the bow tie because hes just another 
politician as long as theyre on 
At an earlier appearance Simon said he would be running 
different ads starting this weekend but not because Gephardt asked 
him to 
After the Democrats dinner Simon said he did not believe the 
dispute with Gephardt was harmful 
As long as it doesnt get too acrimonious I think a healthy 
comparison is good Simon said 
From Washington Gephardts campaign counsel said telegrams had 
been sent to television stations in Boston Manchester and 
Portsmouth Me asking them to sell Gephardt time for response ads 
to Simon 
Bob Bauer said the stations have generally agreed to sell 
Gephardt such time for the ad which will begin running Saturday 
Bauer said he had not seen the ad 
Simons campaign has described the ads not as negative but as 
simply comparing the candidates records But Gephardt said the 
spots question his motives by suggesting his record shows hes not 
trustworthy and he added 
I dont agree with Ronald Reagans balanced budget amendment 
that Simon is for I dont agree with Ronald Reagans lineitem 
veto that hes for I dont agree with Ronald Reagans subminimum 
wage which hes for I dont agree with the Senate version of the 
GrammRudman bill which Paul Simon voted for and supported which 
would have been the fulfillment of Reaganomics 
I dont agree with his changing his position on an oil import 
fee changing his position on whether we should talk to the 
Palestine Liberation Organization changing his position on the 
balanced budget amendment 
Gephardt added Ive never questioned his motives I think 
hes trying to do what he thinks is right Thats what I try to 
do 
So if were going to get into this business of going back 
through 8000 9000 votes its fine We can go through them all 
Ill stand with every vote I made 
Simon said he would not withdraw the ads aimed at Gephardt We 
may be changing ads but were not going to do it in response to 
his request 
He said he had never claimed that there is complete 
consistency in my record or anyones record But there is a 
difference between absolute consistency which no one has and a 
pattern of inconsistency The positions that Dick Gephardt is 
taking today in the campaign are appreciably inconsistent with his 
positions in the past 
Simon sed he did vote against one balanced budget proposal 
because it had unsound limitations He said he voted against an 
oilimport fee that lacked rebates for poor people and he flatly 
denied that he changed his position on the PLO 
As he did in his initial response Thursday to Simons ads 
Gephardt acknowledged that he has changed some of his positions 
over the years 
Nobodys perfect Things change you make a vote it didnt 
turn out the way you thought he said But to say someone is 
not to be trusted or someones motives are bad because you voted a 
certain way on the B1 bomber is just ridiculous 
Gephardt and Simon have acknowledged they essentially are 
fighting to place second in New Hampshire At least for Simon a 
thirdplace finish could pose severe trouble for his campaign 
Gephardt came to Concord after watching a sleddog race in 
Laconia in the middle of a fierce storm that dumped more than a 
foot of snow on New Hampshire on Friday He had to change into dry 
clothes before the lawschool speech and he appeared before the 
standingroomonly crowd in blue jeans and a plaid shirt 
And before his speech Gephardt said I dont take this 
election for granted You know when youre No 2 and youre trying 
to be No 1 its like Avis youve got to try harder So Im 
trying harder 
Gephardt reiterated familiar themes in his speech stressing the 
need for an economic overhaul and painting himself as 
antiestablishment while calling his opponents apostles of the 
status quo
