A man fired from a defense plant for 
harassing women stalked the company for six hours fatally shooting 
seven people and wounding four others as terrified employees hid 
under desks and in offices until he surrendered authorities said 
Among the injured was a woman who spurned his attentions police 
said 
Richard Wade Farley 39 of nearby San Jose walked from the 
sprawling twostory ESL Corp building about 830 pm Tuesday with 
his hands in the air He was quickly surrounded by three officers 
and taken to the Santa Clara County Jail 
Im not crazy I know I will die as a result of this the 
chief negotiator Sunnyvale Public Safety Lt Rueben Grijalva 
quoted the gunman as saying before the surrender 
Daryl Anderson an ESL business analyst said she was in her 
secondfloor office about 230 pm when the gunman came down the 
hall firing shots She said bullets punctured her office door 
I was under my desk in the fetal position for six hours she 
said I figured there was a sniper in the building The worst 
part of all was being there all by myself in the dark All the time 
I thought he was right out there in the hall 
The bodies of two women and five men were found when police 
swept through the Silicon Valley building after the arrest said 
Commander Alex Michaelis of the Sunnyvale Department of Public 
Safety 
After the incident police said five people were wounded But 
this morning Lt Tom Moore reduced the number of injured to four 
adding he could not immediately explain the discrepancy 
Police seized a rifle a shotgun 9mm and 380caliber handguns 
and two bandoliers of ammunition after the gunman left his hiding 
place in a secondfloor room 
Grijalva said Farley told him he invaded the building to wreck 
equipment 
ESL or ElectroMagnetic Systems Laboratories a subsidiary of 
TRW Inc was established in 1964 and specializes in electronic 
warfare systems for the Navy most of them highly classified 
Products include reconnaissance systems datacommunications 
systems computer simulation and image processing It employs about 
2200 people 
Police said the gunman took no hostages but that many employees 
had to hide under desks or in locked rooms 
On the second floor the gunman met the woman who had spurned 
him 26yearold engineer Laura Black When she slammed an office 
door in his face he shot her through the door Grijalva said He 
said Farley told police he shot the others because he felt 
threatened by them 
At one point Farley began crying when talking about his mother 
the lieutenant said 
Black was wounded in the shoulder police said She was listed 
in stable condition at Stanford University Medical Center after 
surgery 
Farley had worked at ESL as a computer software technician 
before he was fired two years ago after complaints that he sexually 
harassed Black and other female employees said Jean Tuffley of 
the companys personnel department 
Farley who lived by himself in a dilapidated bungalow 
allegedly followed Black over four years and Black had tried to 
obtain a restraining order to keep him away Moore said 
It was described to me as a situation that had turned into 
harassment He had according to him given her a warning to 
return his attentions and she didnt heed the warning and he said 
this was his way of making a point said Capt Al Scott 
Near the ESL building which is about 40 miles south of San 
Francisco police found a motor home they believe was driven by the 
gunman Inside officers found ammunition full cans of gasoline 
and other explosive material said Scott 
At one point during the negotiations the gunman expressed a 
little remorse for his actions said Moore 
It was not clear how many of his victims the gunman knew 
One of those killed was identified by company officials as 
Lawrence J Kane of San Jose The rest were not identified this 
morning 
Authorities today identified the injured in addition to Black 
as Richard Townsley 44 in stable condition with a gunshot wound 
to the chest Greg Scott 39 in good condition with gunshot wounds 
to the forehead and body and Pattie Marcotte 41 was in surgery 
this morning to repair a broken elbow suffered as she fled
