An ailing 81yearold woman tried to shoot 
her retarded son to death because she was afraid to leave him at 
the mercy of strangers her attorney said Thursday 
Geraldine Sagel was sentenced Wednesday to 30 months probation 
at a nursing home by Circuit Judge William D Block who said 
Sometimes a mothers love puts people in strange situations 
The aggravated battery charge carried a maximum penalty of five 
years in prison and a fine of 10000 
It was an act of love and compassion for her son Being the 
only one who had ever ever cared for him she felt it her 
responsibility to make sure he was at peace before she died 
Assistant Public Defender Laureen Casey said Thursday 
She had indicated that she wanted to take his life and then 
would take her own said Ms Casey adding her client suffers 
from poor eyesight emphysema loss of hearing and is losing her 
memory 
Ms Sagel of Ingleside admitted shooting her 51yearold son 
Jack Butch Sagel who suffers from dwarfism as well as 
developmental disabilities 
I didnt want to leave him behind she told the court from 
her wheelchair before sentencing 
I was going blind my health was failing every day He would 
be on the mercy of the world I didnt want that your honor I 
love him too much for that she said 
Block said Ms Sagel could have supervised visits with her son 
whom she had been allowed to see only once since her arrest in 
early October 
Ms Sagel is to spend her probationary period at nearby 
Hillcrest Retirement Village where she has been since her arrest 
She was not taking telephone calls Thursday said a staff member at 
Hillcrest who refused to give her name 
Jack Sagel will remain at the Waukegan Development Center where 
he has been since early October Center officials would not discuss 
his case said Belinda Schmidtbauer who answered the telephone 
there 
Ms Sagel fired the 22 caliber pistol on Sept 30 intending to 
shoot her son in the heart but the bullet pierced his shoulder and 
then the gun jammed Lake County Chief Deputy States Attorney 
Michael Waller said Thursday 
I dont think society can condone what she did he said 
But you can empathize with her feelings I dont have any qualms 
about the outcome 
The shooting was reported a few days later by a neighbor who 
recognized the bullet wound after Sagel complained that his 
shoulder hurt Waller said 
Police and prosecutors were unable to question the victim 
because of his disabilities he said 
This case was more of a human tragedy than most criminal 
cases In a lot of cases you view the defendent as a bad guy you 
cant really say she was a bad guy Waller said 
Sagel who has the mental capabilities of a young child did 
small tasks for his mother like going to the store or getting the 
paper Ms Casey said He cannot read or write 
Ms Sagel shot her son because she feared he would be at the 
mercy of strangers and be taken for granted and even abused Ms 
Casey said 
She described the Sagels relationship as the most intense 
level of the motherson relationship Ive ever seen 
When I talk to her about seeing him she really lights up She 
always says Tell him I love him Just like a mother
