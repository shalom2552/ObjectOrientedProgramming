President Reagan this week will make one last 
try at rearranging the national agenda as he sends Congress a 11 
trillion budget for fiscal year 1989 But it will be just a ghost 
of budgets past 
With neither side spoiling for an electionyear budget brawl 
the new Reagan spending plan appears more designed to shun 
confrontation with Congress than to stake out new ground 
To be sure the budget submitted next Thursday will sound 
encores for familiar Reagan tunes selling off Amtrak abolishing 
the Interstate Commerce Commission privatizing regional power 
authorities 
But it is also laden with politically appealing offerings a 1 
billionplus program for AIDS research modernization of the 
nations air control system a speedup of the environmental 
Superfund program and more funds for orbiting a manned space 
station 
The biggest White House concession this year has already been 
made the preChristmas agreement with Congress to let defense 
spending authority rise by only 2 percent Since thats less than 
last years 44 percent rate of inflation such an increase is 
tantamount to a defense spending cut the first ever during the 
Reagan years 
Reagans earlier spending plans which envisioned the massacre 
of dozens of federal agencies and programs may have been more 
ambitious than the new one but never were very successful Not a 
single agency Reagan targeted for extinction has ever been 
abolished 
This will be Reagans final fullfledged budget He will submit 
one next January but it will quickly be refashioned by the next 
president just as Reagan redid the budget plan prepared in early 
1981 by former President Jimmy Carter 
That February a month after his inauguration Reagan sent 
Congress a stark budget calling for deep domestic spending 
reductions a huge tax cut and the promise of a balanced budget by 
1984 
While going along with the tax cuts encompassed in Reagans 
first budget Congress has never shown much enthusiasm for the 
spendingcut side of the equation 
Congress cut income taxes left domestic spending pretty much 
alone and went along with Reagans request for a defense buildup 
The annual budget deficit at 78 billion when Reagan took office 
is now hovering at near 150 billion 
Many aspects of this years budget have been predetermined by an 
agreement the White House struck with Congress late last year so 
members of Congress cant scream as they have in the past about 
Reagans defense request 
That agreement calls for defense spending authority for fiscal 
1989 which begins next Oct 1 of 2995 billion Thats up 2 
percent from the current level 
The compromise also calls for 14 billion in new revenues 
including 35 billion from the sale of government assets While 
the administration is expected to put in another 8 billion or so 
in asset sales there wont be any surprises on taxes in the budget 
And the pact also calls for shrinking the federal budget deficit 
from 148 billion of fiscal 1987 to 136 billion the target called 
for in the revised GrammRudman deficitreduction law 
The administration assuming that the economy will expand this 
year at 24 percent and at 35 percent in 1989 claims it will be 
able to meet that 136 billion through assorted domestic spending 
cuts but that it will be close 
The Congressional Budget Office using more pessimistic 
assumptions of 18 percent growth in 1988 and 26 percent in 1989 
suggested recently that the deficit could grow to 176 billion even 
under the agreement between the White House and Congress 
The deficit shrinks when the economy speeds up because more 
revenues come into the Treasury and it rises when the economy 
slows 
It may be an academic issue Under the budget law 
administration figures are used in deciding whether the 
GrammRudman requirements have been met a subtlety that may allow 
the year to pass without a knockdown budget fight 
Another reason why there may be less budget acrimony this year 
Congress will have less time to deal with the issue Not only is 
the spending plan being submitted a month later than usual but 
with party conventions comning up in the summer followed by 
elections members of Congress will have other things on their 
mind The whole process will be compressed 
We have an agreement with Congress I think the rhetoric 
will be a lot less this year says Budget Director James C 
Miller III 
Still the new Reagan budget will recycle if halfheartedly 
many past Reagan proposals including those for selling off 
government assets to the private sector 
Do not be surprised that the presidents budget will reflect 
his priorities Miller says 
Expected to be reproposed are plans to sell Amtrack rail 
passenger service Small Business Administration loans naval 
petroleum reserves regional power marketing authorities and public 
housing projects 
The new Reagan budget according to internal budget documents 
obtained by The Associated Press also will renew earlier proposals 
to eliminate mass transit grants abolish the Interstate Commerce 
Commission and the Economic Development Administration 
However spared from Reagans budget knife this time will be the 
Legal Services Corporation which the adminstration has given up 
on trying to terminate Instead deep cuts will be proposed 
Few in Congress or in the administration however consider it 
likely that Congress this year will accept proposed Reagan program 
cuts that have been repeatedly rejected in years past 
Still in the absence of a budget accord the GrammRudman law 
will take control of the situation mandating acrosstheboard 
cuts 
Actually even though the GrammRudman law calls for a deficit 
in fiscal 1989 which begins next Oct 1 of 136 billion there 
is actually a 10 billion margin of error built into the law 
That means that if Congress can cut the deficit to 146 billion 
or less lawmakers can head home for the year without further worry 
about dealing with the deficit this year 
If a recession hits during 1988 then the picture changes 
dramatically The deficit will probably mushroom back over 200 
billion where it was in 1985 and 1986 as tax revenues fall 
However the GrammRudman law has a built in safety valve in 
the case of a recession the deficit targets are waived
