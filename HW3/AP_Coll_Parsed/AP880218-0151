Anthony McLeod Kennedy was sworn in as the 
nations 104th Supreme Court justice today bringing a crucial 
tiebreaking vote to a court hampered by a vacancy the past eight 
months 
With a hand on his family Bible Kennedy promised during a brief 
ceremony to do equal right to the poor and to the rich He then 
was seated at the high court bench at the place traditionally 
reserved for the junior justice 
President Reagan who appointed Kennedy did not attend the 
courtroom ceremony but Attorney General Edwin Meese III presented 
Kennedys commission of office to the justices 
None of the three former court members still living attended the 
ceremony Justice Lewis F Powell who Kennedy succeeds and Chief 
Justice Warren E Burger were in Florida Former Justice Arthur 
Goldberg whose wife died Saturday also did not attend 
In comments before the ceremony Kennedy 51 said he had a 
running start in his new job 
Ive been working Im ready for Monday when the court ends 
its current recess Kennedy said while posing for cameras outside 
the court building prior to his swearingin 
Were just delighted to be in Washington The welcome has been 
very gracious Kennedy said 
Surrounded by his wife Mary three children and more than 30 
other relatives Kennedy said he plans to live in an apartment in 
the nations capital while he and his wife look for a permanent 
home 
Its not quite big enough for the whole family he joked 
before walking off with his relatives 
The former federal appellate judge from Sacramento Calif had 
two swearingin ceremonies today one in the Supreme Courts ornate 
courtroom and the other at the White House 
President Reagans third choice for the job Kennedy was 
confirmed by a 970 vote of the Senate 15 days ago a tranquil 
conclusion to the political storm sparked by Justice Lewis F 
Powells retirement last June 26 
The Senate rejected the presidents first choice Robert H 
Bork A second nominee Douglas H Ginsburg withdrew after 
admitting he had smoked marijuana while a law professor 
Kennedy although a conservative for his 12 years on the federal 
bench is considered more of a moderate than either Bork or 
Ginsburg 
Little is known about Kennedys specific views on abortion 
regulation affirmative action churchstate relations or the other 
politically sensitive issues on which the high court is closely 
divided 
He is the third Reagan appointee to join the court following 
Justices Sandra Day OConnor and Antonin Scalia 
Reagan also elevated William H Rehnquist to the chief justices 
post when Warren E Burger retired in 1986 
A busy schedule awaits Kennedy The court returning from a 
fourweek recess convenes in an allday conference behind closed 
doors Friday and returns to the bench Monday to begin three days of 
oral argument sessions 
One of the arguments focuses on whether private clubs may 
exclude women and racial minorities as members 
Kennedy was criticized during his Senate confirmation hearings 
for his past membership in such exclusive clubs 
The absence of a ninth justice for more than half the courts 
198788 term has resulted in some significant deadlocks 
For example the court split 44 in December when deciding 
whether a state may require some teenagers seeking abortions to 
wait 24 hours after telling their parents or a judge about their 
decision 
The justices also split 44 last month over the validity of an 
affirmative action program designed to promote more blacks and 
Hispanics in the New York City Police Department 
Such votes automatically uphold the lower courts ruling but set 
no national precedent 
The addition of Kennedy reduces the courts average age from 68 
to 66 and marks the first time in history the court has included 
three Catholics Like Kennedy Justices Scalia and William J 
Brennan are Catholic 
The court also includes three Stanford University graduates and 
four Harvard University law school grads 
Kennedy who received his undergraduate degree from Stanford and 
his law degree from Harvard joins fellow Stanford grads Rehnquist 
and OConnor The three other justices who have Harvard law degrees 
are Brennan Scalia and Harry A Blackmun
