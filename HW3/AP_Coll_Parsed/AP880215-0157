Jack Kemp calls the vice president of the 
United States an embarrassment to the Republican party Paul 
Simon asks whether Democrats can trust a man who has supported 
nuclear power and the B1 bomber 
Candidates are on the attack as the New Hampshire primary 
campaign rushes to its climax Tuesday 
For several of the dozen candidates bidding for support in the 
first presidential primary of this election year Wednesday looms 
as a day for unpacking and putting their White House dreams in 
storage 
That prospect lends an air of desperation to their tactics and 
heightens the temptation to lash out at the opposition especially 
those leading in the polls 
Kathleen Hall Jamieson a University of Texas professor said 
negative ads are appearing earlier than in past presidential 
contests 
While candidates may get some shortterm benefit from savaging 
their opponents she warned anyone who goes on the attack risks 
looking nonpresidential 
Sen Bob Dole of Kansas chipped away at Vice President George 
Bushs once formidable lead in national polls by suggesting that 
Bush was more bystander than participant in Reagan administration 
councils 
That tactic worked well in Iowa and now Bush looking more like 
an underdog has adopted it in New Hampshire and is portraying Dole 
as a Senate leader who has failed to produce the votes to sustain 
Reagan vetoes or to get Robert H Bork a seat on the Supreme Court 
Most of the attacks stay within a limit that enables the 
attacker to claim hes using comparative not negative advertising 
The most egregious example of an attack that went beyond normal 
bounds was material distributed by supporters of former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson that suggested a member of Rep Jack 
Kemps family had an abortion 
The material distributed to fundamentalist Christian voters 
asked Does he deny that his own family was involved in an 
abortion Kemp aide Mary Brunette said the allegation was a 
lie Theres absolutely no truth in it whatsoever 
Connie Snapp a Robertson spokeswoman said there was a 
possibility a campaign worker in Illinois was involved in 
distributing the antiKemp material 
During Sundays GOP debate Kemp acted outraged when Bush said 
Give peace a chance in Afghanistan 
That is a embarrassment said Kemp a Republican talking 
about give peace a chance 
On Monday Kemp elaborated on his wrath Give peace a chance 
was the rallying cry of the GephardtSimonJim Wrightwing of the 
Democratic party that cut off all aid to the freedom fighters in 
Central America the New York congressman said It was an 
embarrassment to our party to have our vice president talking like 
Jim Wright or Dick Gephardt 
Kemp also has attacked Bush and Dole with literature claiming 
both would raise taxes and cut Social Security benefits 
Jamieson said the rule is that frontrunners dont attack 
She cited an ad run by Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis as a 
classic frontrunner appeal 
Im for more trade says Dukakis the leader in all polls of 
New Hampshire Democrats 
Dukakis comes across as taking a positive position that quietly 
reminds voters that another candidate Rep Richard Gephardt of 
Missouri has a trade policy his opponents have called 
protectionist 
Gephardt came out of Iowa a winner and quickly was attacked in 
ads run by Simon Those ads cited Gephardt votes in favor of 
nuclear power and the B1 and said they were inconsistent with the 
congressmans current positions 
During the Democrats debate Saturday Gephardt complained to 
Simon 
When you say in a TV ad Who do you trust youre really 
bringing into play motives motivation and whether or not somebody 
is reliable and I think that goes over the line We can disagree on 
issues 
Jesse Jackson called the complaints about attacks campaign 
fatigue this tit for tat on how bruised I am 
But Ms Jamieson said there was a legitimate distinction 
I dont like distinction between positive and negative she 
said You have fair and unfair Anything that distorts ones own 
or an opponents record is unfair 
Once Dole became the big winner in Iowa and erased Bushs big 
lead in New Hampshire polls he became the target of attacks 
Du Pont on the brink of extinction if he doesnt score a 
breakthrough Tuesday contends Dole would raise taxes Thats about 
the worst thing a Republican can say about another Republican in 
this campaign 
To prove his point here in notoriously antitax New Hampshire 
du Pont thrust a notax pledge at Dole during Sundays debate and 
said Sign it Dole refused 
Bush also has taken up the tax cry against Dole though he left 
it to surrogates 
At a news conference Rep Don Sundquist of Tennessee a Bush 
backer described Dole as a waitin walkin talkin tax 
increase about to happen
