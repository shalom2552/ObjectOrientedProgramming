Cadet Julianna Klejnot is out of uniform 
this day at Norwich University and thats unprecedented in the 
168year history of the oldest private military college in the 
United States 
Instead of her standard green skirt and shirt she is wearing 
blue jeans and a pink cotton warmup jacket Shes one of three 
cadets on a work detail winterizing a widows home off campus 
The cadets form a Peace Corps squad that has invaded the 
military college in a pilot program designed to prepare students in 
their junior and senior years for the Peace Corps or other 
volunteer relief agencies 
The program the only one of its kind in the nation is intended 
as an alternative to campus ROTC and eventually military service 
Norwich and Peace Corps officials hope other colleges will 
follow suit and that the federal government will join with the 
schools and finance the training effort as it has done with ROTC 
military training on 400 campuses Other schools already have made 
inquiries to Norwich 
A bill is pending in Congress that would authorize 5 million a 
year for five years to enable the Peace Corps to test the program 
at other schools Norwich went ahead on its own and added the Peace 
Corps to its curriculum last September and will foot the cost 
itself 
The Peace Corps is campaigning to double its volunteers to 
10000 by 1992 and has challenged colleges to find ways to help 
Because of programs like the one in Norwich we will be able 
to reach that goal said James C Flanigan Peace Corps press 
officer in Washington 
Lewis Greenstein the Peace Corps liaison with universities 
called the Norwich pilot program a promising model for other 
colleges and the forerunner of a federally sponsored plan of 
incentives for undergraduates to consider the volunteer service 
agency Still he acknowledged the irony of a military school 
preparing people for the Peace Corps 
The impetus came from university President W Russell Todd a 
retired general with 32 years of Army service including combat duty 
in Vietnam Todd his son and his father are all graduates of 
Norwich 
The most exciting thing about it is the way people perceive 
Norwich University said Todd Theyve seen us as a bunch of 
Rambos And when weve expressed our mission in terms of the Peace 
Corps weve had a very very positive reaction from some people 
Norwich University consists of two campuses and two student 
bodies one military and one civilian The Peace Corps program has 
drawn students from each 
The Military College was founded in 1819 and the murals and 
plaques on its walls attest to its heroes from the Mexican War of 
1847 to Vietnam 
The civilian campus Vermont College eight miles away in 
Montpelier was founded in 1834 as a Methodist seminary 
It was merged into Norwich University in 1972 to allow a wider 
variety of programs and more opportunities for expansion The 
military college has an enrollment of 1300 cadets including 81 
women while the civilian college has 900 students 
Todd said he had been looking for a way to give the civilian 
part of the student body the sense of national service and when 
his wife Caroline came back from a conference on volunteerism 
last summer she told him I found what weve been looking for 
She had heard Loret Miller Ruppe director of the Peace Corps 
report on a proposal by Rev Theodore M Hesburgh president 
emeritus of the University of Notre Dame that the federal 
government devise an ROTClike Peace Corps preparation program that 
colleges could incorporate 
So rather than wait for the federal government to devise a 
program we decided wed experiment said Todd When I 
discussed it with the Peace Corps they were fascinated 
But what surprised Todd was that the Peace Corps was not nearly 
as interested as he was in putting the program on the civilian 
campus Instead they wanted it on the military campus because of 
the cadet corps physical and leadership training A compromise was 
struck to make it available to students on both campuses 
Only four students are enrolled in the first class three of 
whom had been in ROTC on the military campus and one from the 
civilian campus Todd who attributed the low enrollment to the 
programs newness last fall said the goal is 60 students two years 
from now 
The four students now enrolled are not sure whether they will go 
into the Peace Corps Students are not committed to entering once 
they graduate nor is the Peace Corps under obligation to accept 
them 
As an incentive Norwich is offering low interest loans of up to 
5000 to students in their senior year then writing them off if 
they complete two years service in the Peace Corps 
Military students at Norwich must take four years of ROTC but 
service after graduation is optional If they agree to accept a 
commission for active service after graduation they are paid 100 
a month in their last two years of college Otherwise they receive 
no monthly stipend while in school and go into the reserves upon 
graduation 
Tuition fees and room and board run 12500 a year at Norwich 
Miss Klejnot a 21yearold junior biology major from Portland 
Maine initially enrolled in Air Force ROTC because she wanted to 
see what the military was like But after 2 years she decided she 
didnt want to devote her future to a regulated life in the 
military 
The Peace Corps option was available so I decided to see what 
it was like she said 
Even though she dropped ROTC she still has to wear her uniform 
and attend three formations a day a requirement for all cadets on 
the military campus 
The Peace Corps program was designed by Richard May the 
director and university chaplain and a committee of faculty 
members who had worked with the Peace Corps and other volunteer 
agencies in Third World countries May himself had worked with 
Cambodian refugees while serving as a Navy line officer in Vietnam 
He also went to the agencies themselves to find out why their 
volunteers did or did not complete their tours The Peace Corps has 
a dropout rate of about 30 percent May said he found that many 
volunteers have little community service experience and are 
frustrated once they arrive overseas 
The Norwich program includes three hours of work in the 
community once a week classroom studies of the Third World and a 
summer internship between the junior and senior years in Jamaica 
working in the slums of Kingston 
The whole emphasis in the military is to keep from going to 
war by strength said Todd The other half of the equation is 
to make friends and make the world a better place And you wont 
have to go to war either
