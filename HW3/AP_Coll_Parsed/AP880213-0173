A ferryworkers union in Liverpool and the Isle of 
Man whose dispute sparked a national strike reached a tentative 
agreement Saturday to return to work a union spokesman said 
Roger Wilkins deputy general secretary of the National Union of 
Seamen said he expected the workers to approve the agreement with 
the Isle of Man Steam Packet Co and return to work Sunday 
The strike begun at the end of December led to a nationwide 
walkout Feb 2 that crippled ferry service at 12 ports The High 
Court ruled the strike illegal 
Union leader Sam McCluskie had ordered men who were striking in 
support of their Isle of Man colleagues to return to work but said 
other seamen striking because of their own local grievances could 
stay out 
Sealink company crews at the ports of Holyhead Liverpool and 
Fleetwood and P and O crews at Dover have remained on strike The 
agreement would not affect their walkout 
Wilkins said management which had wanted to lay off 80 of its 
161 crewmen in economy moves agreed to fire 47 
I think the members will accept it because we have got the 
best possible deal in the circumstances Wilkins said
