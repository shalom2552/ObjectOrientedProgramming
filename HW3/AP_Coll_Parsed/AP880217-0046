WhiteheadGould in an ABC television movie about the landmark court 
battle over custody of Baby M a network spokeswoman said 
The twopart movie to air at an undetermined date this spring 
will also feature John Shea Dabney Coleman and Bruce Weitz ABC 
spokeswoman Laurel Whitcomb said Tuesday 
The goal of the movie is to tell the story without adopting 
any one point of view Ms Whitcomb said in a telephone interview 
from Los Angeles 
The movie will include an update at the end because the case is 
still unfolding Ms Whitcomb said 
The latest developments involve legal proceedings to determine 
the visitation schedule for Mrs WhiteheadGould whose parental 
rights to the 22month old child were restored in a New Jersey 
Supreme Court decision earlier this month 
The states highest court overturned a lower court decision that 
upheld a 10000 contract under which Mrs WhiteheadGould was 
artificially inseminated with William Sterns sperm and bore the 
child for him and his wife Elizabeth 
In addition to stripping Mrs WhiteheadGould of her parental 
rights the lower court last March 31 awarded custody to the Sterns 
The Supreme Court maintained custody for the Sterns but voided 
the contract and ruled that Mrs WhiteheadGould was entitled to a 
hearing on visiting the child 
Attorneys for Mrs WhiteheadGould and the Sterns have agreed to 
try to reach an outofcourt settlement on visitation rights 
Mrs WhiteheadGoulds attorney Harold Cassidy said Tuesday 
that his client would be seeking more visitation time than the 
current two hours a week 
Mrs WhiteheadGould who originally called the child Sara 
has agreed to call the child Melissa and do whatever it takes to 
achieve harmony the attorney said
