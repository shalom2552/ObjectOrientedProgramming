A young polar bear believed to have 
drifted from Greenland to Iceland on an ice floe was shot and 
killed by a farmer conservationists said 
The polar bear weighing about 150 pounds and estimated to be 
one year old was seen on Sunday swimming along the coast near the 
town of Haganesvik in northern Iceland 
Residents feared that the animal would be a danger to people and 
livestock and a farmer Sigurbjoern Thorliefsson killed it with 
one shot from a distance of 2030 yards several hours after it was 
seen 
Sverrir Scheving Thorsteinsson of the Icelandic Hunting Society 
said Monday that efforts should have been made to capture the 
animal alive with a sedative gun so that it could have been 
returned to its natural habitat 
It is illegal to kill polar bears in Greenland and Norway 
Thorsteinsson told the daily newspaper Morgunbladid 
Experts believe the polar bear drifted about 250 miles to 
Iceland on pack ice from Greenland
