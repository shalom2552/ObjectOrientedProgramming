Watching a rerun of a television sitcom 
may not sound like the most romantic activity but Jeff Smith 
decided he couldnt think of a better time to pop the question 
Smith 25 bought 30 seconds of air time during a local 
stations broadcast of Its A Living to propose to Rhonda Munn 
Smith made sure Ms Munn was at home watching station WETO with 
him Sunday night when his advertisement appeared midway through the 
show The commercial showed Smith sitting in a chair listening to 
the Beach Boys song Help Me Rhonda as he proposed marriage 
The hopeful groom said Ms Munn was so bewildered by the sight 
of him on television that he had to get down on one knee and ask a 
second time for her to marry him 
It was like she couldnt quite understand what was happening 
when the ad ran he said She was laughing and confused 
It only took Ms Munn a few seconds before responding in the 
affirmative to Smiths reallife proposal he said 
Both Smith and Ms Munn 26 live in Kingsport They work as 
chemical engineers for different companies and began dating about 
18 months ago

Taking the twang out of Texas is the job of a 
diction teacher from Detroit who helps natives rid themselves of 
regional speech with an accent instead on efficient communication 
For 225 Margo Manning is offering Texans a chance to remove 
the twang from their talk 
Is Your Texas Showing the diction teacher from Detroit asks 
in a newspaper advertisement for her six weekly lessons 
Students are taught to drop the drawl and pronounce words fully 
speak in more clipped fashion and breathe from the diaphragm 
Since Texas became more of a melting pot in the last six or 
seven years people are more aware of the need to sound less 
regional said Ms Manning who operates an acting studio in Las 
Colinas 
Carol Huckin born and reared in Dallas was a recent student 
My accent was always so strong that people listened to my 
voice rather than what I was saying she said People at 
parties looked at me and smiled when I wasnt saying anything 
funny she told The Dallas Morning News
