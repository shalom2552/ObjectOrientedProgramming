The European Commission said Wednesday 
it was investigating allegations that seven Japanese photocopier 
manufacturers were dumping their products or selling them for 
less than they do in their home market 
The Commission also said it began an inquiry into whether South 
Korean companies were dumping small color television sets in the 
European market 
The Commission said the Japanese companies Canon Konishiroku 
Matsushita Minolta Ricoh Sharp and Toshiba were accused of 
making photocopiers in Europe using mainly components from Japan to 
get around a 20 percent antidumping duty on photocopier imports 
from Japan 
The EEC decided a year ago to impose the duties affecting the 
1 billion photocopier market EEC companies account for only 15 
percent of the market 
The Commission said that the latest complaint alleged that the 
Japanese companies had started or increased production of 
photocopiers in Europe when an initial antidumping inquiry started 
The complaint also charged that the value of the Japanese 
components in the photocopiers exceeded by 50 percent the value of 
all the other components used to make the machines 
In the case involving South Korea a group of European consumer 
electronics companies had complained that Korean imports were 
increasing by more than 100 percent a year and that prices of the 
television sets were considerably lower than those charged by EEC 
manufacturers 
The prices undercut EEC producers by as much as 38 percent 
forcing EEC manufacturers to cut prices according to the industry 
complaint 
EEC producers were alleged to have lost 6 percent of the EEC 
market as a result of the Korean dumping at a time when consumption 
rose by 11 percent the domestic industry claimed
