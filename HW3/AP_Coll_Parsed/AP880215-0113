From gypsy moths in the Shenandoah to wild 
pigs in the Great Smokies to creeping kudzu in the West an 
invasion of exotic animal and plant species is threating the 
nations national parks 
A draft summary of a major justcompleted National Park Service 
assessment of the condition of natural and cultural resources lists 
encroachment by plants and animals not native to park 
environments ahead of any other major issues and threats to 
natural resources 
Sometimes the invasion is part of the ebb and flow of nature as 
with gypsy moths attacking trees in Virginias Shenandoah National 
Park Sometimes it is the end of a complex process kicked off by 
humans as in the replacement of sawgrass with cattail plants in 
the Everglades National Park in Florida as a result of 
fertilizerladen water entering the swamp That changes the whole 
food chain in the park 
Sometimes it isnt easy to decide as with the ravages of 
vegetation caused by wild pigs in the Great Smoky Mountains 
National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina or goats in Olympic 
National Park in Washington State or the invasion of kudzu or 
eucalyptus at several sites in the South or West 
Sometimes nothing can really be done as nature slowly replaces 
one species with another over the course of a century or so 
In an interview parks director William Penn Mott said In the 
Florida everglades we have the invasion of the Brazilian pepper we 
have the invasion of the Australian pine It may be there is no 
way on Gods green earth that we can eliminate the pepper for 
example Over a period of time it may be that will be the 
ecology of the Florida Everglades 
Motts deputy Denis P Galvin added It seems to me one of 
the roles of the national parks is to illustrate that kind of 
process 
There are few really new individual facts about exotic species 
in the study just their appearance in different places 
What the assessment points out is that exotic plants and 
animals are a problem in more places than we would have thought 
said Galvin 
The study launched by Mott when he took over the service two 
years ago is the first of its kind since park managers were asked 
to list threats to their units in 1980 Results of the exercise 
which will be repeated every three years have been computerized 
for easy access throughout the park system 
Funds from new and increased visitor fees will be directed at 
what park managers judge the most important problems uncovered in 
the assessment This will mean an extra 52 million a year before 
collection expenses with 10 percent of the net reserved for a 
special directors discretionary fund to be spent on research and 
protection of resources or interpretation for visitors 
Nearly 60 percent of park managers said their installations were 
threatened in one way or another onethird of them by activities 
outside park boundaries 
Most natural resources were judged in fair condition with only 
15 percent described as poor But the managers said they needed to 
undertake 2500 projects over the next three years at what the 
service estimated would be 250 million to 300 million a sum it 
noted far exceeds the current NPS budget 
For cultural resources roughly half the units in the system 
commemorate something managers said a quarter of the sites a 
third of the buildings and a third of the collections were in good 
condition Most sites and structures that are welldocumented are 
relatively free of serious adverse impacts 
But the status of many cultural resources is unknown because 
of an enormous backlog of historical research documentation 
inspections and cataloguing the summary said in noting that only 
12 percent of its museum collections had been catalogued 
Major problem categories for natural resources many also 
listed in the 1980 report were described as scars from mining 
grazing or farming overuse hunting or poaching legal mineral 
exploitation loss of water and air quality as from acid rain and 
development near park boundaries 
Cultural resources were said to be threatened by weathering and 
erosion vandalism and looting deficient storage of artifacts a 
paperwork backlog lack of vegetation control and lack of 
specialized expertise
