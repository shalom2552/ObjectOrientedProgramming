A new package of purely humanitarian aid 
being drafted by House Democrats for Nicaraguas Contra rebels will 
continue supplying the resistance at the current rate of about 18 
million a month 
But House Speaker Jim Wright said Wednesday that other crucial 
questions about the aid package which is scheduled to come to the 
House floor next week remain unanswered 
Unresolved are such difficult issues as how the aid will be 
delivered its duration and what kinds of incentives might be 
offered to Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista government to encourage 
compliance with a regional peace accord 
It is taking shape Wright DTexas said of the proposal A 
group of House members primarily Democrats has been meeting daily 
to work out details of the bill which was promised as an 
alternative to the administrations 362 million aid package 
rejected on Feb 4 
In contrast with the administrations package which included 
36 million for ammunition and antiaircraft missiles and millions 
more for nonlethal military supplies Wrights proposal would be 
limited to food clothing and medical supplies and assistance 
The 18 million monthly figure does not include transportation 
costs which currently are costing a like amount each month but 
could be lower if the aid were delivered by an international 
neutral organization such as the Red Cross 
Rep David Bonior DMich who is leading the drafting 
sessions said the bill also will include a program to aid children 
injured during the sixyear civil war 
Wright said under consideration as well is a possible lifting of 
trade sanctions against Nicaragua and economic aid to other 
countries in the region contingent on fulfillment of promises of 
democratization made in the fivenation peace agreement 
But he emphasized that such moves could be made only with the 
enthusiastic backing of the administration which would be 
charged with carrying them out So far the administration and 
Republican congressional leaders have declined to participate in 
drafting the legislation 
Wright said the bill will seek to provide balanced 
incentives to encourage both the Contras and the Sandinistas to 
work out a ceasefire and live up to the peace agreement signed 
last Aug 7 
Both Wright and Bonior appeared cool to the idea mentioned 
earlier by House Majority Whip Tony Coelho DCalif that the 
legislation would include a ban or restriction on fundraising for 
the Contras by private US citizens 
I know of no provision contemplated Wright said when asked 
about the issue 
Meanwhile a congressional opponent of aid to the Contras asked 
President Reagan to strengthen assurances that US government 
personnel will not again become mired in private fund raising for 
the rebels as it did in the IranContra affair 
Rep David Obey DWis also asked that Reagan clarify the 
taxexempt status of a fund the Contras have established to solicit 
private contributions from US citizens 
Last week White House chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr and 
national security adviser Colin L Powell issued a memorandum 
directing that no administration official provide aid to 
private fundraising efforts for the Contras 
But because the memorandum was not issued by the president 
himself and was addressed only to White House and National Security 
Council staff members Contra opponents have questioned whether the 
directive contained an important loophole 
Obey chairman of the House Appropriations foreign operations 
subcommittee noted that federal law prohibits such activity and 
that all federal officials including those at the State Department 
and CIA should be covered by the White House prohibition 
He also raised questions about the Contras fundraising arm 
the Nicaraguan Resistance Education Foundation Contributions to 
the fund are taxdeductible 
Obey noted that the fund had been created last October simply by 
changing the name of another organization that already had 
taxexempt status the John Davis Lodge Foundation for 
International Studies
