Two US warships violated Soviet territorial 
waters ignored warnings from patrol craft and made dangerous 
maneuvers that led to collisions with Soviet ships in the Black 
Sea a Soviet admiral charged today 
Rear Adm Nikolai P Markov appeared at a hastily called news 
briefing to give the first detailed Kremlin version of the incident 
that happened off the Crimean peninsula in which two Soviet navy 
vessels grazed the American warships 
On Friday night the Defense Ministry accused the American 
vessels of violating Soviet waters but did not mention any 
physical contact between them and Soviet ships 
US Navy officials said the cruiser USS Yorktown and the 
destroyer USS Caron were deliberately bumped while exercising their 
right to pass through international waters 
However Markov and Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I 
Gerasimov told reporters the US warships were knowingly violating 
Soviet waters and said the collisions were the fault of the 
American captains 
Unlike the United States which claims a threemile territorial 
limit the Soviet Union claims a 12mile limit along its coast 
Gerasimov said US Ambassador Jack Matlock had been summoned to 
the Foreign Ministry today where Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander 
Bessmertnykh read him a strong protest 
The Soviet side cannot but view the actions of the United 
States Navy as aimed at undermining the process of improvement in 
SovietAmerican relations which has appeared recently Gerasimov 
said quoting from the protest 
US Navy Cmdr Richard Schiff a lawyer said Friday in 
Washington that any country claiming a 12mile territorial limit 
must allow for innocent passage by the ships of all nations 
But Markov and Gerasimov said Soviet law does not provide for 
the right of innocent passage in Black Sea waters which the 
Soviets have longed claimed as their own 
Markov was repeatedly asked to specify what he meant by 
dangerous maneuvers and said the American warships had been 
warned both before and after entering Soviet waters 
Generally one can and should regard the very fact of entering 
Soviet territorial waters as dangerous maneuvering he said 
He said the two Soviet warships identified by Pentagon 
officials as a Krivakclass frigate and a Mirkaclass patrol boat 
were on a basically parallel course with the US vessels when 
the grazings occurred 
The larger Krivakclass vessel brushed the left side of the 
Yorktown while the Caron was grazed on the same side by the patrol 
craft US officials said 
Both US and Soviet officials have said the grazings caused no 
injuries 
Markov did not name the Soviet warships but a small chart 
displayed at the briefing identified them as the frigate Bezzavetny 
and the patrol ship SKR6 
According to the chart the American warships steaming 
eastward entered Soviet waters at about 11 am Moscow time south 
of Sevastopol headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea fleet 
Markov said at one time the two American ships were as close as 
92 miles to shore He said they remained in Soviet territorial 
waters following the grazings 
The Yorktown left Soviet waters at 1221 pm Moscow time south 
of the resort city of Yalta and the Caron sailing north of the 
cruiser followed about a halfhour later according to the chart 
At last notice the two US vessels were back to routine 
operations in the Black Sea Navy Capt Gerry Flynn said Friday 
in Washington 
Markov said the Friday incident was the third of its kind in 
recent years 
In March 1986 the same two ships the Yorktown and the Caron 
violated Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea he said and 
two American warships penetrated Soviet waters off Kamchatka in the 
Soviet Far East last year 
In Washington a highranking State Department official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said that although the 
department had protested the Soviets behavior he did not expect 
the incident to disturb a USSoviet effort to narrow differences 
on arms control human rights regional disputes and bilateral 
issues 
Secretary of State George P Shultz is scheduled to go to Moscow 
in two weeks to further those efforts and talk about a USSoviet 
summit meeting tentatively scheduled in the Soviet capital in the 
spring
