Sen Paul Simon on Sunday turned his 
fire away from Rep Richard Gephardt and trained it on Gov Michael 
Dukakis generally seen as the frontrunner in New Hampshires 
primary on Tuesday 
Television ads that began airing Sunday show Simon describing 
himself as a candidate with compassion for people and Dukakis as a 
bureaucrat 
Mike Dukakis has accused me of being an oldfashioned 
Democrat Simon says in the commercial I plead guilty 
Its not enough to have ambition the fire in the belly to be 
president You should also have vision and substance and conviction 
and the fire in the heart for working men and women and the less 
fortunate he said 
Dukakis is expected to win the primary with Simon and Gephardt 
fighting it out for second place 
I think it is increasingly clear that Paul Simon is now ahead 
of Dick Gephardt the Illinois senator told reporters while 
campaigning in Manchester It is clear from the momentum the 
phone calling were making in New Hampshire 
Simon said polls have always underestimated his strength It 
was true four years ago when I ran for US Senate Not a single 
published poll showed me a winner It was true for Iowa last week 
Simon finished second behind Gephardt and ahead of Dukakis in 
the Iowa caucuses last Monday He needs a strong showing in the New 
Hampshire primary to stay in tne race and to put him in a better 
position to raise funds for his campaign which is a half million 
dollars in debt 
Simon said that making Dukakis the focus of his new ads had 
nothing to do with Gephardts criticism of his television campaign 
against the Missouri congressman In the earlier advertising blitz 
Simon had accused Gephardt of coming up with campaign themes that 
ran counter to his voting record 
After the news conference Simon campaigned in the streets and 
one of his stops was the Dukakis campaign headquarters where he 
greeted workers 
He also made a stop at a florists to buy Valentines Day roses 
for his wife Jeanne who was accompanying him 
Earlier at the Temple Israel he telephoned Elena KeisKuna a 
Soviet refusenik who has been on a hunger strike for 12 days in 
Leningrad 
I just want to wish you the very best Simon told Mrs 
KeisKuna who has been trying to get visas to Israel for herself 
her husband and her son We are grateful to you for your 
courage
