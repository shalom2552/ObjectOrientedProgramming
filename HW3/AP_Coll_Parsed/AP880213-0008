The crew of a Continental Airlines jet 
aborted takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport Friday 
after foreign objects entered the jets engines and bent some of 
its turbine blades 
No one was injured as Continental flight 581 bound for Denver 
with 139 passengers started rolling down the runway and then 
slowed to a stop at about 7 am 
Bruce Hicks a spokesman for the airline said passengers were 
transferred to other flights 
Airline officials at first suspected that ice may have been 
hurled by the wheels into the twin rearmounted engines But Hicks 
said that inspections indicated that the problem may have been 
caused by something on the airfield 
Visual and hand inspection of the McDonnell Douglas aircraft 
found no ice on the wings or engines before the plane left the gate 
Hicks said further testing of the engine blades is planned to 
determine the cause of the incident
