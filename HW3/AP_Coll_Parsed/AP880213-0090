Bertie and John Weaver dont go out to a fancy 
restaurant or even share a romantic candlelight dinner to celebrate 
their wedding anniversary 
After 80 years of marriage the couple prefers a simple 
observance of the event that took place on July 27 1907 They just 
remember the good times and give thanks for the life theyve had 
together since their marriage at age 16 
Weve had so many anniversaries that we dont make much 
todo over them anymore Weaver once said 
The Weavers who live in Glenloch a rural community in Heard 
County about 60 miles west of Atlanta have had so many 
anniversaries in fact that theyve been honored as the Longest 
Married Couple in the nation 
The distinction was bestowed on them by the Worldwide Marriage 
Encounter an international nonprofit organization dedicated to 
the enrichment of all marriages 
Charley Anton and his wife IdaMarie coordinators for the group 
in Atlanta found out about the Weavers more than a year ago when a 
grandson nominated them for the honor The Weavers held the 
distinction for the state of Georgia last year and moved to 
national prominence this year 
The award is given each year on World Marriage Day which 
Antons group marks on the second Sunday of February this year it 
happens to fall on Valentines Day 
Theyre really a warm gentle couple Anton said 
Theyre just amazed at the award said Mary Steed the 
couples daughter who lives near them and visits on weekends and 
if needed during the week They do a lot of talking and 
grumbling 
The Weavers now both 96 have been ill recently and not up to 
talking with reporters about their lengthy marriage Anton said 
But in a chat with Anton Weaver attributed the longevity of the 
relationship to the good Lord watching over us working together 
respecting each others feelings being good to one another and 
being understanding with one another 
The simple life is the best life 
In a previous newspaper interview Weaver said he and his wife 
get along as good as two people ever could I help her with 
anything she needs Every now and then well bring up a quarrel 
but not often 
Despite their age and fragile health Weaver gets up each 
morning and makes breakfast for his wife 
Married over the objections of Mrs Weavers family the couple 
had 13 children six still are living 50 grandchildren 87 
greatgrandchildren and seven greatgreatgrandchildren 
Mrs Weavers family objected to her choice of a husband because 
he was the son of a sawmill worker Although the wedding was 
supposed to be secret her family found out and lined the road when 
Weaver came to pick up his bride for the ceremony 
I took a back road and picked her up and headed for the 
justice of the peace said Weaver who also was a sawmill worker 
The Weavers reaction to being named as the Longest Married 
Couple in the United States is mixed Anton said On the one hand 
Anton said theyre enjoying the attention But it has made them 
very much aware of their age
