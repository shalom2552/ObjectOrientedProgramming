President Reagan proposed on Thursday to cut 
spending for agriculture in fiscal 1989 by 5 percent including 
sharp reductions for two major rural development agencies 
The Reagan budget does not call for new legislation or cuts in 
most farm commodity programs Officials said the one major 
exception will be an administration attempt to overhaul the US 
sugar program which includes protective import quotas and price 
supports 
Food programs including school lunches and food stamps were 
left largely unchanged A year ago for example the administration 
sought to exclude children from affluent families from sharing in 
the subsidized school lunch program No such attempt was made this 
time 
The USDA proposals include sharp cutbacks in rural housing 
programs operated by the Farmers Home Administration to less than 
14 billion in 1989 from outlays of more than 33 billion this 
year 
Direct loans by the Rural Electrification Administration to 
electric and telephone borrowers would be replaced by a system of 
70 percent guaranteed loans from private lenders That would mean a 
net REA saving of 478 million 
Agriculture Secretary Richard E Lyng has previously supported 
legislation that would reduce the sugar price support from the 
current 18 cents a pound to 12 cents so domestic sugar would be 
more competitive with imports 
Lyng contends the high price supports artificially stimulate 
US domestic production thus forcing the United States to impose 
tighter quotas on imports 
The budget reference to overhauling the sugar program brought a 
critical reponse from Dalton Yancey a member of the executive 
committee of the US Sweetener Producers Group which wants to 
keep the current program 
If the administration prevails the winners will be the giant 
industrial corporations that use sweeteners to make soft drinks 
candy and processed foods he said The losers will be hundreds 
of thousands of American farmers who produce sugar cane beets 
and sweeteneryielding corn he said 
On the other side Tom Hammer president of the Sweetener Users 
Association called the current program a costly sham paid for by 
taxpayers and said it is appropriate that this issue be 
addressed in Reagans budget message 
Under the proposed budget to operate USDA in the year beginning 
Oct 1 total spending would be held to 483 billion down from 
the estimated outlays of 507 billion in the current fiscal year 
Part of the savings described by USDA budget analysts comes from 
the improved US farm economy a pickup in commodity exports and 
general improvements in the agricultural supplyanddemand 
situation 
A report by USDA budget analysts said the departments 1989 
spending blueprint is consistent with the budget summit 
agreement reached last November between the administration and 
congressional leaders 
The budget does not renew proposals made a year ago for 
fiscal 1988 for new user fees changes in the Forest Service 
payments to states changes in the food assistance program or 
privatization of the crop insurance program the report said 
Other than for the sugar program the budget does not propose 
changes in farm price support programs 
Most of the cutbacks in the farm commodity programs were already 
endorsed by Congress in the Food Security Act of 1985 or in 
subsequent legislation The 76 billion deficit reduction package 
approved in December for example included a long list of money 
savers that will spill over into next fiscal year 
Cutbacks in target prices for major crops changes in basic 
formulas for price support loans to farmers and many other 
adjustments and reductions were approved by Congress and are 
reflected in the proposed budget for USDA operations 
The Reagan budget shows total outlays for farm commodity 
programs in 1989 dropping to 171 billion from a revised estimate 
of about 177 billion this year Outlays rose to a record of 258 
billion in 1986 before declining to 224 billion in 1987 also a 
revised figure 
Analysts said the twoyear total for commodity program outlays 
of 348 billion represents a savings of 49 billion from 
estimates last August for 198889 program spending 
Of this amount 25 billion in savings can be attributed to 
the provisions of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 and 24 
billion in savings to improved supplyanddemand conditions they 
said 
But the longstanding drive by the White House to eliminate at 
least two rural development programs operated by FmHA took another 
turn Requests were included to operate water and sewer loans at 
250 million and business and industrial development loan 
guarantees at 96 million 
Some other items 
Food stamps proposed at 125 billion remained virtually the 
same as this year Average participation is projected to decline 
slightly to about 188 million people 
The FmHA would boost its level of farm operating loans to 4 
billion from 31 billion this year with guarantees to private 
lenders accounting for a larger share 
Research and education programs at 119 billion would be 
down from 125 billion in estimated outlays this year Emphasis 
would be on groundwater protection rural development and food 
safety 
Outlays for marketing and inspection services would be reduced 
to 860 million from 871 million
