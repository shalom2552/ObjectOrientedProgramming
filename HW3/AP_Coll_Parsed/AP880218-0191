A recordbreaking mess and fewer arrests were 
two measures of success for what may have been New Orleans biggest 
Mardi Gras But another grimmer statistic three deaths dimmed 
the Carnival afterglow 
Carnival season begins each Jan 6 and builds to a raucous 
climax on Mardi Gras French for Fat Tuesday the day before the 
start of the Christian Lenten season 
Police started keeping track of arrests Feb 5 the day of the 
first major parades And sanitation crews started weighing the 
morningafter garbage the next day 
While some people use the intensity of their hangovers to gauge 
how much fun they had Cecil MacFarland uses the weight of the 
garbage his sanitation crews pick up during the 12day parade 
season to judge Mardi Gras success 
We havent finished that MacFarland said when asked if he 
had totalled up the tonnage yet Its gonna take me another three 
days 
MacFarland said close to 2000 tons of garbage already had been 
collected by noon Wednesday 
We think we may pass last years record breaker of 2001 
tons he said 
Although garbage was up arrests were down Police Capt John 
Hughes said there were 1621 arrests for various offenses A year 
ago it was 1948 and two years ago it was 2072 Hughes said He 
attributed the declining numbers to people behaving themselves 
Although police say exact crowd estimates are difficult to make 
veteran officers said Tuesdays crowds within the city limits were 
among the largest theyve seen and likely surpassed the million 
mark That was good economic news for a city experiencing hard 
times a recent University of New Orleans study indicates that a 
good Carnival crowd can pump as much as 275 million into the 
economy 
While crowds were generally well behaved getting too close to 
moving carnival vehicles cost two lives 
Witnesses at a parade in suburban Jefferson Parish said 
11yearold Michael Dupree darted under a decorated truck to grab 
Carnival trinkets tossed by riders and was crushed by the wheels of 
the slowmoving vehicle He had grabbed items that had landed under 
other parade vehicles and had been warned by deputies and his 
sister to stay clear of the vehicles witnesses said 
In a separate incident in New Orleans a man ran into traffic 
after a paade and tried to hop aboard a truck float that was 
leaving the city He fell beneath the wheels of the tractortrailer 
rig His identity had not been confirmed Wednesday afternoon 
The area had not recorded such paraderelated deaths since 1983 
Another apparent fatality occurred when an officer with the 
Mississippi River Bridge Police assigned to help control Mardi Gras 
crowds on a ferry slipped into the river as he helped pull aboard a 
woman who had fallen off the vessel He disappeared in the water
