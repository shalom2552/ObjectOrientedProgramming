Southern political leaders from both parties 
on Wednesday outlined a series of issues they want the presidential 
candidates to address as they shift their attention to Super 
Tuesday 
A report prepared for the candidates by the Sunbelt Institute 
and the Congressional Sunbelt Caucus detailed issues ranging from 
rural development to welfare reform to energy and environmental 
policy 
Former Virginia Gov Chuck Robb told a news conference that the 
report lists problems that need attention in the South but does 
not outline a list of acceptable solutions that might be 
interpreted as a Southern litmus test for the presidential 
candidates 
Rep Michael A Andrews DTexas chairman of the sunbelt 
caucus said the report will help define and clarify some of the 
issues that confront the nation and our region 
The candidates have got to change their focus and address 
issues of concern to our region he said For the first time 
the Souths political voice through Super Tuesday will match the 
Souths number of voters 
Andrews said for example that none of the candidates have 
explained their goals and plans for the space program which is 
vital to the economies of Alabama Texas and Florida 
He said the South also is facing a social crisis with one out 
of every five Southerns on welfare and the presidential candidates 
will be expected to respond with meaningful welfare reform 
proposals 
Rep Jim Cooper DTenn said the level of illiteracy in the 
South is a major problem that Southern voters want the presidential 
candidates to address as they head toward Super Tuesday 
A total of 20 states 14 of them in the South will hold 
primaries or caucuses on Super Tuesday March 8 The Democrats will 
be vying for 1307 delegates in 20 states while the Republicans 
battle for 700 delegates in 16 states
