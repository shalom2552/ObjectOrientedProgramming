Geraldine Ferraro whose vice presidential 
nomination marked a peak for the womens equality movement said 
Friday that women must translate their increasing power at the 
ballot box to campaigns for elective office 
If you dont run you cant win Ms Ferraro said And 
just as important every time a woman runs women win 
Ms Ferraro addressed some 1500 women attending a symposium on 
women and the Constitution convened by former first ladies Rosalynn 
Carter and Lady Bird Johnson 
She said there are more female officeholders than ever but the 
numbers are not representative of the population 
Women are by any measure grossly underrepresented in 
elective office Ms Ferraro said I would say shockingly 
underrepresented however nobody is shocked Thats simply how it 
is 
Coretta Scott King wife of slain civil rights leader Martin 
Luther King Jr echoed Ms Ferraro in urging women particularly 
black women to seek office 
We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for nurturing and 
compassion which has been finely honed and tempered in our struggle 
to raise families in a sexist society Mrs King said on the 
closing day of the twoday symposium 
Let me put it this way if the women of America dont lead 
the struggle against poverty racism and militarism then we must 
ask who will she said 
According to the National Womens Political Caucus in 1987 
women held 14 percent of the higher statewide elective offices in 
the country At the same time there are only 23 women serving in 
the House and only one black woman two female governors and two 
women in the Senate 
Ms Ferraro a former congresswoman from New York said many of 
those officeholders are not yet in positions of national power or 
leadership which she said would likely delay nomination of a woman 
as a presidential candidate 
However more women will become interested in politics and the 
numbers elected will increase she said Ms Ferraro said her 1984 
campaign with Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale 
inspired thousands of women to write her and describe how the 
candidacy inspired them to go to law school medical school or run 
for office 
Every time a woman runs for any elective office its like 
throwing a stone in a lake she said The ripple effect is felt 
far beyond the immediate point of impact 
Mrs King compared the challenge facing women in the workplace 
and in politics to that faced by blacks during the civil rights 
struggle led by her late husband She said women can learn much 
from the tactics used by blacks to gain rights 
The movement showed millions of Americans that you can indeed 
you must defy authority when that authority is in the wrong 
Mrs King said 
Women have become a distinct and powerful voting group in recent 
years Ms Ferraro said pointing to the 1986 midterm elections 
that brought a Democratic majority to the Senate She said nine 
Democrats won by getting less than 50 percent of the male vote and 
more than 50 percent of the female vote 
Women voted more strongly Democratic and on key issues like 
peace disarmament social welfare and the environment differently 
from men she said 
Ms Ferraro said that after she was nominated for vice president 
during the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco 
the thousands of joyfully weeping women she saw told her that 
equality and a female president are coming 
She will have shown that she possesses the rare combination of 
qualities the American people look for in a president and then it 
will be time And tears will be cried like you wouldnt believe 
she said
