A hazardous gas leaked Sunday for the third 
time since late January from an International Paper Co mill that 
has continued operating during a strike and seven people were 
taken to hospitals officials said 
IP officials said no one was exposed outside the mill Jay Town 
Manager Charles Noonan said no evacuation outside the mill area was 
necessary 
A preliminary investigation indicated that the chlorine gas 
escaped from a chemicalsampling line when a bleaching plant in the 
mill shut down IP said 
The problem apparently resulted from the failure of a valve to 
shut off automatically after a cutoff of electricity halted the 
bleaching process said Willis Lyford a spokesman for Gov John R 
McKernan Jr 
The leak lasted about 10 to 15 minutes and was largely contained 
within a mill building Lyford said 
IP spokesman Rick Ouellette said the injured workers were 
outside contractors and not Androscoggin mill employees who 
were working on a capital project in the pulp mill 
He said the area was cleared within five minutes and workers 
returned to the affected area within 45 minutes 
It wasnt a human error that caused the leak said 
Ouellette It was a problem in the process and that is being 
investigated 
The commissioners of Maines Human Services and Labor 
departments toured the mill Sunday afternoon with officials from 
the Department of Environmental Protection Lyford said 
The governor who also sent his public safety commissioner to 
the mill ordered IP to cease its bleaching operations in which 
chlorine is used 
McKernan called for a thorough inspection by the federal 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration after a leak of more 
than 100000 gallons of chlorine dioxide Feb 4 OSHA said Tuesday 
that it would assign inspectors to the mill in an effort to prevent 
future leaks 
The leak of chlorine dioxide which like chlorine is used in the 
bleaching process forced nearly 4000 people to leave Jay and 
nearby communities for several hours 
On Jan 28 eight workers were rushed to hospitals after a 
hydrogen sulfide gas leak at the mill 
Noonan said Jay officials are worried about potential injuries 
to residents as well as mill employees 
We remain very interested in what goes on at that mill said 
Noonan He criticized legislators last week for doing too little to 
defuse what he sees as a volatile situation in a town already tense 
over an 8monthold labor dispute at the paper mill 
More than 1200 members of United Paperworkers International 
Union and the International Brotherhood of Firemen amp Oilers at the 
IP mill have been on strike since midJune IP has hired hundreds 
of what it calls permanent replacements 
Five workers were taken to Franklin Memorial Hospital in 
Farmington and three were admitted in stable but guarded condition 
and two were released said spokesman Kevin Flynn who said 
chlorine gas can be extremely toxic 
They are all conscious alert and responsive said Flynn 
adding that effects of chlorine poisoning can show up 12 to 18 
hours after exposure 
A spokeswoman at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston said 
two people taken there were released Sunday afternoon
