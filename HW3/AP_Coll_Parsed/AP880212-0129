Now that Wall Street has been in a bear market 
for nearly six months some venturesome investors are searching out 
cheap stocks to buy 
Of course just about all the merchandise a stockbroker has to 
offer has been marked down significantly since last summer But 
some stocks may upon appraisal look cheaper than others 
How to identify them One handy way is to plug several 
statistical measures into a computer program and instruct the 
machine to search the market for stocks that meet those criteria 
Norman Weinger and Michael Metz analysts at the investment firm 
of Oppenheimer amp Co who are well known on Wall Street for screens 
of this type have just completed one 
They found deep discount stocks predominating in electric 
utilities banking insurance savings and loans and some 
householdname blue chips as well 
No investment decision is warranted on the basis of these 
figures alone they caution If a stock is out of favor there 
are likely to be excellent reasons why 
The data should be used as a starting point in a quest for 
unusually attractive values Weinger and Metz say 
The analysts set three standards for a stock to qualify as 
deeply discounted 
Its priceearnings ratio had to be at least onethird below 
the average for the market as a whole as measured by Standard amp 
Poors index of 400 industrials 
It must carry a dividend yield at least onethird more than 
the SampP 400 
The ratio of its stock price to book value or theoretical 
worth if the company were to be liquidated had to be at least 
onethird below the aggregate ratio for the SampP 400 
The two biggest names that showed up on Weinger and Metzs 
screen were General Motors and Sears Roebuck prime examples of 
companies that clearly would be affected by any slowdown in 
consumer spending the analysts noted 
Also conspicuous by its presence is Merrill Lynch reflecting 
the depressed state of the securities industry 
Numerous banking concerns also made the leastloved list thanks 
if that is the right word to worries about loans in Third World 
countries and in real estate and energy deals that investors are 
worried about 
Representatives from the insurance industry include such 
prominent participants as Aetna Cigna Continental and Travelers 
From the savings and loan group HF Ahmanson Calfed and Great 
Western Financial 
And then there are no less than 57 utilities from Atlantic 
Energy to Pacificorp 
This is Weinger and Metz say an industry undergoing 
significant change Perhaps the most important change is that 
capital requirements eg for new plants and other facilities 
are tending to flatten or decline 
As a result some utilities are becoming net cash generators 
rather than the insatiable consumers of capital they were in the 
1970s 
It is estimated that the industry in aggregate will be able to 
cover its capital requirements entirely from internal cash 
generation by 1989 This development has favorable implications for 
the industrys investment status 
Improving debttoequity ratios could provide the basis for an 
upward valuation of the group enabling utility companies to pay 
out a larger proportion of reported earnings in dividends 
The group may command considerably greater investment interest 
as a result of the recent market decline and greater concern about 
prospects for continued economic growth
