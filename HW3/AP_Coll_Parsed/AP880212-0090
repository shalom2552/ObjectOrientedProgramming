A former nurses aide who is serving life 
prison terms for 34 slayings was indicted Friday for the murders or 
attempted murders of six more patients at Cincinnatis Drake 
Memorial Hospital 
Donald Harvey is expected to plead guilty to the indictments 
next week when he is brought to Cincinnati from his Lucasville 
state prison cell assistant Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph 
Deters said 
Under a continuing pleabargain agreement with prosecutors the 
new guilty pleas will not lengthen Harveys current sentence of 
three consecutive life terms in an Ohio prison Deters said 
Harvey 35 of Middletown Ohio will be eligible for parole in 
60 years prosecutors have said 
The Hamilton County grand jury indictment returned charges that 
Harvey fatally poisoned two of the patients killed another by 
suffocation and poisoned the three patients who survived Families 
of the victims have been notified Deters said 
The indictment charges Harvey with three counts of aggravated 
murder and three of attempted aggravated murder alleging that the 
crimes occurred between April and November 1986 The victims were 
identified as patients at Drake a Hamilton Countyowned hospital 
that provides longterm care and rehabilitative services Harvey 
was employed at Drake as a nurses aide from February 1986 until 
his April 1987 arrest 
Authorities identified the three patients who were killed as 
Nathaniel Watson by suffocation and poisoning victims Doris 
Nalley and Henry Cody The three who survived poisonings were 
identified as Lawrence Bernsden Willie Johnson and Anna Hood 
Officials declined to provide the patients hometowns or ages 
Harvey pleaded guilty last August to Ohio charges that he killed 
25 people including 21 Drake patients 
Harvey knows of more murders his lawyer William Whalen Jr of 
Cincinnati said Friday 
We know there are more but either they arent establishable 
or Donald needs additional assistance with them Whalen said 
But Deters said he anticipates no further indictments against 
Harvey Hopefully this is the end of his story he said 
Harvey is serving a concurrent Kentucky life sentence for the 
deaths of nine patients at Marymount Hospital in London Ky when 
he worked there from 1970 to 1971
