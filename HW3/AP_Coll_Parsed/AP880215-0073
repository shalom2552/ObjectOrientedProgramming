Gen Manuel Noriegas American lawyers maintaining 
US drug trafficking charges against the Panamanian military 
leader are politically motivated said they would seek a dismissal 
of the indictment this week 
Lawyer Raymond Takiff said Sunday that the defense team would 
meet Tuesday with prosecutors but refused to say why 
He also said he would seek access to the minutes of the Miami 
grand jury that indicted Noriega Panamas military leader and de 
facto ruler 
General Noriega told us that he has always been a friend of 
the United States and is still a friend of the United States 
Takiff said Sunday after arriving at Miami International Airport 
He had been consulting with Noriega about the federal 
indictments handed up earlier this month in Tampa and Miami Takiff 
shrugged off a key witness testimony against Noriega 
Jose Blandon the former Panamanian consul general in New York 
wants to be the next president of Panama Takiff said 
Blandon who was fired in January testified before the Miami 
federal grand jury and before a US congressional subcommittee 
about Noriegas alleged involvement in cocaine trafficking 
He also said the CIA had provided Noriega with confidential 
information on Sens Edward Kennedy and Jesse Helms which the CIA 
denied 
The defense team has material which portrays the long and 
intricate involvement of Jose Blandon with the Communist Party 
in both Panama and Puerto Rico Takiff claimed 
Noriegas lawyers also claimed their client has information that 
could influence the US presidential election 
We were given access by General Noriega to files which contain 
political dynamite files which could affect the upcoming 
presidential election in the United States and the positions of 
other nations said Takiff who refused to elaborate 
Right now were just going to sit tight with them the 
files If we have to use them well use them vowed defense 
lawyer Frank Rubino
