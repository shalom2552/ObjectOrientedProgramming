The Reagan administration on Thursday said the 
economy was shrugging off the impact of the October stock market 
collapse and would enjoy modest growth this presidential election 
year with no threat of a recession 
In its 1989 budget request the administration foresaw no storm 
clouds on the economic horizon contending that growth would slow 
during the first half of 1988 but then rebound to robust levels in 
1989 and beyond 
The administrations economic forecasts which provide the 
underpinning for its assumptions on revenues and spending in the 
budget have been attacked in the past as rosy scenarios which 
bore little resemblance to reality 
But this years version was greeted with less skepticism 
although it was still more optimistic than the outlook prepared by 
the Congressional Budget Office and most private economists 
In the last couple of years the administration has lightened 
the tint on their rosecolored glasses although their outlook is 
still a lot rosier than we think is justified said David Wyss 
an economist with Data Resources Inc one of the countrys leading 
economic forecasting firms 
The administration derided as greatly exaggerated the 
recession fears stirred by the record 508point drop in the New 
York Stock Exchanges Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct 19 
contending that the economy had escaped with few signs of serious 
damage 
The administration predicted the gross national product the 
total output of goods and services would expand at a modest rate 
of 24 percent this year down from 38 percent growth in 1987 
when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 
Congressional analysts are forecasting lower growth of 18 
percent in 1988 and Wyss said Data Resources has just scaled back 
its own GNP forecast to 14 percent a full percentage point below 
the administration 
Lower economic growth means less tax revenue for the government 
and thus larger budget deficits 
The administration calls for reducing the deficit to 1295 
billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct 1 down from an 
actual deficit of 1502 billion in 1987 and an estimated 1467 
billion in the current fiscal year 
In its longrange forecasts the administration sees the deficit 
still at 793 billion in 1991 slightly above the 78 billion 
deficit the government was running in 1981 when Ronald Reagan took 
office with a pledge to balance the budget within three years 
In its eighth budget to Congress the administration blamed some 
familiar foes for its biggest economic failure the doubling of the 
national debt The administration placed much of the blame on 
Congress for failing to accept Reagans program of domestic 
spending cuts It also cited the 198182 recession saying the 
severe downturn boosted the deficit by 112 billion in 1983 alone 
The administration conceded that a worsethanexpected economic 
performance could doom even its more modest expectations on deficit 
reductions The budget document said that if economic growth is 
just 1 percent lower than the administration is forecasting over 
the next five years it would add 63 billion to the 1989 deficit 
and 66 billion to the 1993 deficit 
In its economic assumptions the administration forecast 
GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 35 percent rate and stay 
above 3 percent through 1993 Many private economists expect the 
new president will very likely face a recession in 1989 or 1990 
The current recovery has already lasted a peacetime record of 63 
months twice as long as the normal recovery 
Consumer prices which rose 44 percent last year will rise 
by 43 percent this year and decline steadily over the next four 
years to a 2 percent rate of inflation in 1993 
Unemployment will show no improvement this year because of 
the modest growth forecast but will not get worse either holding 
steady at the current 58 percent rate In following years the 
jobless rate which many economists believe is approaching 
effective full employment will dip slightly to 52 percent by the 
end of 1993
