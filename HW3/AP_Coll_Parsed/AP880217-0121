The state parole board today ordered 
convicted rapist Gary Dotson who was freed by the governor when 
his accuser recanted in 1985 to return to prison for at least six 
months for violating his parole 
The Illinois Prisoner Review Board said it had declared Dotson a 
parole violator for failing to report to his parole officer on Dec 
24 
Dotson was convicted of rape in 1979 In 1985 Cathleen Crowell 
Webb now a New Hampshire homemaker recanted her testimony that 
Dotson had raped her when she was a teenager 
After three days of hearings in 1985 Gov James R Thompson 
commuted Dotsons 25 to 50year sentence to time served The 
governor did not pardon Dotson saying he did not believe the 
recantation 
After several subsequent brushes with the law Dotson was again 
threatened with prison 
Todays decision involved Dotsons failure to check in with a 
parole officer and a confrontation he had at a suburban bar 
The board ordered Dotson held in state prison until Aug 16 
when he will be eligible for parole again said Nic Howell a 
spokesman for the state Department of Corrections 
During the six months he is in prison Dotson was ordered by the 
board to join a substanceabuse program Dotson told the board 
during a hearing Tuesday at the Joliet Correctional Center that he 
is an alcoholic and needed treatment 
Hes going to remain in prison for six months and then hed be 
transferred into some sort of a communitybased rehabilitation 
program at that time Aug 16 as a condition of his parole 
Howell said today by telephone from Springfield 
At Tuesdays hearing Dotson 30 said I plan on seeking 
fulltime treatment 
Earlier last year he was convicted on drunken driving charges 
and was later returned to prison for violating terms of parole 
after that conviction 
He was paroled Christmas Eve in what Thompson called a 
lastchance deal But Dotson failed to check in with his parole 
officer and two days later was involved in a confrontation at a 
bar that landed him back behind bars 
Prosecutors have dropped battery charges against Dotson in the 
incident in which officials said he had argued with bar employees 
over a sandwich and stabbed a cook in the hand
