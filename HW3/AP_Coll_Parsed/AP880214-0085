A rocket booster motor being tested for 
use in the Titan IV space launch vehicle startled more than a 
thousand residents Sunday with its sensational rumble and smoke 
authorities said 
Officials at the San Jose Police Department and Santa Clara 
County Sheriffs Office logged 1300 calls after the twominute 
demonstration firing in the mountains south of San Jose at 1230 
pm 
Most of them just heard the big noise and saw the smoke and 
wanted to know what happened police Officer David Aguilar said 
A plume of fire rose about 800 feet into the air topped off by 
a spectacular smoke cloud rising several thousand feet before 
dispersing according to United Technologies Chemical System which 
is producing the sevensegment solid rocket booster motor 
The thrust was created by propulsive gases from almost 600000 
pounds of propellant squeezed through a narrow nozzle resulting in 
a lowfrequency rumble heard in varying degrees around the San Jose 
area
