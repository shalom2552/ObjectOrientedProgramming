Bond prices stagnated or fell marginally 
Wednesday in light trading reflecting fresh uncertainty over the 
outlook for interest rates and the economys direction 
The Treasurys 30year issue lost about 2 per 1000 in face 
amount Its yield which moves inversely to price and is considered 
a sign of interest rate trends rose to 848 percent from 846 
percent late Tuesday 
Bond prices generally had been rising and interest rates falling 
this year up until last Friday when economic statistics suggested 
the economy isnt slowing down significantly despite the stock 
market crash in October 
Signs of a slowdown or impending recession often rally the bond 
market because they imply the Federal Reserve will ease credit 
conditions But Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan obscured the Feds 
intentions on Tuesday when he said important features of the 
economy seem stable Bond prices fell as a result 
On the other hand fresh economic evidence reported Wednesday 
suggested recession remains a possibility The Commerce Department 
said housing construction fell in January to the lowest level since 
the end of the last recession and the Fed said industrial 
production grew only marginally 
I think the whole range of numbers have gone from imminent 
recession to that of a more balanced approach so we dont know 
where were going said William Veronda director of fixedincome 
investments at Financial Programs Inc in Denver Its really 
painted a mixed bag 
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were unchanged intermediate maturities fell 132 point 
and longterm issues fell about 316 point the financial 
information service Telerate Inc said 
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer fell 009 to 11305 The Shearson Lehman Daily 
Treasury Bond Index which makes a similar measurement fell 040 
to 118263 
In corporate transactions industrials were largely unchanged 
and utilities fell point in light trading 
Moodys Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer rose 024 to 28210 
Among taxexempt municipal bonds general obligations fell about 
point and dollar bonds were unchanged municipal traders said 
Business was light 
Yields on threemonth Treasury bills were unchanged at 573 
percent A basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
Sixmonth bills fell 4 points to 598 percent and year bills were 
unchanged at 629 percent
