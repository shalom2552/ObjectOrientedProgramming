Frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices fell sharply 
Tuesday as warmer weather moved into Floridas orangegrove country 
and melted fears of a freeze 
On other markets livestock and meat futures were mostly higher 
grains and soybeans were mixed precious metals were lower energy 
futures retreated and stockindex futures advanced 
Forecasts late last week for cold weather in Florida had some 
orange juice traders on the New York Cotton Exchange worried but 
the orange crop escaped freeze damage said Judy Ganes an analyst 
in New York for the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc 
Rich Cantor of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc said last 
weekend may have held the seasons last threat of a freeze 
Florida escaped what may have been one of its last cold spells 
from a seasonal perspective Cantor said People may have seen 
that and sold it off 
Ms Ganes also noted a widening of the gap between prices for 
nearterm and deferred delivery The March contract settled 240 
cents lower at 1661 a pound more than 5 cents higher than the 
settlement price for May delivery 
The pattern indicated concerns about tight supplies for 
immediate delivery she said 
Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange in positionevening in front of the Agriculture 
Departments monthly sevenstate cattleonfeed report 
The report issued after the close showed an 8 percent increase 
during January in the number of a cattle being fattened for 
slaughter 
The total of more than 785 million head on feed was greater 
than most analysts had expected which could drive cattle futures 
lower on Wednesday said Philip Stanley an analyst in Chicago for 
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc 
However the report also showed 166 million head placed on 
feedlots during January and 176 million head removed from feedlots 
to be slaughtered 
Stanley said those numbers indicated supplies and demand for fed 
cattle were running close to even which should limit any downward 
move in prices 
I think the nearterm bias for the markets shouldnt be too 
affected Stanley said The feedlots are current and the 
nearterm supply side of this market is doing just fine 
Live cattle settled 22 cent to 50 cent higher with February at 
7187 cents a pound feeder cattle were 07 cent to 33 cent higher 
with March at 8337 cents a pound hogs were 02 cent to 40 cent 
higher with February at 4757 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 42 cent lower to 05 cent higher with February at 5570 cents 
a pound 
Corn and soybean futures closed lower while wheat finished 
mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade 
Soybean prices were pressured by a variety of factors including 
speculative profittaking increased farmer selling on cash markets 
and improved soybean growing conditions in South America 
Corn futures also retreated on profittaking and farmer selling 
analysts said 
Most wheat contracts advanced on rumors the Soviet Union was set 
to buy at least 500000 metric tons of US wheat said Victor 
Lespinasse a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc 
After the close the USDA announced it had sold 161 million
