Sen Joseph R Biden Jr was alert and talking 
with family members today after undergoing surgery at Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center to correct an aneurysm in an artery supplying 
blood to his brain 
The 45yearold Deleware Democrat was progressing 
satisfactorily this morning and was as comfortable as 
possible hospital spokesman Pete Esker said 
Biden underwent a surgical procedure known as a clipping to 
correct the aneurysm which is a sac formed by local enlargement of 
the weakened wall of an artery 
Esker said Bidens aneurysm was within his cranium underneath 
the brain but not inside the brain itself 
Pete Smith an aide to Biden said Biden was listed in 
seriously ill condition but was expected to suffer no 
significant aftereffects from the surgery 
The surgery did not involve the removal of any brain tissue 
and there is every indication that the senator will recover 
satisfactorily Smith said He is awake alert oriented and 
moving all extremities well The length of his hospital stay will 
depend on his continued progress 
Clipping is a microsurgical technique in which a minute 
metal clip is slipped around the aneurysm parallel to the artery 
The aneurysm is then deflated and the artery heals The clip is 
left in place 
Smith said the surgery was performed in Friday afternoon but 
there was no immediate information on when it began or how long it 
took 
I am told that he is in intensive care which Walter Reed said 
is normal for surgical patients and his family is with him at the 
hospital Smith said Biden and his wife Jill have three 
children 
Biden was admitted to the hospital early Friday after being 
transferred from St Francis Hospital in Wilmington Del where 
the senator lives 
Biden a threeterm senator had been complaining for a couple 
of weeks about what had been diagnosed as a pinched nerve in his 
neck 
He wore a neck brace two weeks ago during hearings on the 
proposed Intermediaterange Nuclear Forces treaty with the Soviet 
Union He was ill and unable to vote last week on the confirmation 
of Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court Biden as chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Commitee had led the committee hearings on 
Kennedys nomination to the top court 
This week Biden felt well enough to appear for several speaking 
engagements at colleges on the East Coast 
The senator last June announced he was a candidate for the 
presidency but withdrew from the race in September in the wake of 
disclosures that he committed plagiarism during law school and 
exaggerated his academic accomplishments during campaign stops
