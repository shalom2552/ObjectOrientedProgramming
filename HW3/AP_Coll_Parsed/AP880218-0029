The government and manufacturers of 
allterrain vehicles are taking about three extra weeks to work out 
details of an agreement settling a lawsuit over the safety of the 
offroad machines 
James Lacy general counsel of the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission said Wednesday that the court has been asked to extend 
the effective date of the agreement to March 7 
Everything is moving along fine we just needed additional 
time to work out technicalities Lacy said 
Announced Dec 30 the agreement was originally scheduled to 
take effect after 45 days the middle of this month 
The agreement was worked out by the Commission the Justice 
Department and the makers of ATVs principally Honda Yamaha 
Suzuki and Kawasaki 
It calls for an end to sales of threewheel ATVs those most 
often blamed for the accidents which have claimed more than 900 
lives and 7000 injuries in the last five years Manufacturers are 
switching to fourwheel versions of the machines 
In addition the agreement would provide for free safety training 
for riders improved warning labels on machines and for the makers 
to refrain from marketing to people aged 16 and under 
Consumer groups have been critical of the settlement contending 
that the threewheeled ATVs should have been recalled for safety 
reasons
