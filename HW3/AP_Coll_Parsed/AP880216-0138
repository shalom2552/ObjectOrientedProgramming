The Cabinet on Tuesday approved an ordinance that 
will give government employees a taste of the fiveday workweek 
Beginning in April about 11 million public sector workers will 
alternate between the new system and the old one of sixday 
workweeks said Katsunari Miyoshi of the Management and 
Coordination Agency 
The new system will give workers two fiveday weeks and two 
sixday weeks each month 
The Cabinet move came more than six years after the fiveday 
system was started on a trial basis in November 1981 Miyoshi said 
Japans trading partners including the United States have 
called for shorter working hours for Japanese workers Increased 
leisure time translates into greater spending which helps boost 
Japans domestic consumption and correct its trade imbalances 
In the private sector 509 percent of Japanese companies with a 
workforce of 30 or more currently operate on a fiveday workweek 
according to a Labor Ministry survey
