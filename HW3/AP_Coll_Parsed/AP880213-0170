An underground nuclear weapons test will 
be conducted Monday at the Nevada Test Site and may produce 
offsite ground motion a Department of Energy spokeswoman said

The test code named Kernville is the first announced test of 
1988 and will range between 20 and 150 kilotons in size department 
spokeswoman Barbara Yoerg said It is scheduled for 830 am 
Monday 
Because of the size of the test there is a chance there will 
be ground motion off the test site Managers of tall buildings 
should be aware this is going to happen Ms Yoerg said 
The test could be delayed for a variety of reasons including 
weather which does not look great she said 
The blast will be conducted 1800 feet below Pahute Mesa about 
105 miles northwest of Las Vegas 
The test is weaponsrelated and sponsored by Livermore National 
Laboratory Ms Yoerg said
