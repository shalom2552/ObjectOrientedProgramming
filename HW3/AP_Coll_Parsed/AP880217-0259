Chrysler Corp said it has raised prices on its 
imported Mitsubishi Motors Corp cars an average 46 percent over 
comparably equipped 1987 models 
The new prices announced Tuesday also were higher in most 
cases than tentative prices used since the model year began in 
October said Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart 
The increases followed a debate between Chrysler and various 
Japanese automakers in which Chrysler charged the Japanese 
companies may be dumping cars and trucks on the US market 
Dumping is selling foreign products here for less than in their 
home market 
Chrysler has maintained the Japanese companies probably havent 
increased prices enough to reflect the dramatic jump in the value 
of the Japanese yen against the dollar in the past two years 
The dumping debate heated up at news conferences preceding last 
weekends opening of the Chicago Auto Show where Chrysler also 
introduced a new Japanese car the Mitsubishibuilt Eagle Summit 
for its JeepEagle lineup 
Toyota Motor Sales USA Vice President Robert McCurry charged 
that if the Japanese were dumping so were the US automakers who 
sell imported Japanese cars under their own nameplates 
Of the Big Three US automakers Chrysler is the most dependent 
on Japanese imports About 11 percent of its cars and 40 percent of 
its light trucks are built by Mitsubishi in Japan 
McCurry also said Chrysler Ford Motor Co and General Motors 
Corp were charging less for imported Japanese cars sold under 
American nameplates than were Japanese companies who made the cars 
At the prices announced Tuesday a base Plymouth Colt twodoor 
hatchback will start at 5998 down from 6005 for a comparable 
1987 model and up from the tentative 1988 price of 5899 
At the other extreme the base price on the sporty Chrysler 
Conquest TSi coupe rose to 18683 from 18005 on a comparable 
1987 model and up from the tentative 1988 price of 18155 Stewart 
said 
Chris Cedergren industry analyst with JD Power and Associates 
in Agoura Calif said Japanese automakers have held down prices 
on their entrylevel cars and made up the difference on 
higherpriced models 
Automakers value entrylevel buyers because of the chance they 
will become loyal customers and buy more expensive cars from the 
same company later
