An engineer accused of running a stop signal 
and driving three freight locomotives into the path of a speeding 
passenger train pleaded guilty today to one count of manslaughter 
in Amtraks deadliest crash ever 
The state agreed to drop 15 other manslaughter counts against 
former Conrail engineer Rick L Gates in the Jan 4 1987 crash 
Baltimore County States Attorney Sandra OConnor told Circuit 
Court Judge Joseph F Murphy 
The crash killed 16 people and injured more than 170 others The 
names of the other 15 victims will be added to the single count of 
manslaughter by locomotive 
The agreement was announced as jury selection for Gates trial 
was to begin Mrs OConnor said the state has reserved the right 
to ask for the maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a 
1000 fine Sentencing was set for March 29 
Gates was operating three Conrail locomotives that prosecutors 
say ran the stop signal in Chase and wound up in front of an 
Amtrak train traveling about 120 mph 
After the hearing Gates told reporters outside the courthouse 
I am ultimately responsible for the crash and for my negligence 
I cant begin to imagine the pain and grief of the families I 
am sorry he said 
According to the statement of facts read in court today the 
signals told Gates to slow the locomotives to 30 mph and then to 
stop before reaching the switch 
The statement said that former Conrail brakeman Edward Cromwell 
would have testified that he smoked a marijuana cigarette with 
Gates in the train cab However experts could not agree whether 
the marijuana would have impaired Gates performance said the 
statement agreed to by both sides 
The summary also said Gates failed to correct five safety 
violations before he took the locomotives out of the Conrail yard 
for the trip to Harrisburg Pa including a failure to have a 
working whistle and speed warning light and adequate train radio 
Susan Horn whose daughter Ceres Millicent Horn was killed in 
the crash cried and shook her head as the 48page statement was 
read 
Federal investigators have said Gates 33 of Essex failed to 
notice the stop signals because of marijuana and possibly alcohol 
use Gates has denied smoking marijuana while operating the train 
Testimony had been expected to focus on drug use warning 
whistles and lights in the locomotive cab and a series of approach 
signals to the switch where four tracks converge to two at the 
Gunpowder River railroad bridge 
Cromwell has been granted immunity and had been expected to 
testify that he and Gates fabricated a story to cover up their 
marijuana smoking on the train 
Chief Public Defender Donna Shearer said that defense attorneys 
will try to discredit Cromwell by pointing out that he ran from the 
scene while Gates stayed to help save lives 
Gates attorneys said they will present evidence that the track 
signals often malfunction contrary to official statements 
The county grand jurys indictment announced May 4 accused Gates 
of gross negligence 
Gates who worked for Conrail for 14 years has said signals 
indicated he should slow down and proceed through the switch 
But the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that 
Gates failed to notice track signals or emergency warnings in the 
cab because he was impaired by marijuana and possibly alcohol 
Blood tests taken immediately after the accident showed Gates and 
Cromwell had traces of marijuana in their bodies but a recent 
court ruling in a different case could have hampered use of this 
evidence by prosecutors 
The men were tested under a Federal Railroad Administration rule 
requiring urine or blood samples of any worker involved in a 
serious accident but the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco ruled last week that such tests are unconstitutional 
The railroad administration has said it will appeal and the 
rulings effect on the trial remains uncertain It stands as 
official precedent only in the circuit courts area which does not 
include Maryland but may affect judicial thinking elsewhere 
Even if the evidence had been allowed prosecutors would have 
had to prove Gates was impaired by the drugs not just that he was 
using them 
The trial could have implications for government control over 
train operators and for more than 294 million in civil suits 
arising from the crash The railroad administration has said the 
crash already has helped it in its battle for federal control over 
licensing and training of engineers 
The federal government had no authority to punish Gates or 
Cromwell both of whom resigned from Conrail
