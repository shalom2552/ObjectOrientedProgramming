Poor management an inability to cooperate and a 
preoccupation with shortterm profits are among reasons American 
business is losing ground to foreign competitors says the first 
report of the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity 
The US economy is still the most productive in the world but 
could be surpassed by other nations that are gaining on it the 
commission reported Monday at the annual meeting of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science 
We are talking about keeping the standard of living in the 
United States and enhancing it said Michael L Dertouzos 
director of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and chairman of the 
commission In that sense we think productivity is important 
The commission was appointed in December 1986 by MIT President 
Paul E Gray Its 18 MIT scientists engineers political 
scientists and economists including Robert Solow last years 
winner of the Nobel Prize in economics were asked to determine 
the causes of the weakness in US productivity and to make 
recommendations to industry universities and government concerning 
what might be done to correct it 
In its interim report Monday the commission listed what it 
believes to be the five principal causes of the decline in American 
productivity 
They are 
Excessive attention to activities and investments that are 
profitable in the short run America invented the transistor radio 
color television and the video cassette recorder Dertouzos said 
American businesses quickly lost interest in producing them 
however and lost those markets to Japan 
Parochial attitudes that led American businesses to pay 
insufficient attention to foreign competitors In the machinetool 
industry American firms tried to backlog orders rather than 
aggressively deliver products on time Japanese firms promised 
quicker delivery and captured much of the market Dertouzos said 
A lack of cooperation within firms among competing firms and 
between firms and their suppliers One reason that Japanese 
automakers can bring new cars to market faster than those in the 
United States is that Japanese designers and production engineers 
work together more closely than their American counterparts 
Dertouzos said 
Thats endemic to our educational system said Lester 
Thurow a commission member and the dean of the MIT Sloan School of 
Management We throw you out of school if you cooperate on an 
exam its called cheating 
Weaknesses in human resource management The worker is 
viewed as a cost factor to be minimized rather than as an evolving 
human resource that has to be educated motivated Dertouzos said 
Failures in applying technology to make simple reliable 
highquality products In the case of VCRs the Americans who 
invented them couldnt develop production lines that would meet the 
close tolerances necessary and would do so at an acceptable cost 
Dertouzos said 
Thurow said the United States clings to certain practices that 
might have served us in the past when our economy was far ahead of 
everyone elses but are not serving us well now 
The United States is the easiest country in the world to hire 
and fire people he said It is the only industrialized country 
where people can be fired at will he said In France to take one 
other example workers must be given one years notice before they 
are dropped Thurow said 
While the ability to fire workers might seem efficient in the 
shortterm it provides powerful incentive for workers to sabotage 
innovative technology that might cost them their jobs Thurow said 
Solow said that the comparatively high cost of borrowing money 
in the United States compared with Japan makes it more difficult 
for American firms to profit from longterm investments
