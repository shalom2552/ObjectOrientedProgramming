Thousands of people weary of the cold snowy 
Minnesota winter put on shorts kicked off their shoes and went 
barefoot at the beach inside the Metrodome 
Barefoot children built sand castles in more than 400 tons of 
sand that was dumped on the stadiums floor Saturday as part of 
Beach Break billed as Minnesotas midwinter beach party 
We couldnt get to Orlando this year so this is our 
secondbest bet said Alan Frailich of New Hope who was with his 
wife Yvonne and their three children We deserve it 
Of course it didnt matter that the grass was artificial turf 
that the palm trees were plastic and that the ocean view was only a 
painted backdrop 
It didnt matter because high temperatures over the past week 
were mostly in single digits with overnight lows below zero and 
several inches of snow cover the ground in most places around the 
metropolitan area 
The dome took on a carnival atmosphere complete with Ferris 
wheel merrygoround 75foot highdiving platform music stage 
volleyball courts reggae bands and simulated windsurfing in front 
of a powerful fan 
Among the people wearing shorts were Jan and Bob Riese of 
Fridley who took photos they intend to send to friends in Florida 
Its not quite as good as being there but its a lot 
cheaper she said Were having a ball
