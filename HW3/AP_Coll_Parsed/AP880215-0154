The United States has told the Soviet Union 
that verification procedures worked out for mediumrange missiles 
will not suffice for the strategic arms talks that begin again this 
week senior arms control adviser Edward L Rowny said Monday 
We are calling for tough measures which will assure that we 
can verify Soviet compliance Rowny told the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science in Boston The text of the speech 
was released in Washington 
The Soviets he said can expedite progress on strategic arms 
reductions by abandoning their effort to link the reductions to 
Americas pursuit of Star Wars technology 
Rowny accused the Soviets of delaying tactics which he said are 
jeopardizing reaching an agreement on strategic arms in time for 
President Reagans meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev 
in late spring or early summer 
They appear to believe delaying tactics will reward them with 
a START treaty imbalanced in their favor Rowny said I hope 
they will recognize that their intransigence is only dimming hopes 
for an agreement before the Moscow summit meeting 
Even with the tough verification procedures approved two months 
ago as part of the treaty banning mediumrange missile Rowny said 
it would be misleading to suggest we are on a roll toward a START 
agreement 
We are concerned that the Soviets heavy reliance on very 
large ICBMs may give them a sense of confidence that they could 
gain a critical advantage by striking first Rowny said 
By seeking a limit that permanently reduces both the number and 
the proportion of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the Soviet 
armory he said we are asking the Soviets in effect to renounce 
any motion that nuclear war is winnable even if initiated 
preemptively
