As part of an unusual Valentines Day 
project about 350 students at two high schools have agreed to give 
up or not start smoking or dipping snuff 
The American Heart Association and the Texas Association of 
Student Councils organized the project called Save a Sweet 
Heart to make students aware of how cigarettes can affect their 
hearts 
About 250 students at West Brook Senior High and 96 at the 
Central High School ninthgrade campus signed the pledges on Friday 
The students themselves worked on promoting the day and 
gathering pledges The program is similar to the annual Great 
American Smokeout that takes place in the fall
