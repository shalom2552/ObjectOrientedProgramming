Past glories and future dreams of this 
economically depressed mining town two miles up in the Rocky 
Mountains are pinned to a bill now inching its way through Congress 
The measure aims to bless the National Mining Hall of Fame and 
Museum now housed in the old Lake County junior high school here 
in Leadville with a federal charter 
Such a charter brings no bucks but would qualify the museum for 
inclusion on lists of national historical sites and maps and other 
official documents and museum boosters believe that will lure 
thousands of mining buffs 
Tourist dollars are badly needed in Lake County where 
unemployment stands at 22 percent the highest in Colorado The 
states average unemployment rate was 64 percent in October the 
last month tallied 
Leadville is the highest town in North America and an historic 
mother lode of legends and lore from the bygone silver and gold 
rush days 
We think having the hall of fame and mining museum will 
provide a cornerstone for revitalizing Leadville said state Rep 
Ken Chlouber We may be one of the richest six cubic miles on 
Earth because of our minerals but we have to diversify 
Fiftyfour mining museums are scattered around the country 
according to the industry They range from oneroom displays to the 
new 11 million New Mexico Museum of Mining at Grants which 
spotlights uranium the World Museum of Mining in Butte Mont 
which showcases copper the American Mining Hall of Fame in Tucson 
Ariz and an exhibition coal mine at Beckley WVa 
But none claims a national designation say backers who want The 
National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum to become an educational 
center for the entire industry 
The museum set up as a nonprofit corporation was chartered by 
Colorado in 1977 and has members in 31 states Industry giants such 
as AMAX Phelps Dodge Corp and ASARCO support the idea and many 
mining executives serve on the board of trustees 
Bills designating the Leadville site as the nations official 
mining museum were introduced in Congress a year ago 
On Feb 4 the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved 
one version and sent it to the full Senate with 40 cosponsors 
An identical resolution is stalled in the House with only half 
the 218 cosponsors required to move it through the legislative 
process 
Museum advocates are chomping at the bit counting on the 
federal charter to help them raise 15 million to construct 
initial exhibits 
For more than a century Leadville has been synonymous with 
mining In the 1800s thousands of adventurers dug gold and silver 
found in the towns namesake veins of lead from surrounding 
mountains 
Legendary characters such as gambler and gunfighter Doc 
Holliday suffragette Susan B Anthony the unsinkable Molly 
Brown and English writer Oscar Wilde were attracted to the boom 
town 100 miles west of Denver then a nondescript little frontier 
settlement 
In this century Leadvilles soughtafter metal was molybdenum 
used to strengthen steel AMAXs Climax mine north of town which 
provided steady paychecks through two world wars and the Great 
Depression employed 3200 people in 1981 
But Leadvilles mining collapsed in 1982 because of declining 
steelmaking and a world molybdenum glut Climax now keeps just 48 
men on a skeleton maintenance force 
Town leaders accustomed to Leadvilles boombust history at 
first didnt believe largescale commercial mining was finished 
But as Lake Countys unemployment soared and For Sale signs 
sprouted like weeds committees were formed to plot economic 
strategy 
Leadville is 60 miles east of Aspen 40 miles south of Vail and 
surrounded by some of the nations most spectacular scenery 
including two of Colorados highest peaks Mount Elbert and Mount 
Massive 
One campaign that fizzled over time was Operation Bootstrap 
aimed at coaxing more tourists to the town of 3300 people half 
the countys population 
The National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum was nothing but an 
idea looking for a home when a search committee received 
Leadvilles application in 1986 
We heard there was a national competition for the mining 
museum and this community went after it said Chlouber That 
effort marked the first time everybody in this town really came 
together and forgot about their little turf battles 
Being out of work will do that to you said Chlouber a 
former shift boss at the Climax mine but now unemployed except for 
his legislative job which pays just 11500 a year When were 
all unemployed we support each other 
To lure the museum the school board offered the old junior high 
and its 71000 square feet of space for 50 cents rent a year The 
county donated parking and free utilities for two years The town 
offered office space snow removal and improved traffic routing 
Colorado Mountain College volunteered to make promotional films 
supply audiovisual help for exhibits and lend its local campus for 
mining seminars 
We need this museum said Carol Luoma who owns the Golden 
Burro Restaurant with her husband Jack Both lost their jobs when 
the Climax mine closed They gambled their life savings to buy the 
cafe on Leadvilles main street 
Weve got to all pull together to bring new businesses and 
attractions here This is a great place to live full of wonderful 
people and I hate to see many of them leaving because there arent 
any jobs said Mrs Luoma The museum can be our showpiece and 
help make Leadville famous again 
Robert Reeder the museums executive director said the 
Victorianstyle junior high building would eventually be converted 
to house a library geology hall lecture auditorium and rooms 
detailing the history of American mining The Hall of Fame plans to 
periodically pick a person whos made a major contribution to 
mining 
We want to show visitors theres virtually nothing you can 
look at that mining doesnt have some impact on said Reeder 
Did you know 17 minerals go into making newsprint That 14 
minerals are needed to manufacture basic cosmetics 
College enrollment in mining engineering is down in this 
country from 4000 students in 1977 to 616 this academic year 
said Reeder We want this museum and hall of fame to stimulate 
peoples awareness of how important this industry is both its 
past its present and its future
