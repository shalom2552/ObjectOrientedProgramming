A convicted Italian terrorist who was 
released from prison when Greece refused to extradite him to Italy 
has applied for residency in Greece his lawyer said 
Maurizio Folini 34 a member of the Red Brigades organization 
was freed Tuesday after Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas 
overturned a Supreme Court extradition decision 
We went and applied for permission and I am sure it will be 
granted After he gets a residence permit we will ask for political 
asylum Folinis lawyer Nikos Constantopoulos told The 
Associated Press on Wednesday 
Koutsogiorgas said Folini was released because many of his 
punishable offenses have either been written off or are not 
punishable under Greek law 
Others refer to the fact that Folini tried to violently 
overthrow the economic and social institutions of the Italian 
state That is to say offenses that were clearly political 
Koutsogiorgas said 
Folini was convicted in absentia by an Italian court in 1986 on 
terrorism charges He was arrested in Athens on June 22 1987 
after entering Greece on a false passport Italian authorities 
immediately asked for his extradition 
Last September the Greek Supreme Court upheld a lower court 
decision ruling that Folini should be extradited But he had 
remained in jail in Athens pending Justice Ministry confirmation of 
the decision
