Last week the political spotlight was on a 
farm state whose economy has fared poorly during the Reagan years 
Now it turns to a New England state that has been booming 
Political analysts say economic circumstances may have a bigger 
impact on the New Hampshire primary than any momentum from the Feb 
8 caucuses in Iowa where Democrat Richard Gephardt and Republican 
Bob Dole came in first with Vice President George Bush falling 
back to third place behind Pat Robertson on the GOP side 
Iowa was a state that voted for change says William 
Schneider a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute The 
status quo candidates were Bush and Dukakis and they both did 
fairly or very poorly 
The Reagan legacy and the Massachusetts miracle didnt sell in 
Iowa Schneider said But New Hampshire is at the other 
extreme with the lowest unemployment rate in the country and a 
boom economy The status quo is much more popular 
Schneider said exit polling in Iowa by the Los Angeles Times 
showed the more dissatisfied you were with the way things were 
going the more you voted for Dole or Robertson on the Republican 
side if you were realy unhappy you voted for Robertson and for 
Gephardt on the Democratic side 
Kevin Phillips a Republican analyst agreed that Iowa was a 
considerable portrait of discontent 
Bushs screaming onefifth of the vote was the only vote that 
you could really read as support of the president Thats pretty 
low for an incumbent vice president said Phillips 
On the Democratic side its pretty clear that Gephardt and 
Simon and Jackson did better than early expectations The guy who 
ran a little bit behind early expectations was Mr New England Good 
News the man with the purring economy whose message is for the 
yuppies Dukakis said Phillips 
In New Hampshire what Dukakis has to worry about is falling 
short of expectations like Muskie in 1972 he added 
Stu Eizenstat a top policy adviser in the Carter 
administration predicted that the combined Iowa and New Hampshire 
results may only show the strength of regional candidates 
Midwesterners Gephardt and Simon in the Midwest New Englander 
Dukakis in New England 
If Al Gore and Jesse Jackson the two Democrats with the 
strongest Southern ties emerge as the big winners on Super 
Tuesday then the Democrats may be left with no one candidate 
showing a national base and strength 
Well have sorted out regional candidates with no base 
anywhere Eizenstat said
