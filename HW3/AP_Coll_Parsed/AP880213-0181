Upcoming USSoviet negotiations on nuclear 
testing are expected to finalize a plan on joint test blasts to be 
held in both countries by June a Soviet envoy said Saturday 
In a related development The New York Times reported that 
Moscow wants limits on sealaunched nonnuclear cruise missiles a 
move that appeared to toughen the Soviet position at the arms talks 
Igor Palenykh Moscows chief delegate said the test blasts 
will help the two sides reach agreement preferably in the first 
half of 1988 on anticheating measures intended to lead to the 
ratification of two 1970s superpower treaties limiting the power of 
test blasts 
Palenykh said that after ratification on the 1970s test ban 
treaties both sides should proceed to limit and ultimately ban 
nuclear tests 
He spoke to reporters at Geneva airport after arriving for a 
second round of nuclear talks to begin Monday 
In the first round of talks in November US and Soviet 
negotiations reached basic agreement to demonstrate technology for 
detecting blast yields during experiments at the main US and 
Soviet test ranges 
The second round is expected to set the dates and settle all 
questions of the preparation and conduct of the joint tests 
Palenykh said 
In January teams of US and Soviet scientists made fiveday 
inspection tours of the Soviet test range at Semipalatinsk and the 
US site in the Nevada desert 
The Times in its Sunday editions said the Reagan 
administration officials thought the two sides agreed during the 
December summit meeting in Washington that cruise missiles carrying 
conventional warheads will not be covered by a new strategic arms 
treaty 
The Soviets are asking that the number of the longrange 
sealaunched weapons armed with conventional warheads be limited to 
600 the newspaper reported 
It said the Soviet proposal calls for a limit of 400 
nucleararmed sealaunched cruise missiles for a total limit of 
1000 of the guided longrange subsonic weapons 
The United States which is planning to have 2643 
conventionally armed cruise missiles for use at sea opposes the 
inclusion of such missiles in a new treaty arguing they are needed 
to improve the United States capability to fight without nuclear 
weapons the Times said 
The Times said some experts speculate that the Soviet Union 
wants a cap on the total number of sealaunched cruise missiles 
because it is difficult to distinguish between cruise missiles 
armed with nuclear and nonnuclear warheads
