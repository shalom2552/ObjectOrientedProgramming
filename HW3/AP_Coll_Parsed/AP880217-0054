After months of debate the US Energy 
Department has decided not to restart the flawed and aging N 
Reactor one of four reactors supplying the US nuclear arsenal 
with bombgrade plutonium 
The N reactor has been closed since January 1987 for about 70 
million worth of safety improvements prompted by the nuclear 
disaster that killed 31 people at the similarly designed Soviet 
nuclear plant at Chernobyl 
Energy Secretary John Herrington announced Tuesday the reactor 
at the Hanford nuclear reservation will be placed on cold 
standby status forcing about 2600 workers to be laid off in the 
next two years 
This decision signals the end of the plutonium production 
mission at the Hanford site said Mike Lawrence Hanford 
operations manager for the Energy Department 
Plans for the mothballing of the reactor will be included in the 
Reagan administrations proposed budget that will be sent to 
Congress Thursday 
A report prepared last year for the Energy Department projected 
that a gradual phaseout of plutoniumproducing operations at 
Hanford by 1996 would result in the loss of more than 13800 jobs 
in the state 
Gov Booth Gardner and members of the states congressional 
delegation pledged to seek a way to cushion the economic shock 
But Sen Dan Evans RWash said Frankly the most likely 
type of aid to come will be unemployment benefits 
Herrington said the decision to mothball the reactor was based 
on a secret Department of Defense review of the nations future 
need for plutonium a key ingredient in nuclear weapons 
The Energy Department said demand for plutonium could be met by 
three reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken SC and 
through plutonium recovery from nuclear weapons retired as a result 
of the recent USSoviet treaty 
The Savannah River reactors are running at 50 percent power 
because of safety concerns 
The N Reactor operated for the Energy Department by 
Westinghouse Inc shares several design characteristics with the 
Chernobyl plant including graphite in the reactor core to moderate 
nuclear fission and lack of a containment dome 
US officials say the N Reactor operated for the Energy 
Department by Westinghouse Inc was considerably safer than the 
one at Chernobyl 
The fate of the reactor the last of nine plutonium producers 
that have operated at Hanford since 1944 had been mired in 
controversy Proponents said the nation needed the plutonium while 
opponents contended it did not and that the reactor was unsafe 
The cold standby status will begin next year shortly after 
the safety improvements are completed and tested The reactor could 
be restarted but that would take up to three years Lawrence said 
The N reactor employs 3300 of Hanfords 14000 workers The 
site is the biggest employer in the nearby cities of Richland 
Kennewick and Pasco which have a combined population of about 
130000 
State agencies will do everything they can to help those who 
will be affected by the shutdown Gardner said 
Rep Don Bonker said he and Sen Brock Adams both Democrats 
planned to introduce a military waste cleanup bill that we hope 
will provide thousands of highskilled jobs 
Over 40 years of defense wastes are temporarily stored in tanks 
at the site Under cold standby status fuel will be removed from 
the reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued the 
Energy Department said 
Related plutonium processing plants which employ more than 
3000 Hanford workers will be gradually phased out in the 1990s as 
the stockpiled plutonium is exhausted Lawrence said 
The decision to close the reactor ended a period of uncertainty 
for local officials and plant workers 
Im just glad that we finally know what the decision is 
said Richland Mayor John Poynor Well survive this and come out 
stronger for it 
The reality of it hasnt hit home yet said Stan Waggoner 
an N Reactor technician who learned of the decision as he came off 
the afternoon shift Tuesday 
Hanford was built in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project to 
produce atomic bombs The N Reactor began operations in 1963 
At more than 4000 megawatts of thermal power the N Reactor has 
the highest operating power of any US reactor
