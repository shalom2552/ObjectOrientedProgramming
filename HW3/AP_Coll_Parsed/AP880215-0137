The first announced nuclear weapon test 
of 1988 rocked the Nevada desert Monday and sent a shudder through 
some highrise buildings in Las Vegas 105 miles from ground zero 
The device produced an explosive punch up to 11 times as 
powerful as the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima 
The test was conducted three weeks after a team of Soviet 
nuclear scientists visited the top secret Nevada Test Site a 
visit that could lead to the monitoring of each others tests and a 
possible test ban 
And it came the same day the second round of USSoviet 
negotiations on nuclear testing began in Geneva with the Soviets 
calling for agreement by June on anticheating provisions That 
would permit ratification of two superpower treaties limiting the 
yield of test blasts 
The test code named Kernville was delayed two hours because of 
unfavorable wind conditions then another 10 minutes because of 
technical problems according to Department of Energy spokeswoman 
Barbara Yoerg 
The experiment was buried 1800 feet below the surface of Pahute 
Mesa about 105 miles northwest of Las Vegas 
Managers of tall buildings in Las Vegas were warned in advance 
not to have workers in precarious positions at the time of the 
blast a standard warning when tests are close to the upper test 
limit of 150 kilotons of explosive force 
Motion was recorded on DOE seismographs at the Riviera Hotel on 
the Las Vegas Strip the Regency Towers Apartments here and 
Scottys Castle in Death Valley Calif southwest of the test site 
A telephone operator at the highrise Fitzgerald Hotel in 
downtown Las Vegas said hanging plants swayed in the seconds after 
the 1010 am PST detonation But a controller at McCarran 
International Airport control tower reported feeling no motion 
Ms Yoerg said she felt no ground motion at the control point 
41 miles from ground zero 
The blast measured 54 on the Richter scale of ground motion at 
the National Earthquake Information Center Golden Colo 
Everything was fully contained That makes it a successful 
test she said 
Ms Yoerg said the test was weaponsrelated and sponsored by 
Livermore National Laboratory in California 
It brought to 675 the total number of announced blasts at the 
Nevada Test Site since testing began there in 1951 It was the 
470th test announced by the United States since the limited test 
ban treaty of August 1963 she said 
The most recent previous test was Mission Cyber fired on Dec 
2 1987 There were 15 announced tests last year and 12 announced 
tests in 1986 Not all tests are announced for security reasons 
the DOE says
