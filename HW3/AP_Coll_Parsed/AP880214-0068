Three PLO members were killed Sunday 
when a bomb ripped through the car they were driving to lunch 
authorities said 
The wife of one of the three men saw the blast as she stood on a 
nearby balcony cradling a baby said staterun Cyprus radio 
Police in this southern port city said the bomb went off around 
noon killing the three instantly and destroying the automobile 
The official Cyprus News Agency said it received an anonymous 
phone call from a man who said the killing was carried out by the 
Group of Martyrs of Lt Col Rassem elGhoul Officials said they 
had never heard of the group 
The caller speaking in broken English accused the slain 
Palestinians of having been involved in the fatal shooting of 
elGhoul a top commando in Force 17 
Force 17 is the elite security apparatus of Fatah PLO chief 
Yasser Arafats guerrilla faction PLO officials had said the three 
killed in the blast were officers in Fatah There was no immediate 
PLO comment on the claim of responsibility 
ElGhoul the Force 17 area commander in Sidon southern 
Lebanon was kidnapped in August last year His body was found two 
days later but the motive for the slaying was never established 
An Associated Press photographer who visited the scene of the 
blast said the cars roof was blown off the vehicle was wrecked 
and two of the bodies were blown 60 feet from the car 
In Athens Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman Bassam 
Abu Sharif accused Israel of being behind the slayings 
Sharif linked the deaths to Israeli attempts to stop a ship 
filled with 133 Palestinian deportees from sailing from Greece to 
Israel 
Israel started this open war after losing the secret war 
concerning the ship he said The PLO has accused Israel of 
waging a secret war to prevent the voyage It now says the 
vessel will sail on Monday 
There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials 
In a later news conference Abu Sharif backed off from his 
earlier claim that the attack was linked to Israeli frustration 
over failing to stop the boat But he called it clear proof 
that the Israelis continue their terrorism not only against our 
population in the West Bank and Gaza but also elsewhere 
He was referring to more than two months of violence that has 
rocked the Israelioccupied territories 
The director of the PLO office in Nicosia Samir Abu Ghazale 
identified the victims as Mohammed Sultan Mohammed Buheis also 
known as Abu Hassan Kassem and Marwan Kayyali 
Kayyali was also a member of the PLOs military council Sultan 
was in his early 40s the other two in their late 20s 
Ghazale said Sultan had Lebanese nationality Buheis traveled 
under another name with a North Yemeni passport and Kayyali had a 
Moroccan passport He did not have details of the mens precise 
functions in the PLO 
Police said they did not believe that the blast was not 
connected with presidential elections being held in the Greek 
Cypriot sector of this Mediterranean island on Sunday 
Police said the explosion did not disrupt the voting in 
Limassol the islands second largest city with a population of 
121000 
Ghazale said the three were on their way to lunch when the bomb 
exploded Eyewitnesses gave a similar account 
That differed from the original police account which said the 
car apparently was parked at the time of the blast The 
discrepancies could not immediately be reconciled 
A sizable number of Arabs mainly Lebanese and Palestinians 
live in Limassol 
The PLO is an umbrella organization for eight guerrilla factions 
who are the Palestinians military arm The main group is Arafats 
Fatah which has an estimated 8000 guerrillas most of them in 
Lebanon
