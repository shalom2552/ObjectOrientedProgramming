An airport restaurant employee who says he was 
fired for not charging Mayor Eugene Sawyer for a 495 beef 
sandwich may soon find himself working for the city of Chicago 
Sawyer upon hearing about the dismissal of Michael Bueschel 
indicated late Friday that the 23yearold college student could 
end up with a job working for him 
Ill help him find one said Sawyer who ate the sandwich on 
his way to a speaking engagement in Alabama on Thursday If he 
cant find one for him Ill give him one myself 
Bueschel a sophomore at Richard J Daley College who has been 
working his way through college said he thought all along the 
mayor would sympathize with his plight 
Hes a very fair person and Id be more than honored to work 
with him if he deems it necessary he said I had a feeling the 
mayor would really take care of me 
Bueschel said he was fired for misappropriation of company 
funds from a 5anhour restaurant job with Midway Airport 
Restaurant Inc upon reporting to work at the Cafe Volare on Friday 
afternoon 
I was informed I had been terminated because I didnt receive 
permission to give a sandwich to the mayor of the fine city of 
Chicago Bueschel said 
Generally I would give a public official like that a 
complimentary meal to keep up public relations 
Restaurant manager Michael Oswald told The Associated Press 
Friday he would have no comment
