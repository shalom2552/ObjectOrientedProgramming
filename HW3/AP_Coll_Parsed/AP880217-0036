A woman seeking psychiatric help in a hospital 
emergency room suddenly shot a social worker to death with a 
handgun and held three people hostage before surrendering Tuesday 
night police said 
Edith Anderson 31 of suburban Rankin was arrested on homicide 
and related charges in St Francis Medical Center in the citys 
Bloomfield neighborhood at about 1015 pm according to police 
Cmdr Ron Freeman 
Ms Anderson apparently was sitting with hospital caseworker 
Linda Rosen 27 of Pittsburgh in the psychiatric waiting area of 
the emergency room at about 855 pm when she shot Miss Rosen 
without warning according to police and to hospital spokeswoman 
Shirley Freyer 
The social worker was talking to this woman and there 
didnt seem to be any conflict and a security guard turned around 
and heard four gunshots Mrs Freyer said They were sitting I 
assume side by side 
After the shooting Ms Anderson took two women and a man 
hostage and held them for more than an hour before they were 
released unharmed police said The hostages who were not 
identified were waiting at the emergency room for a relative who 
was being treated police said 
Everyone else in the emergency room was evacuated The people 
who were being seen in treatment rooms were taken out Mrs 
Freyer said 
Freeman said Ms Anderson came to the hospital by herself 
seeking psychiatric care 
Police Chief Ralph Pampena said four to six shots were fired 
After that he said Ms Anderson went into a restroom and 
pointed a handgun through a slightly opened door at the people 
seated nearby ordering them not to move 
Police entered the emergency room and began talking to Ms 
Anderson in the bathroom who allowed them to remove the wounded 
caseworker Pampena said Miss Rosen died before getting medical 
treatment he said 
Pampena said Ms Anderson first let one of the three hostages go 
free then asked to talk to Eddie Edwards a popular local 
television talk show host When Edwards arrived the woman freed 
the other two hostages police said Officers then managed to 
distract her enough to be able to close the restroom door on her 
and eventually persuaded her to surrender 
Police said the woman was being questioned by homicide 
detectives during the night No time had been set for an 
arraignment and bail hearing
