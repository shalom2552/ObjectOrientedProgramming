Supporters call him in English The MAN 
a takeoff on his initials Critics call him in Spanish Cara de 
Pina or Pineapple Face because of his pocked and jowly 
visage 
The United States calls him a fugitive from justice a man who 
put himself and his country up for sale to drug traffickers and 
made millions of dollars in the process 
But few would deny that Gen Manuel Antonio Noriega is a shrewd 
wily and tough politician who will not easily be dislodged as the 
de facto ruler of Panama 
He is sly enough suggest several US senators to have conned 
the United States government into supporting him for years despite 
longstanding rumors of his involvement in drug smuggling election 
fraud and other corruption 
Washington began to distance itself from Noriega only after the 
headless body of one of his leading opponents Hugo Spadafora 
turned up in a US mailbag in Costa Rica in late 1985 Several 
former associates say Noriega ordered the slaying after Spadafora 
publicly accused him of drug trafficking 
Indictments returned by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa 
Fla on Feb 5 accuse Noriega of using his position as the 
commander of Panamas Defense Forces to allow Colombian drug 
traffickers to use his country as a base for smuggling cocaine and 
marijuana into the United States 
Noriega the indictments say got a healthy kickback from the 
narcotics profits They put his take at up to 48 million 
By any account Noriega has done well for someone born into 
poverty in a relatively poor country and raised by foster parents 
from the age of 5 
Details of Noriegas early life are scarce and even his birthday 
is in dispute His official biography lists his age as 50 but high 
school records put it at 54 
After attending a military college in Peru on a scholarship 
Noriega entered the Panamanian National Guard in 1962 as a 
lieutenant He quickly became acquainted with a rising young 
officer named Omar Torrijos 
Torrijos took power in Panama in a 1968 coup and less than a 
year later named Noriega then an obscure major in charge of the 
countrys northernmost province as his chief of intelligence with 
the rank of lieutenant colonel 
In his new position Noriega began collecting dossiers on 
everyone who counted in Panama friends and enemies alike He also 
had jurisdiction over the countrys customs and immigration 
departments long a source of funds for the military 
The job also put Noriega in touch with US intelligence 
agencies interested in any potential threats to the security of the 
Panama Canal a vital shipping link between the Atlantic and 
Pacific oceans 
When Torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981 
Noriega was well placed to shoulder his way to the top command 
ahead of several more senior officers It took him two years 
In addition to drug smuggling Noriega is reputed to have his 
finger in a wide variety of other enterprises some legal and 
others operating on the fringes of the law They are said to 
include duty free liquor stores maritime services banks gambling 
casinos newspapers a television station and 12 radio stations 
Although his official salary is 60000 a year Noriega lives in 
a twostory colonialstyle mansion in one of Panama Citys most 
exclusive neighborhoods maintains a fleet of expensive cars and is 
reported to own at least a dozen other properties including an 
apartment in Paris and a chateau in the south of France
