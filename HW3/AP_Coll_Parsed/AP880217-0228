The Iowa Supreme Court ruled Wednesday 
that courts have the power to order sterilization of the mentally 
retarded but declined to spell out guidelines for deciding when it 
is appropriate 
A dissenting justice said the court was walking into a legal 
morass 
In a narrowly drawn opinion seven justices agreed that courts 
can act on a request that retarded people be sterilized even though 
a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977 
We conclude that our district courts possess subject matter 
jurisdiction over and accordingly may hear and determine 
applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentally 
incapacitated ward such as that involved here the high court 
said in an opinion written by Justice Bruce Snell 
In his dissent Justice K David Harris said the court was 
wandering into a subject shot through with searching social and 
ethical questions 
In taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself to 
the eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendant 
social and ethical issues Harris wrote Future litigants 
faced with unanswered questions of great social and ethical 
dimensions or with missing ingredients of a vague application 
process will continue to press us for determinations we are 
singularly unfit to reach 
The majority rejected that reasoning 
We do not believe our courts lack jurisdiction over a case 
merely because the case is important or unavoidably includes a 
constitutional dimension the court said As always we must 
remain mindful that a court cannot escape the demands of judging or 
of making difficult appraisals 
The decision came in a Polk County case involving Jan and Tekla 
Matejski who are legal guardians of their 33yearold mentally 
retarded daughter court records said 
The couple filed an application with a lower court seeking 
authorization to have their daughter sterilized but a lawyer 
appointed by the court to represent the daughters interests argued 
that there was no provision in Iowa law for sterilization 
Polk County Judge Glenn E Pille agreed and dismissed the 
application 
Both sides appealed 
Lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the Legislature 
repealed a law providing for sterilization of people who are 
mentally ill or retarded syphilitic habitual criminals moral 
degenerates or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society 
While agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests the 
high court refused to set guidelines about when it would be 
appropriate 
We are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given the 
posture of the present case the court said The excursion 
suggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisory 
opinion 
The high court did not indicate why the parents wanted their 
daughter sterilized 
Harris wrote that the courts decision would return to haunt it 
At what level of mental retardation can sterilization be 
compelled Harris asked What board or body if any will 
suggest statewide standards 
The good news is that the majority in its obvious and wise 
recognition of its inability to do so chooses not to address these 
questions Harris wrote The bad news is that the majority 
consigns them to Iowas individual trial judges for ad hoc 
determinations 
Iowas trial courts must now face these and undoubtedly a 
host of other public policy decisions 
The leading US Supreme Court case on the issue was Buck vs 
Bell in 1927 in which the court upheld a Virginia law that 
provided for the sterilization of institutionalized retarded 
persons The decision set guidelines including the appointment of a 
guardian a hearing and the right of appeal 
More than 7500 persons were sterilized before Virginia 
abandoned the program in 1972 according to state records cited by 
the Washington Post in 1980 In 1981 the Virginia Legislature 
enacted new guidelines for judges deciding sterilization cases 
In other cases in recent years 
In 1985 the California Supreme Court struck down a law enacted 
in 1980 that banned sterilization of retarded persons The 
following year a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge 
authorized sterilization of a 31yearold woman who had Downs 
Syndrome The operation was sought by her parents 
In 1984 the US Supreme Court killed a 3 million lawsuit 
filed by a woman who had been sterilized at age 14 The woman had 
sought damages from the North Carolina Eugenics Board which 
approved the surgery in 1974 on the grounds that the woman was 
mentally retarded 
A federal appeals court in Virginia had ordered a trial of the 
suit but a US District Court jury in New Bern NC a jury 
rejected her claim 
In 1981 the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that incompetent 
individuals could be sterilized only if a court determined that the 
operation appeared to be in the best interest of the patient and if 
procedural safeguards had been followed The ruling came in a case 
involving a 19yearold woman wit
