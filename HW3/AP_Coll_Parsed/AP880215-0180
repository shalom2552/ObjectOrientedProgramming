A turbine blade from an Eastern Airlines jet 
shattered on takeoff Monday and sparked a brush fire just outside 
the airport but the plane returned safely and no one was injured 
authorities said 
Flight 8 from Miami to Newark NJ was taking off from Miami 
International Airport about 11 am when the incident occurred 
said Jack Barker regional spokesman for the Federal Aviation 
Administration 
Right after takeoff the pilot had a problem with the No 2 
engine and shut it off said Barker Parts of the turbine blade 
came out and landed on airport property and some of them landed in 
a parking lot 
The jet a twinengine Europeanbuilt widebody A300 Airbus can 
fly safely on one engine and the pilot returned to the airport 10 
minutes later without incident said Barker The plane carried 249 
passengers and 10 crew members 
Some passengers said they feared for their lives when the 
turbine disintegrated 
It sounded like it hit something one unidentified woman 
passenger told Miamis WPLGTV There was a loud crash and it 
just dropped for a few seconds and then everybody just clutched 
each other 
Meanwhile the hot pieces of the engine had ignited a small fire 
in a wooded area outside the airport but no buildings were 
threatened and no one was injured 
The fragments ignited rubbish and tires in the lot and four 
fire engines were still fighting the blaze four hours later said 
MetroDade Fire Department disptacher Joanne Davis 
Barker said the cause of the turbine failure is under 
investigation and said there have been only rare problems with 
A300 engines previously 
It could be something sucked into the tube or it could be a 
turbine failure he said
