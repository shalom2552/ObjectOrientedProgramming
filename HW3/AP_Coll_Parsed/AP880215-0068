any subpoena demanding the identity of a doctor who wrote a 
controversial essay on a purported mercy killing the associations 
top lawyer said 
A Cook County grand jury reportedly has subpoenaed the 
manuscript of the Jan 8 article in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association in which a doctor described injecting a fatal 
dose of morphine into a young woman suffering from ovarian cancer 
The AMAs general counsel Kirk Johnson has said that while he 
would honor a court order demanding the documents the association 
would challenge subpoenas under First Amendment protection 
Dr George Lundberg the journals editor said that he has not 
received a subpoena A spokesman for the states attorneys office 
Terry Levin would not comment on any reported grand jury action 
The Chicago SunTimes said Sunday the grand jury has requested 
any inhouse memos about the essay and minutes from editorial staff 
meetings linked to the article as well as the cover letter sent by 
the doctor and the original manuscript 
AMA officials said they did not verify the purported mercy 
killing but believed it was based on fact They said the author 
requested anonymity 
There has been speculation by outsiders that the article titled 
Its Over Debbie was a hoax 
The essay describes how an exhausted gynecology resident gave a 
fatal injection to a patient he had never seen before 
The essay has sparked debate about the ethics of euthanasia 
which editor Lundberg said was the purpose of publishing it 
States Attorney Richard M Daley became involved because the 
Journal and the AMA are based in Chicago The essay did not 
indicate where the author lived or where the purported incident 
took place
