About 1300 Chinese students returned home last 
year after completing studies in the United States leaving 27000 
Chinese at American universities and colleges 
The official China Daily today said 8817 scholars have returned 
from the United States since China began sending students abroad in 
1979 
Chinas overseas study program has become a matter of 
controversy because of the large number of students who are 
refusing to come home opting instead for the better jobs and 
living conditions they find abroad Some of those who have returned 
have had difficulty finding suitable work and readjusting to the 
rigid political and social norms of their native country 
The Beijing government last year announced regulations 
tightening controls over students going abroad and requiring they 
be ideologically and morally sound However officials stress 
that China is still committed to sending students overseas to learn 
skills needed in the nations modernization drive
