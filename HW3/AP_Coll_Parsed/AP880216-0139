Eleven companies conspired in a 
bidrigging scheme that inflated the price of lunchroom milk by at 
least 10 million over a decade an antitrust lawsuit charged 
Tuesday 
The ultimate effect of the conspiracy was to take coins from 
the pockets of Floridas school children We find that to be 
shameful said Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth 
holding up empty halfpint milk cartons similar to those sold in 
schools 
The federal civil suit filed in Miami by the attorney generals 
office represents the largest antitrust action ever taken against 
the milk industry and may be as farreaching as the highway 
bidrigging scandals that rocked some states in the late 1970s 
Butterworth said 
The investigation Butterworth said could result in criminal 
charges in Florida and may spread to other states as well 
The suit was filed against seven major milk producers and four 
Florida distributors alleging that highlevel officials of the 
companies established production levels divided the Florida market 
among themselves and fixed an inflated price on halfpint cartons 
of milk over the past 10 years 
Company spokesmen had little to say about the allegations on 
Tuesday 
The attorney general said the overcharges exceeded at least 10 
million because his office estimated the price of each carton was 
inflated by more than 1 penny More than 1 billion cartons were 
sold during the 10year period 
Butterworth said the state is seeking more than 30 million from 
the companies or three times the amount of the alleged 
overcharges If the state is awarded damages the money will be 
distributed to the public school boards in 32 Florida counties that 
bought the milk and resold it to students he said 
Dairy processors named in the suit were Southland Corp Velda 
Farms of Dallas Borden Inc of Columbus Ohio Flavorich Inc of 
Louisville Ky Dean Foods Products Co of Chicago Pet Inc of 
St Louis Mo Kraft Sealtest of Chicago and Harts Dairy Dean 
Foods of Fort Myers Fla 
Distributors named in the suit were Marshall Simmons Enterprise 
of Mango Pierson Distributors Inc of Opa Locka HampT Distributors 
Inc of Homestead and Butler Foods of Naples All four are in 
Florida 
We understand that the Florida attorney general has filed a 
lawsuit We have not been served with a copy of the suit said 
William Fischer financial vice president of Dean Foods 
We are aware the investigation has been going on in Florida 
and that a number of our employees have been subpoenaed over the 
past few months Other than that we really dont have anything 
else to add Fischer said 
Scott Horne a media relations assistant for Kraft was not 
immediately available for comment his secretary said 
Borden spokesman Chris Tilton said the company had not seen a 
copy of the lawsuit and had no comment 
There was no immediate comment from other milk producers 
contacted The four Florida distributors referred telephone calls 
to the companies whose products they distribute 
These companies went to extraordinary lengths to conceal their 
conspiracy from government officials Butterworth said The 
scope and design of the conspiracy made it almost impossible for an 
individual school district to detect it 
Butterworth said the attorney generals office has been feeding 
data from Florida school boards into a computer for analysis for 
the past two years He declined to say what prompted the 
investigation 
The lawsuit alleged the conspiracy involved Florida counties 
south of Ocala and mostly affected the Dade Broward and 
Hillsborough school districts The 32 counties buy about 1718 
million cartons of milk a year at an annual cost of 257 million
