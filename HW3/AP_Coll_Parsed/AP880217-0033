Deal has died at the age of 91

Corporation and Private Property a study of the behavior of 
major US corporations 
He came to Washington with the New Deal as economics adviser to 
former secretary of agriculture Henry A Wallace He held a variety 
of posts before leaving the government in 1943 
Since 1958 he had been an independent economics consultant 
analyst and author specializing in the study of how the corporate 
economy functions 
He first published his theories on administered prices during 
the 1930s and they gained wide circulation in the 1950s and 1960s 
According to the theory certain corporate giants in industries 
such as oil steel and automobile manufacturing and some labor 
unions have wide discretion over prices they set on their products 
and their members labor 
They are able to set and hold or administer prices 
without regard to fluctuations in demand He observed that profit 
levels were maintained simply by decreasing production and thereby 
reducing costs when demand fell 
He is survived by his wife Caroline F Ware
