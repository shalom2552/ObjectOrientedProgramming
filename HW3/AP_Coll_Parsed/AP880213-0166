NATOs American commander was quoted 
as saying Saturday that new US chemical weapons should be 
deployed in Europe but acknowledged that objections by European 
allies could prevent the move 
In an interview with the Munichbased newspaper Sueddeutsche 
Zeitung Gen John Galvin chief NATO commander in Europe was 
quoted as saying the new binary chemical weapons should be 
stationed where the troops are 
The view is at odds with an agreement between the United States 
and West Germany not to replace aging chemical weapons stored in 
West Germany with a new generation of such weapons 
The newspaper said Galvin acknowledged there were objections 
to his position among NATO allies 
If these objections cannot be resolved then we will have to 
find an alternative That alternative appears to be not to station 
the weapons in Europe Galvin was quoted as saying 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl Foreign Minister HansDietrich Genscher 
and other West German officials have repeatedly called for the 
worldwide destruction of chemical weapons 
Horst Jungmann a security expert for the opposition Social 
Democrats on Saturday criticized Galvins comments and the US 
decision to build the weapons 
The US decision to begin production of binary chemical 
weapons has set back any hope of achieving an agreement to 
eliminate such weapons in the near future Jungmann said in a 
radio interview in Hamburg 
He said the Social Democrats would oppose the deployment of new 
chemical weapons in West Germany 
In December the US Army resumed producing chemicals for the 
weapons President Richard Nixon ordered US production of 
chemical weapons halted in 1969 but President Reagan said the 
resumed production was needed to offset the increasing Soviet 
arsenal of chemical weapons 
The binary weapons are composed of two chemicals kept separate 
until a bomb drops or an artillery shell is fired The two then 
mix forming a deadly gas
