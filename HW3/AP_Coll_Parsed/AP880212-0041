Former President Jimmy Carters boyhood home 
high school and the railroad depot that served as his 1976 campaign 
headquarters are centerpieces of a project to turn his hometown 
into a major tourist attraction 
The National Park Service will assume responsibility for 
preserving the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site during a 
dedication ceremony at the depot on Saturday morning Those 
scheduled to attend include Carter former officials of his 
administration and members of the Georgia congressional delegation 
About 80000 visitors a year stop at the small welcome center in 
Plains an agricultural community of 650 residents in the heart of 
Georgias peanut belt That is down considerably from the hundreds 
of thousands of tourists who visited Plains annually during 
Carters presidency 
But in four or five years after the Park Service has built 
exhibits rehabilitated buildings and made other improvements the 
town could attract up to 300000 visitors a year said John Tucker 
who will manage the Carter site in addition to his duties as 
superintendent of the nearby Andersonville National Historic Site 
There will be a lot people can see and do Tucker said I 
think itll be a lot more attractive to the people going up and 
down I75 
The popularity of the 39th presidents hometown will help the 
surrounding area he said 
One of the primary benefits would be in the area of 
tourism Tucker said Thatll be a tremendous economic benefit 
to Sumter County and southwest Georgia 
President Reagan on Dec 23 signed legislation authorizing the 
Park Service to acquire Carters home on the towns main street 
his boyhood home on the outskirts of town a vacant brick building 
where he attended high school and the depot which houses a Carter 
museum 
Eventually the Carters will donate their home and its 
furnishings to the Park Service but they will occupy the house for 
their lifetimes The Carter home ringed by a metal fence and 
protected by Secret Service agents will be closed to the public 
for now 
Deeds for the railroad depot and high school will be transferred 
to the Park Service during Saturdays ceremony 
In addition to the historic site the federal legislation also 
establishes a 730acre Jimmy Carter National Preservation District 
that includes the town and some surrounding areas 
The Park Service plans to acquire easements in the preservation 
district through donations or purchases to preserve Plains 
smalltown rural character Tucker said
