The new USSoviet nuclear missile pact is 
seriously flawed but its defeat in the Senate would be a 
politically unacceptable blow to the unity of the NATO alliance 
two national security experts say 
Richard Perle who recently stepped down as assistant secretary 
of defense for international security affairs is trying to 
persuade the Senate to change the mediumrange missile treaty 
He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that 
the pact should permit the United States to deploy mediumrange 
groundlaunched cruise missiles armed with nonnuclear explosives 
But Perle said that if it became clear such an amendment would 
have the effect of killing the treaty I would not favor it 
Retired Army Gen Bernard Rogers until recently the supreme 
allied commander in Europe told the committee that he believes the 
treaty overall will have an adverse impact on the military 
situation in Europe He said US Pershing missiles which are to 
be destroyed under the treaty are the one weapon that can strike 
with assurance deep into Soviet territory from Western Europe 
But he said the Senate is faced with a nowin situation because 
it would be almost impossible politically for the United States to 
keep its mediumrange nuclear missile force in Europe even if the 
treaty were defeated 
I would say that failure to ratify might well have a major 
negative impact on NATO and the future viability of the alliance 
Rogers said 
He said the alliance must now insist on modernizing its force of 
shortrange nuclear weapons remaining in Europe as a hedge against 
Soviet aggression 
Both Perle and Rogers questioned whether Soviet compliance with 
the new treaty could be adequately verified 
But in closeddoor hearings before the Senate Intelligence 
Committee a different sort of worry surfaced about the treatys 
verifications provisions 
The concern centered on the onsite inspection provisions of the 
treaty which apply to both sides and permit teams of Soviet 
officials access to certain US missile facilities 
I think onsite inspection presents problems said one 
committee source One of the things were trying to figure out is 
how to keep tabs on the Soviets who are coming here 
Its for sure theyre going to be interested in a lot more 
than looking at Disneyland the source said speaking on 
condition he not be identified by name 
The FBI has responsibility for counterintelligence but FBI 
officials have balked at taking on the job of watching the Soviet 
inspectors said committee sources 
Instead they reported FBI officials have suggested that the 
Army should be given the task 
Meanwhile Sen Sam Nunn DGa chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee reporting on a weeklong trip by Senate leaders 
to Europe said he found a European consensus for modernizing 
shortrange nuclear weapons but no agreement on which weapons to 
build 
Majority Leader Robert Byrd DWVa said European leaders told 
the senators that the INF treaty should be approved without 
amendments and that following that NATO should proceed with 
modernizing those groundbased nuclear weapons that are eligible 
under the treaty
