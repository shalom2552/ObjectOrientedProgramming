A short ride from the White House where 
President Reagan has waged a sevenyear campaign against drugs 
people are being gunned down onebyone in a high stakes drug war 
that shows no signs of abating 
The murders are coming at a record rate double that of last 
year Police say its just a matter of time before a bystander 
is struck in the crossfire 
This drug problem is by no means unique to the district but 
has now reached epidemic proportions affecting the entire nation 
Inspector Larry Soulsby former head of the district police 
homicide branch said recently 
It has now become a manmade plague acting as a cancer which 
eats away at the very fabric of our society he said 
Still the death toll in Washington alone is staggering In the 
first 43 days of 1988 there were 46 murders 35 of them attributed 
to the drug trade Police said many were open hits in which 
victims were shot several times 
Last year 57 percent of the 228 murders in the city were drug 
related compared to 33 percent in 1986 
Police Chief Maurice Turner says police will be issued 9mm 
semiautomatic weapons to match the firepower drug dealers from New 
York and Miami are using to force their way into the citys drug 
market 
Police claim many of these outoftown drug dealers are 
Jamaicans and they have formed a Jamaican task force with 
officers from federal agencies and other police departments in the 
region 
Turner said the dealers are importing the highly potent cocaine 
derivative crack and using extreme violence to stake out their 
turf 
Crack is now the drug of choice in the nations capital 
replacing the hallucingen PCP Turner said 
Vials of crack that sell for 10 to 15 in New York may sell for 
more than 30 in Washington according to narcotics investigators 
Turner said more than 200 dealers come to the nations capital 
each weekend from New York City some carrying 1000 vials of 
crack They sublease apartments where they make their sales 
On Monday morning they go back to New York richer than when 
they came here They make big money They spend big money And they 
go back with big money Turner said 
The residents here tell you about their fear and concern that 
drug dealers are terrorizing neighborhoods said Turner It 
reminds me in some cases of Wild West shootouts 
The city says it is fighting back by coordinating among city 
agencies neighboring jurisdictions in Maryland and Virginia and 
the federal government and putting more police officers on the 
street 
Mayor Marion Barry Jr refuses to put a dollar figure on the 
citys effort Money is not the only answer it is only part of 
it he said We are going to use whatever resources we have 
Bigger doesnt necessarily mean better 
Federal spending for drug enforcement prevention and treatment 
has tripled since Reagan took office rising from 11 billion in 
1981 to 34 billion in 1988 The White House is requesting that 
38 billion be allocated for fiscal 1989 said Paul Sirovatka 
policy analyst for the White House Drug Abuse Policy Office 
In Washington 15 of the murders have been in the Seventh Police 
District a far corner of the citys poor Anacostia section which 
police say holds the greatest share of Washingtons estimated 50 to 
60 openair drug markets 
Thirteen of the 15 have been blamed on drugs 
Bobby Larnell Parker Jrs death last Monday is an example of 
the open hit that has become all too familiar in the city 
Police said Parnell had recently stolen four kilos of cocaine 
worth 280000 and cash from a drug dealer 
As he drove a new luxury automobile through a busy section of 
Anacostia in the early evening he was shot him a dozen times with 
semiautomatic and automatic weapons 
That was an open hit theres no question about it Thats 
very brazen Very daring Turner said 
Even as the police chief spoke Wednesday afternoon a Baltimore 
man was being killed in a hail of gunfire behind an apartment 
complex in Anacostia 
The shooting of Charles Edward Russell 29 also appeared to be 
drug related police said later 
The general public is not caught up in this now but its just 
a matter of time before someone is struck in the crossfire said 
the police chief 
We have younger and younger individuals who are arming 
themselves with semiautomatic weapons the chief said 
Stressing the point to reporters police last week displayed 
some of the 410 firearms they have seized in the city so far this 
year 68 percent more than they had gotten in the same period last 
year 
There were several Uzis laid out before television cameras and 
one officer said the arsenal would be wellsuited for warfare in 
the Middle East 
Parents and church leaders meanwhile are appalled at the 
involvement of youths in bigtime crime 
Nineteen of the murder victims last year under 18 years old 
compared to just six in 1986 
There were 1780 juvenile arrests in the city in the first 11 
months of 1987 more than twice the total of 883 for all of 1985 
On Jan 26 two 14yearold youths were arrested at a motel with 
48000 worth of drugs police said 
A 12yearold boy was arrested in early January in southeast 
Washington carrying a 9mm semiautomatic weapon 
Barbara Merriweather formed a group called Citizens Redirecting 
Youth after her 17yearold son Kendall was fatally shot on the 
way to school last December His killers wanted his boom box radio 
police said 
Our children are being killed and theres a reason why Mrs 
Merriweather said I know that drugs play a part but society as 
a whole also plays a part We have to put some morals back into our 
children and back into society
