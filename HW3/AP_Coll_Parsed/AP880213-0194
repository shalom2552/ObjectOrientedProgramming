A judge Friday sentenced an antinuclear 
protester to 33 months in prison for sabotaging the Navys Project 
ELF submarine communications site last August 
Ashland County Circuit Judge William Chase rejected a defense 
recommendation calling for probation with restitution through 
community service A college president and local priests had 
offered to provide community service jobs for George Ostensen in 
lieu of a prison term 
Ostensen 33 formerly of Baltimore and West Hampton NY was 
convicted by a jury Jan 8 on one count of sabotage and acquitted 
on a second count The conviction carried a possible maximum 
penalty of 10 years in prison and 10000 fine 
Authorities said he caused 11000 damage to the ELF site at 
Clam Lake He admitted cutting down transmission poles and damaging 
electrical boxes at the site Aug 16 the date of the harmonic 
convergence a time said by believers to be the peak of a period 
when the earth moved into a new era of peace and harmony 
The damage caused the transmitter to shut down for about 29 
hours Biblical references were also spraypainted throughout the 
ELF compound and banners with quotes from the Bible were hung 
The ELF extremely low frequency transmitter sends coded 
signals providing worldwide communications with underwater Trident 
submarines The Clam Lake antenna has operated since the 1970s and 
another is under construction in Michigans Upper Peninsula 
The judge said he shared Ostensens concern about a buildup of 
nuclear weaponry but said he felt compelled to give Ostensen a 
prison sentence because committing sabotage was not the way to make 
his point 
Ostensen said he took full responsibility for the actions but 
felt he had to do something to get people to think about 
humanitarian efforts instead of relying on a nuclear arsenal for 
defense
