Harddrinking crowds poured into the French 
Quarter on Monday to herald the coming of Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday 
as the preLenten Carnival season that began Jan 6 headed for 
its raucous often raunchy end 
Revelers started wandering into Pat OBriens bar between 
Bourbon and Royal streets at about 10 am said Judy Polgar a 
bookkeeper at the famous watering hole By midafternoon the line 
outside the door of the popular tourist spot stretched for half a 
block 
Weve got a good crowd said Polgar who was in an office 
just off the establishments open patio bar I can hear them 
When I can hear them I know weve got a pretty good crowd 
Shouldertoshoulder crowds made it difficult to walk down 
Bourbon or Royal 
Outoftown revelers started trickling into New Orleans last 
week and they came in droves during the weekend undaunted by cold 
windy weather or Sunday thunderstorms 
On Monday sometimes dubbed Lundi Gras or Fat Monday the 
thunderstorms gave way to sunshine and mild temperatures 
Police spokesman John Marie said Tuesdays crowds could surpass 
the estimated 1 million people that jammed the metropolitan area 
streets last year 
We do anticipate the crowds to possibly be record crowds as 
the weather forecast looks great said Marie 
Crowds on Fat Tuesday usually stretch from the stately uptown 
area where families gather before sunrise to stake out picnic 
areas on the parade routes to the central business district where 
business virtually shuts down and on to the French Quarter scene 
of Carnivals raunchiest goingson 
In the Quarter women on wroughtiron balconies bare their 
breasts and gay bars play host to male crossdressers barely clad 
in various combinations of womens underwear hosiery high heels 
feathered headresses and beaded gowns 
Theres a high degree of tolerance by the police on Mardi Gras 
day Marie explained Sometimes the costumes can be outlandish 
But if there are lewd or obscene gestures made then the 
police have to take action 
Parades this past weekend featured the usual mix of staid 19th 
century tradition and 1980s bawdiness The mostly female Krewe of 
Iris formed in 1917 featured fairytale themes and its masked 
riders tossed the traditional plastic beads cups and other 
trinkets to the thousands who lined city streets 
By contrast the 20yearold Krewe of Tucks featured a king and 
queen aboard huge golden toilets Its maskers threw underwear 
As usual the Krewe of Bacchus made the biggest splash in its 
Sunday night parade Along with its huge animated floats and 
celebrity king actor Alan Thicke it featured a huge moving 
aquarium filled with water and a dozen young women in scanty 
mermaid attire
