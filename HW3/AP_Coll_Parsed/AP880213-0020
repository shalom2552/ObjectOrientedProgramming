people packed rides and amusements at Hialeah High Schools annual 
charity carnival just northwest of Miami

another group of kids and began arguing we believe over a girl

off very quickly and by the time police could react the gunman had 
taken off in a car 
One teenager was dead at the scene and two more were airlifted 
to Jackson Memorial Hospital one with gunshots to the knee and 
another with arm wounds said Coffin He said the names of the 
victims and suspect were not yet available
