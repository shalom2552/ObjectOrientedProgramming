during the debate Youre using the same language as Jim

PAT ROBERTSON disclosing that a source on the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee had told him the Soviets had placed missiles in 
Cuba Somehow in all this brilliant negotiation which these 
gentlemen are so proud of they left that out of the treaty And it 
seems like to me nukes pointing at the United States are more vital 
to our security than nukes pointing to Europe

Pete du Pont saying the next president should be a man of clear 
vision and strong principle Thats not George Bushs style and 
thats not Bob Doles history

is now ahead of Dick Gephardt What we want to make clear in these

GARY HART defending his continued campaign as not just an ego 
trip Im not a dog in the manger Im not a spoiler

ALBERT GORE JR I dont want to say any Democrat is 
unelectable It is legitimate for Democratic voters to ask who can 
best win

RICHARD GEPHARDT on whether he was a supporter of Reagans tax 
and economics program Thats just balderdash I have been the 
leader against Reaganomics in the House

MICHAEL DUKAKIS If the next president is required to use 
force it will almost certainly be conventional forces and not 
nuclear The next president isnt going to be giving blank 
checks to the Pentagon or to anybody else If he did the checks 
would bounce
