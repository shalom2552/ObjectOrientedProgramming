President Reagan on Thursday declared that 
AIDS is his highest public health priority and asked Congress 
for a 38 percent budget boost to 13 billion to combat the 
deadly and spreading disease 
In addition the budget envisions spending 736 million under 
Medicaid and Medicare to care for people already suffering from the 
illness 
Congress consistently has appropriated more than Reagan 
requested for AIDS but the general outlines for the fiscal 1989 
proposal were worked out in closer consultation than in previous 
years and Congress is not as likely to vote a large addition this 
year 
For example Reagans initial request for AIDS spending for 
fiscal 1988 was 534 million compared with the 951 million 
eventually approved by Congress 
For fiscal 1987 Reagan initially requested 213 million for 
AIDS and Congress wound up allocating 502 million 
The huge jump for AIDS spending stands out even more starkly 
when compared with the net increase of 58 percent proposed for 
overall operation of the 250 programs administered by the 
Department of Health and Human Services which oversees roughly a 
third of all federal spending 
The total HHS budget is to rise from 3751 billion to 3968 
billion 
But the bulk of that nearly 95 percent goes for socalled 
entitlement programs such as Social Security Medicare and 
Medicaid over which the administration has marginal control 
because basic eligiblity criteria including treatment of AIDS 
patients are laid down by law 
Social Securitys old age and disability programs alone are 
expected to grow by 14 billion or 64 percent to 2338 billion 
That includes money for new recipients coming onto the rolls as the 
population ages as well as an anticipated 42 percent 
costofliving increase next January for all 38 million 
beneficiaries 
Medicaid the statefederal health program for poor people will 
cost the federal government 327 billion in 1989 up 7 percent 
from 307 billion currently 
Much of the Medicaid increase is attributed to additional 
spending on AIDS patients an estimated 40 percent of whom qualify 
for the program either when they first contract the disease or soon 
afterward because they become unable to work 
Medicaid spending on AIDS is estimated at 375 million this year 
and is budgeted to grow to 600 million next year 
Medicare spending for 33 million elderly or disabled workers is 
projected to rise to 84 billion from 789 billion 
The most controversial part of the HHS budget is likely to be 
Reagans proposal for 12 billion in Medicare cuts he says are 
necessary to meet the deficitreduction targets that Congress and 
the administration agreed to in December 
Those differences largely boil down to disagreement over whether 
Congressional Budget Office projections of overall Medicare 
spending are more accurate than those projected by the Office of 
Management and Budget 
Deficit negotiators agreed previously to cut 35 million from 
Medicare and the administration argues that the 12 billion cut in 
its proposal will be needed to meet that target 
The chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate 
Finance Committee already have written to the White House 
expressing determination to fight the additional cut 
Of the 12 billion in question about 1 billion would come 
from reducing special payments made to large teaching hospitals to 
help cover educational costs of interns 
At a briefing on the HHS budget department chief of staff 
Thomas Burke cited a recent inspector generals finding that the 
teaching hospitals Medicare profits are 2 times that of their 
nonteaching counterparts 
It would seem these hospitals are going to be able to absorb 
this reduction Burke said 
The other 200 million in savings would come from limiting 
Medicare payments for durable medical equipment reducing payments 
for radiology and anesthesiology services closing a loophole in 
payments for home dialysis treatment for endstage renal disease 
more intense of physician claims and by making permanent the 
existing requirement that Medicare Part B monthly premiums now 
2480 cover 25 percent of the program costs 
AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
The Centers for Disease Control reports that as of Jan 25 
1988 AIDS had been diagnosed in 51916 Americans of whom more 
than half or 28965 have died since 1979 No one is known to have 
recovered from AIDS
