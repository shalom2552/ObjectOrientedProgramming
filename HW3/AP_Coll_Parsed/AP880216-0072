A few puddles were all that remained of the water at 
the Trevi Fountain on Tuesday as surveyors began measuring the 
landmark for a facelift but that didnt stop visitors from 
throwing coins into its empty basin 
The water was turned off so that workers could carry out a 
photographic survey in preparation for the first restoration of the 
17th century fountain in more than 30 years 
The restoration is aimed at removing discoloration caused by 
smog The project will last a year but will proceed in stages and 
the water will run in the parts of the fountain where the work is 
not being done 
Officials said the work will cost about 830000 
The fountain built of travertine and marble was designed by 
the sculptor Bernini in 1640 and executed by Nicola Salvi 90 years 
later 
Legend has it that a visitor who tosses a coin in the fountain 
will return to Rome some day
