A coroners official Monday termed suspicious 
the death of a newlywed whose husband said she was blown overboard 
into the Pacific Ocean while jogging during their honeymoon cruise 
An autopsy was performed Sunday on Karen Waltz Roston 26 of 
Santa Monica but the cause of death probably wont be released 
until Tuesday said Deputy Coroner Robert Grubb of the San Diego 
County Coroners office 
Right now its pending Grubb said However we can tell 
you the death occurred under suspicious circumstances 
The womans husband of one week Scott Robin Roston 36 a 
chiropractor who moved from Florida to Santa Monica in June was 
held Monday by federal officials in Los Angeles following his 
arrest for investigation of murder 
Roston was taken into custody Saturday when the cruise ship Star 
Dancer docked in Los Angeles Harbor He was held without bail at 
the Terminal Island federal prison

imagine that he would want to hurt her let alone kill her 
Rostons roommate told the Los Angeles Herald Examiner She asked 
that her name not be used 
FBI spokesman Fred Reagan declined to release details of what 
led to Rostons arrest Roston was expected to appear in federal 
court later this week 
The couple were married Feb 6 before embarking on a honeymoon 
cruise of the Mexican coast with 731 other passengers 
Roston told authorities that high winds blew his wife off the 
deck near the ships jogging track about 2 am Saturday but the 
winds were not that strong Star Dancer Capt Thomas Wildung said 
Also Chief Purser Ken Ehlers said the track closed at 9 pm 
and he never heard the couple running even though the track is 
over his room 
And passenger Dick Heinrich an assistant chief deputy at the 
Cook County Sheriffs Department in Chicago told authorities he 
noticed what appeared to be hair and earring posts when he went for 
a walk on the deck where Mrs Roston allegedly went over 
The woman was reported overboard when the ship was about 44 
miles southwest of San Diego The Coast Guard found her body later 
that day
