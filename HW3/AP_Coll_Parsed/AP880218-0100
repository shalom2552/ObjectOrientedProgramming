The financial challenge of waging a 
simultaneous campaign in 20 states has presidential campaigns fresh 
from New Hampshire scheming about where to get money for the 
expensive Super Tuesday contest 
Most campaigns are closemouthed about how much they want to 
spend on the March 8 series of Super Tuesday primaries which 
include all the Southern states but one 
But the only one who is already on the air with commercials in 
the South Sen Al Gore Jr of Tennessee said he will spend up 
to a minimum of 3 million on television ads alone 
You could spend an infinite amount running ads in all 20 
states said Bill Carrick campaign manager for Democratic 
contender Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri 
Gephardt has just enough money to meet his 200000 in 
outstanding bills said Carrick But he has no bank debts at this 
point and hopes to raise 2 million through fundraising events in 
the next three weeks 
One Democratic contender Sen Paul Simon of Illinois said 
Wednesday that hell be out of the race unless he can find more 
money 
One the other hand another Democrat Massachusetts Gov Michael 
Dukakis has 4 million avspent 95 million against it by the end 
of 1987 
Wellfunded campaigns must budget carefully so they can spend 
enough on the later states without going over the 27 million limit
