Homeless people are younger more likely to be 
women and less likely to be working than the homeless of a 
generation ago a study shows 
Were getting the harvest of the last decades very high 
unemployment rate among minorities said Peter Rossi a professor 
of sociology at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst 
Rossi who has studied the history of homelessness and collected 
statistics on the current homeless population was to describe his 
findings today at the annual meeting of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science 
He said at a news conference Friday that the average age of the 
homeless in the 1950s was 59 There were virtually no women and 
very few of them slept out on the streets he said 
Many stayed in skidrow flophouses If they slept downtown 
the police would pick them up he said 
Police policies changed in the 1960s however and arrests for 
vagrancy and public drunkenness dropped Rossi said 
About 25 percent of the homeless are now women the result of a 
short supply of eligible working males able to support a household 
The age has dropped enormously Rossi said Its now 
around 36 Very few are over age 65 
One of the most encouraging things I found was the 
disappearance of people over 65 by virtue of the rise in the value 
of social security he said 
Few of the homeless are now employed although that varies in 
different areas Rossi said In contrast many homeless men were 
able to find day labor in the 1950s 
You might say the forklift truck has depleted the market for 
day work unloading trucks he said 
Jon Erickson of the State and Local Expenditure Policy 
Commission of New Jersey said that job training programs have 
helped some homeless people get back to work and have their own 
homes again 
An effort to find jobs for 580 homeless in New Jersey was partly 
successful he said About onefourth of them got jobs Most were 
employed as security guards clerical workers or in construction 
Erickson said Eightyfour percent earned less than 7 per hour 
Rossi has found that the proportion of homeless who come from 
minority groups has risen In New York City for example 85 
percent of the homeless are black or Hispanic 
Estimates of the total number of homeless in the United States 
vary from 250000 to several million Rossi said He guesses and 
emphasized that he is only guessing that the low estimates are 
nearer to the truth 
Some of the homeless Rossi said are adults with relatives who 
might support them but those relatives are often so close to being 
impoverished themselves that they cannot support adult dependents 
no matter how generous they might want to be
