Many West Europeans feel the United States did 
little to protect their interests at the summit last December but 
most believe America would keep its pledge to defend them 
according to a survey sponsored by the US government 
The survey conducted for the US Information Agency also 
found that most West Europeans support the treaty signed at the 
Washington summit to remove American and Soviet mediumrange 
nuclear missiles from Europe 
However the agency did not repeat a question from a similar 
poll reported last June which yielded results embarrassing to the 
Reagan administration That poll showed that a huge majority of 
West Europeans gave credit for the treaty to Kremlin leader Mikhail 
Gorbachev rather than to President Reagan 
The Senate has been conducting hearings leading up to a vote on 
whether to ratify the Intermediaterange Nuclear Forces treaty 
The new poll found overwhelming European support for the treaty 
ranging from 97 percent in West Germany to 78 percent in France 
with most registering strong support 65 percent in Britain 
79 percent in Italy 76 percent in the Netherlands and 77 percent 
in West Germany 
Most of those polled believe that if the treaty is ratified and 
the missiles removed the United States will remain committed to 
the defense of Western Europeand will do whatever is 
necessary to defend their countries Fiftynine percent felt that 
way in Britain 61 percent in France 67 percent in Italy 57 
percent in the Netherlands and 56 percent in West Germany Belgians 
were divided 46 percent agreeing and 44 percent disagreeing 
But many also said they believe the Reagan administration did 
little to protect West European interests at the summit 
Asked how well they thought their countrys interests were 
protected at the summer 17 percent of the Belgians said they 
thought they were protected a great deal or a fair amount 
the response given by 16 percent in France 28 percent in Germany 
40 percent in Italy 34 percent in the Netherlands and 31 percent 
in Britain 
Those answering not very much or not at all were 68 
percent in Belgium 61 percent in France 65 percent in Germany 40 
percent in Italy 55 percent in the Netherlands and 56 percent in 
Britain 
A sizable minority of West Europeans polled believe the treaty 
makes them more vulnerable to Soviet attack 29 percent in Belgium 
26 percent in Britain 33 percent in France 24 percent in Italy 
34 percent in the Netherlands and 16 percent in West Germany 
Majorities or pluralities in all six countries said the Soviets 
signed the treaty in part because NATO decided in 1979 to deploy 
US Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Europe to counter Soviet 
SS20s Responding that way were 45 percent in Belgium 51 percent 
in Great Britain 46 percent in France 72 percent in Italy 63 
percent in the Netherlands and 50 percent in Germany 
Similar percentages believe that NATO should halt the withdrawal 
of the US missiles if the Soviets are found to be cheating 67 
percent in Britain 65 percent in France 50 percent in Italy 55 
percent in the Netherlands and 59 percent in Germany Belgians were 
again divided with 41 percent favoring a halt and 45 percent 
continued withdrawal 
Majorities ranging from 78 percent in France to 94 percent in 
Italy described USSoviet relations as good or very good 
The survey was based on telephone interviews with about 500 
citizens in each of the countries Dec 1416 immediately after the 
summit at which the INF pact was signed 
The Associated Press obtained an agency report on the latest 
survey last week The agency analysis of the report did not provide 
a breakdown of those answering all the questions but instead drew 
conclusions from the data and published some results 
The US Information Agency has polled West European public 
opinion since shortly after World War II and the results are 
circulated to American officials in Washington and overseas to 
guide them in relations with foreign nations 
The agency tries to promote the image of the United States 
abroad and advance US views through programs such as the Voice of 
America radio system and the Worldnet television satellite system 
The margin of error for results of the December poll was plus or 
minus 5 percentage points Agency polls are conducted by 
independent companies within each country
