Minority students occupying a University 
of Massachusetts building remained today after they failed to agree 
on an understanding reached by their negotiators and college 
officials 
Im not disappointed Im tired Weve been going at this a 
long time Dwayne Warren a spokesman for the group said at a 4 
am news conference announcing the deadlock 
Two women wept in the halls of the New Africa House after about 
100 protesters debated for five hours on the administrations 
response to their eight demands 
The demands included suspending five white students accused of 
beating two blacks Feb 7 and suspending campus police officers 
accused of forming a lineup of blacks the same night in their 
search for men who allegedly harassed women on campus 
The students want immediate action but the way the structure 
is set up you cant get that said a student negotiator David 
Moore 
Moore said the protesters planned to continue the debate at noon 
today in the building they have closed to whites since Friday 
All but one of the nine student negotiators were pleased with 
the understanding reached with university Chancellor Joseph Duffey 
after four hours of talks Tuesday 
Not all the demands have been met but all have been responded 
to in good faith Duffey said as he forwarded a written statement 
to the students at 1030 pm Tuesday There are things I cannot 
do now but weve agreed to plan to address general concerns 
But the mood quickly changed when the demands and Duffeys 
response went before the 100 students occupying the building late 
Tuesday 
The vote is going very slowly and is being met with mixed 
emotions Roscoe Robinson another spokesman for the protesters 
reported as the debate wore on 
Warren had said the students were prepared to take over another 
building if they failed to reach an agreement with university 
officials 
After the deadlock however he ruled it out At this point 
its too radical an approach he said 
He declined to give details about the debate except to say that 
students felt Duffeys response to their demands was vague 
Administrators did not release the document sent to the 
students but Warren said it contained a promise of efforts to 
improve minority students conditions and increase financing of 
minority programs 
More than 500 white UMass students rallied Tuesday to support 
the occupation 
Hey ho Chancellor Joe racism has got to go white 
supporters chanted as Duffey made his way to the building 
Students and faculty members also read letters of support at the 
rally including a message from Democratic presidential candidate 
Jesse Jackson 
The students occupying the New Africa House have taken a 
principled position on legitimate concerns Jackson said in his 
statement The quality of leadership in the state and country can 
be determined by how it handles such crises as this one 
The university moved classes that usually meet in New Africa 
House and officials have said they do not intend to force the 
students out of the building 
About 9 percent of the 25000 students at the states largest 
public university are minorities including 641 blacks 
Last year the university disciplined six white students who 
pleaded no contest to charges stemming from a campus racial clash 
in which a black student was beaten after the final 1986 World 
Series game between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets
