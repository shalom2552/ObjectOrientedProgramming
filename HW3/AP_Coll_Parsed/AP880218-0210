Youre a liar John Demjanjuks wife 
screamed at a prosecutor Thursday as the yearlong Nazi war crimes 
trial of the retired Ohio autoworker ended 
Shame on you Shame on you You have no heart Vera 
Demjanjuk shouted 
Mrs Demjanjuk 63 her daughter Irene Nishnic and son John 
Jr mounted the stage of the converted movie theater where the 
trial was held to confront prosecutors 
Security guards pushed the sobbing women out of the courtroom 
The sounds of a scuffle could be heard followed by an angry 
expletive from Demjanjuks son 
Demjanjuk 67 appeared startled but did not otherwise react 
The Ukrainianborn defendant is accused of being Ivan the 
Terrible a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 
850000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazioccupied Poland 
Demjanjuk insists he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity 
He was stripped of his US citizenship in 1981 and later 
extradited to Israel to stand trial for war crimes 
Holocaust survivor Mordechai Fuchs also interrupted the session 
tearfully waving an aging photograph of his parents and three 
brothers and sister who were killed at Treblinka 
I was among the dead and I am here in court today The 
defense lawyers are liars sobbed Fuchs 63 who said he 
escaped death by jumping from the train transporting his family to 
Treblinka 
The threejudge panel is expected to issue its verdict in April 
The proceeding which began Feb 16 1987 was the first war crimes 
trial in Israel since Nazi mastermind Adolf Eichmann was convicted 
and hanged in 1962 
The lengthy proceedings were broadcast live on television and 
radio Initially spectators waited hours in line for seats but 
interest waned and the final session was sparsely attended 
The Demjanjuk familys emotional outburst came after defense 
attorney John Gill ended his final arguments and prosecutor 
Michael Shaked rose to respond to accusations that the prosecution 
withheld documents that could exonerate Demjanjuk 
Shaked said the prosecution had given all material to the 
defense on a silver platter and even translated it 
John Jr 22 rose angrily from his front row seat walked onto 
the stage turned and said Youre a liar 
He was followed by Mrs Nishnic 28 who shook her fist and 
screamed Youre lying Youre lying before bursting into 
tears 
Mrs Demjanjuk then rose and in a heavily accented voice 
shaking with emotion shouted Youre a liar You liar Shame on 
you Shame on you You have no heart nothing She was pulled 
from the stage by two security guards 
After the familys outburst presiding Judge Dov Levine told 
Shaked and the defense team You both ought to do away with this 
bitterness because we believe there was fair treatment 
Demjanjuks family said they did not believe he received a fair 
trial 
Theyve been lying from the beginning and theyre ending with 
a lie Mrs Nishnic told The Associated Press tearfully after the 
trial her hands shaking 
We didnt expect the trial to end like that with statements 
that arent true The defense should have been the ones to have the 
last say she said 
John Jr said the family believed statements from 21 camp 
survivors who did not identify Demjanjuk as Ivan had been 
withheld by the US Justice Department and the prosecution had 
not intervened to help 
Israels purpose has been to educate young Israelis about the 
Holocaust and if they were to acquit my dad that would not serve 
their purpose he said 
Demjanjuk has been plagued throughout the trial by a poor 
defense He fired Mark OConnor his attorney of seven years 
midway through the proceedings 
Several defense witnesses were discredited including one who 
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide 
after her credentials were called into question during 
crossexamination 
Resting the defense case Gill called on judges to recognize the 
prosecution had not presented the proof necessary to convict this 
innocent man 
We have presented evidence sufficient to destroy the 
prosecution case Gill said John Demjanjuks life is in your 
hands 
According to Israeli law both the verdict and sentence are 
reached by a majority vote of the three judges 
Levine said the date of the verdict would be announced 10 days 
in advance If Demjanjuk is convicted a separate sentencing 
hearing will be held about one month after the verdict Demjanjuk 
could be sentenced to death 
Defense lawyer Paul Chumak apologized for comparing the 
proceedings with the case in which Alfred Dreyfus a Jewish officer 
in the French army was falsely convicted of treason at the 
beginning of this century 
Chumak told the court Wednesday that Dreyfus was convicted on 
the basis of false documents in a wave of antiSemitism 
Paralleling this with antiUkrainism this trial has all the 
earmarks of the Dreyfus trial 
Dreyfus was later exonerated 
On Thursday Chumak said he meant no criticism or disrespect 
whatsoever to this honorable court If there were any such 
inference that anyone could draw then of course I apologize 
unhesitatingly
