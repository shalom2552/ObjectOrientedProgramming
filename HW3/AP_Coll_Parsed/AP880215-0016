Mathematics theoretical physics and oceanography 
are among the fields in which American scientists are likely to 
learn much from their Soviet colleagues during upcoming exchanges 
according to a delegation of Soviet scientists 
The Soviet researchers were in Boston Sunday to describe current 
Soviet research at the annual meeting of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science 
Seven administrators from the most prestigious Soviet science 
institutes answered a wide range of questions from reporters in a 
rare meeting with the press Saturday 
The researchers seemed relaxed and they answered questions 
without hesitation including difficult questions on Soviet 
development of a Star Wars defense system 
The Soviet Union does not intend to develop a system like the 
United States is working on said Andrey A Kokoshin deputy 
director of the Institute for USA and Canada Studies 
A few moments later when another Soviet researcher demonstrated 
a flashlightsized laser pointer of the type used by speakers to 
call attention to details on projected slides Kokoshin elicited 
laughter when he said This is our SDI Strategic Defense 
Initiative 
Asked about development of chemical lasers which might be used 
in a missile defense system Kokoshin said They are not very 
promising I would say 
On Jan 12 Frank Press of the US National Academy of Sciences 
and Guriy Marchuk president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences 
signed a fiveyear agreement providing for scientific exchanges and 
cooperation 
Under the terms of that agreement joint scientific workshops 
will be held during the next two years on such topics as vaccine 
development earthquake prediction planetary science 
biotechnology and astrophysics 
Konstantin V Frolov vicepresident of the Academy of Sciences 
of the USSR said that mathematics theoretical physics and 
laser and semiconductor technology are some of the traditional 
strongholds of Soviet science 
The Soviet Union has developed a number of sophisticated 
scientific instruments he said speaking through a translator 
Computer software useful in oceanography has also been developed 
in the Soviet Union he said 
In the upcoming scientific exchanges he said these are areas 
where the Soviet side could bring something to the table 
He proposed that joint ventures be established to develop 
computer manufacture There was quite a gap in the introduction 
of computers in the Soviet Union particularly personal 
computers he said 
Yuriy A Ossipyan director of the Institute for Solid State 
Physics said that Soviet scientists had developed a new 
description of the interaction of materials in certain 
hightemperature superconductors He said that research on 
superconductivity is being actively pursued at his institute and 
elsewhere in the Soviet Union 
In a presentation Sunday Mikhail V Ivanov director of the 
Institute for Microbiology said that the Soviet union has built 
industrial plants for the production of animal feed through yeast 
fermentation 
Bacteria are being used to leach metals from poor quality ores 
to decrease potentially dangerous levels of methane gas in coal 
mines and to enhance oil recovery Ivanov said 
Albert Galeev of the Institute for Space Research described the 
planned launch in July of a spacecraft to study the Martian moon 
Phobos which may be an asteroid that got trapped in orbit around 
Mars
