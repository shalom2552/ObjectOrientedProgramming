Firestone Tire amp Rubber Co said Tuesday it 
planned to spin off its worldwide tire business into a 15 billion 
joint venture to be 75 percent owned by Tokyobased Bridgestone 
Corp 
Firestone said the transaction which must be approved by its 
shareholders was expected to result in a 1 billion cash 
distribution to Firestone shareholders as part of a major financial 
restructuring according to a joint statement 
The company also said its board of directors adopted a poison 
pill takeover defense 
Firestone stock soared 925 to 45 a share in New York Stock 
Exchange trading following the disclosures 
The surprise announcements came amid speculation that Firestone 
would sell its Akron Ohiobased tire division to the Italian tire 
manufacturer Pirelli SpA 
According to the trade publication Rubber amp Plastics News 
Firestone was the worlds fifthlargest tire company in terms of 
sales with 1986 tire sales of 23 billion 
Firestone posted total profit of 103 million and revenue of 
38 billion in the year ended Oct 31 1987 
The tentative agreement with Bridgestone calls for Firestone to 
transfer tire assets and liabilities with an equity value of about 
15 billion to the joint venture 
The venture would be financed initially with 750 million in 
equity from Bridgestone 250 million from Firestone and 500 
million in debt the statement said 
Bridgestone would own about 75 percent of the company and 
Firestone 25 percent the statement said 
The two companies plan to operate the joint venture which will 
be known as the Firestone Tire Co as a relatively autonomous 
business unit subject to the direction and control of a board of 
directors consisting of persons representing the owners the 
statement said 
Firestone spokesman Robert Troyer said the company would retain 
its 1500 car care centers Firestone Diversified Products which 
includes divisions that manufacture industrial and building 
products Firestone Synthetic Rubber and Latex Co which 
manufactures synthetic rubber and operates a rubber plantation in 
Liberia Africa and Firestone Car Rental Inc 
Troyer said the tire division employs 30000 people worldwide 
while the rest of Firestones businesses employ 23500 
The joint venture would be based in Akron Ohio and would be 
assigned the exclusive right to use Firestones name on tires 
throughout the world 
The tentative agreement also calls for the joint venture to 
arrange contracts for raw materials with Firestones remaining 
businesses and to supply tires to its car care centers 
In a related move Tuesday Firestones board adopted a poison 
pill antitakeover plan to guard against unfriendly suitors 
The plan would take effect if any person or group buys 20 
percent or more of Firestones common stock without board approval 
The company said the plan was intended both to ensure that 
Firestones shareholders will retain the benefits of a joint 
venture with Bridgestone and to protect the full value of its 
shareholders investment in the company 
Weekend news reports in Rome and Milan Italy quoted Pirelli 
officials as saying their company had the financial strength to 
acquire Firestone and added that Pirelli representatives had 
visited Firestones world headquarters in Chicago last week 
I have no comment on the Pirelli deal said Firestone 
spokesman Robert Troyer That story was based on rumor and I 
have no comment on rumors 
The announcement on the Bridgestone deal came as Firestones 
board met in Chicago for a regularly scheduled session 
Firestone is the thirdlargest tire manufacturer in the United 
States behind Goodyear Tire amp Rubber Co and Uniroyal Goodrich 
Tire Co 
In previous interviews Firestone Chairman John J Nevin had 
acknowledged the company might withdraw from the tire business 
Firestone structured the tire business as a freestanding unit 
last November when its corporate staff moved from Akron to Chicago 
The company will seek shareholder approval next month to change its 
name to Firestone Inc It was not immediately known if shareholders 
would be asked to approve the joint venture at that meeting
