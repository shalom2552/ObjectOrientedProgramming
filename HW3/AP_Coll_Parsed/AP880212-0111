A smallbusiness survey released today indicates 
inflation could become a worsening problem during 1988 
The National Federation of Independent Business which studies 
responses from more than 2000 member firms each quarter said a 
trend toward more frequent and larger price increases has become 
quite evident 
While signs of economic deterioration werent sharply defined in 
the latest study the inflation component jumped sharply said 
Professor William C Dunkelberg who interprets the findings 
Dunkelberg dean of Temple Universitys school of business said 
27 percent of all companies in the survey said they plan to raise 
prices a 6 percentage point jump from the previous survey and the 
highest level in several years 
The sharp rise in price expectations among respondents is 
considered significant for the economy as a whole since the 
smallbusiness community produces about 50 percent of the nations 
gross private product 
In spite of the negative implications of the inflation component 
and despite expressions of doubt about the economys future the 
survey showed businesses plan to spend on equipment inventory and 
additional jobs 
Such spending plans said Dunkelberg appear inconsistent with a 
rise in negative opinions about future business conditions 
Each year since 1985 he said the percentage of companies 
expecting a worsening of conditions rises while the number 
anticipating better markets shrinks Simultaneously those 
declaring it to be a good time to expand fell to just 13 percent of 
all companies a fouryear January low 
Apparently many believe the law of gravity applies to 
economic statistics as well as to apples he said explaining 
that the longer the recovery continues the greater is the 
percentage believing it will end 
Negative and positive variations in the January report left the 
smallbusiness optimism index almost unchanged at 1018 seasonally 
adjusted compared with 1023 in the previous quarter 
The index which sets 1978 as its base is made up of responses 
to 10 questions including expected business conditions current 
job openings plans for capital outlays expected credit 
conditions and changes in net earnings 
The latest reading of the optimism index which was begun in 
late 1974 compares with an alltime high of 1087 in January 1984 
and an alltime low of 811 in the second quarter of 1980 Except 
for brief dips in the final quarters of 1985 and 1986 the index 
has exceeded 100 in every survey since early 1983 
Some highlights of the components include 
Employment Strongest hiring plans since 1978 Nineteen 
percent of companies plan to increase employment in the next three 
months while 5 percent plan net reductions 
Job openings reached a new high for the expansion with 23 
percent reporting unfilled positions In New England the 
percentage was 42 percent 
New hiring plans were strongest in manufacturing with 28 
percent planning increases and only 8 percent planning workforce 
reductions 
Interest Rates Average interest rates paid by small companies 
held at 111 percent in the fourth quarter of the year Fifty 
percent of all shortterm loans were tied to the prime rate 
Prices There are indications Dunkelberg said that inflation 
could be worse than generally anticipated Based on plans to 
raise prices nonfood inflation should begin to pick up heading 
toward the 5 percent level 
Commenting on the decline in business expectations Dunkelberg 
said if this view produces a caution in spending on the part of 
more and more decisionmakers the economy cannot help but slip 
The big exception to this he added is if foreigners become 
exceptionally aggressive buyers of US goods
