For timeless torch singer Brenda Lee 
the dilemma is not what to sing but what to leave out 
With a career spanning more than 30 years she finds it 
impossible to sing all her hit records during one concert 
I do three medleys and still have to leave out a bunch the 
irrepressible 43yearold performer says Id be up there three 
hours if I sang them all 
Her tender bluesy voice on such songs as Im Sorry and 
All Alone Am I has carried her to record sales of about 100 
million 
It feels pretty good she says Its kind of unbelievable 
in a way But it feels great 
After 12 millionselling single records and performances in 52 
foreign nations she embarks on another career milestone this year 
Shes set to begin appearing in a musical called Music Music 
Music at Opryland USA in Nashville 
Its a preliminary step to what she hopes might be performing on 
Broadway Earlier in her career she did summer stock in The 
Wizard of Oz and Bye Bye Birdie 
Its always been in the back of my mind she says about the 
yearning for the New York stage But I dont know if it ever will 
come about 
The Nashville production will pose a new challenge for the 
entertainer who earned 35 for her first performance in 1955 and 
eventually grew to such stature that she sang for the queen of 
England 
It will give me a chance to do some different things she 
says I thought Id fit into it well It will give me a chance to 
spread my wings a little 
Miss Lee will be seen this spring on a special musical 
production called Shake Rattle and Roll on the Public 
Broadcasting Service She recently appeared in a similar show 
Legendary Ladies on cable TVs Cinemax 
Her rollicking Rockin Around the Christmas Tree just 
enjoyed another holiday season and now has sold more than 6 million 
copies 
It feels a little strange when I sing it in July but thats 
all right she said 
Only her Im Sorry has more sales 10 million 
She professes to having no favorite hit but says Im Sorry 
has a special place because I believed in it so long before I 
recorded it But I liked all of the songs 
It bothers me to leave them out in concert because the 
people want to hear certain ones If they yell out a request I 
stop and do it and let the show go longer if I can 
Her other hits include Comin on Strong Sweet Nothins 
As Usual Fool Number One and Too Many Rivers 
Her Break It to Me Gently preceded a hit version by Juice 
Newton Similarly she had a hit with Always on My Mind before 
Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson recorded it 
She offers these comments on current female pop stars 
Madonna I like her Shes got a different style and a flair 
and shes her own person Shes courageous in what she does 
Whitney Houston Shes a very classy lady and a very good 
singer with roots in gospel music that show through Shes bringing 
back ballads and Im glad shes around to do that 
Cyndi Lauper She reminds me of me as far as her energy and 
singing I wasnt as wild or as way out as she may be but shes 
very energetic and unorthodox and I was that way She doesnt just 
stand there and sing and be pretty She jumps around and moves and 
sweats and gets close to the audience I like that 
Miss Lee who made her 19th tour of Japan in December says her 
love of performing has not dwindled since she was dubbed Little 
Miss Dynamite as a teenage entertainer nearly a quarter century 
ago 
Keeping up your zest for singing is not hard Its everything 
else getting there and the travel all the stuff that goes into 
it Singing is definitely the easy part she says 
I want to keep doing it because I love the business and I know 
how to do it Ive lasted because of the people whove bought the 
records and supported me and because of the DJs whove played my 
records 
Ive had so many thrills it would be hard to pick the top 
one she says When you sing for heads of state and queens 
have gold records and win awards its so hard to say one was the 
most exciting 
One of them was meeting gospel great Mahalia Jackson She 
was one of my idols along with Judy Garland and Sophie Tucker
