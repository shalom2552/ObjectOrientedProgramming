A smoldering shell was all that remained 
Saturday of the former High School for the Performing Arts which 
helped launch the careers of future stars and inspired the movie 
and TV series Fame 
The landmark structure was destroyed by an overnight fire that 
apparently started near a stage in a secondfloor auditorium But 
we dont know why said Pat Foley a battalion fire chief 
Al Pacino Liza Minnelli Eartha Kitt Suzanne Pleshette and 
Anna Maria Horsford who plays the ministers daughter on the TV 
series Amen are among the successes who studied there 
So excited because Im going to go to the High School of 
Performing Arts exclaims the character Diana Morales in the 
longrunning Broadway musical A Chorus Line 
Detailing the rigors of the school the character a native of 
sunny Puerto Rico sings about riding a makebelieve bobsled in 
class 
And Mr Karp turns to me and he says OK Morales what did you 
feel And I said Nothing Im feeling nothing And he says 
Nothing could get a girl transferred 
The performing arts school part of the public system was 
combined with the High School of Music and Art about three years 
ago and moved to a new home The old building became known as 
Liberty High School 
It was the original school that was used as a model for 
Fame Although the Board of Education did not permit film crews 
to shoot scenes inside the facade was featured in the 1980 film 
and subsequent television series 
The school had a very positive and very motivating 
reputation said dancer Paula Brown who appeared in the series 
for two years It made a lot of kids successful 
Working on Fame was like being in school I was 22 years old 
and I felt like I was 15 starting all over again said Ms 
Brown who currently is appearing in the new Spike Lee movie 
School Daze 
The school just north of the Times Square area in Manhattan 
caught fire about 1230 am and burned out of control for 5 
hours The third fourth and fifth floors and the rear portion of 
the roof collapsed 
Thirty firefighters struggling against a wind chill of minus 7 
and wind gusts of 28 miles an hour suffered minor injuries
