The Soviet Union has begun dismantling part of its 
intermediate range nuclear arsenal in East Germany the staterun 
news agency ADN reported Tuesday 
The step makes an important contribution toward disarmament 
even before a USSoviet treaty to eliminate the mediumrange 
missiles is ratified ADN said 
According to the report rockets stationed near Neubrandenburg 
north of Berlin have been dismantled crated and are ready for 
transport back to the Soviet Union 
ADN did not say how many had been dismantled or when the rockets 
will be transported back to the Soviet Union East German 
television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading missile crates onto 
transport vehicles 
The disarmament treaty was signed in Washington in December by 
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev but the 
US Senate has yet to ratify it The Supreme Soviet is expected to 
approve it 
Under the agreement the Soviets shorterrange missiles in East 
Germany and in Czechoslovakia are to be destroyed within 18 months 
and longerrange US and Soviet missiles within three years 
In Washington there was no immediate reaction at the State 
Department but a US official said the Soviets were free to 
dismantle the missiles before the treaty took effect 
The official who demanded anonymity said US inspectors will 
go to East Germany and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the 
Soviets were complying with the treaty 
West German government officials Tuesday night declined comment 
on the report 
There was no immediate comment in Moscow but Gorbachev on 
Tuesday criticized Western European countries for what he called a 
lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement to eliminate 
intermediaterange missiles 
In a report by the official Tass news agency Gorbachev 
criticized Western European governments for the latest wave of 
praise for the nuclear deterrence strategy all manner of 
projects for the joint manufacture of newest weapons the 
FrancoWest German military rapprochment and so forth 
ADN said Soviet soldiers are making the last preparations to 
return their SS12 rockets to the Soviet Union 
The rockets are shorterrange weapons included in the 
intermediate range missile pact which banned weapons with a range 
from 300 to 3000 miles 
The news agency quoted a Soviet officer as saying that the 
troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in 
our unit 
ADN said a group of East German journalists toured the missile 
base and were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers there 
The ADN report described preparations under way to ready the 
rockets for transport Cranes were used to load the dismantled 
rockets into transpot containers it said 
We were convinced that the last rockets were ready for 
transport to the location where they will be destroyed ADN said 
The rockets are to be sent back to the Soviet Union by rail the 
report said 
East German leader Erich Honecker in January indicated that 
Soviet intermediate range rockets stationed in East Germany could 
be removed ahead of schedule but gave no specific timetable for 
their withdrawal 
The ADN report did not say if other missiles stationed in East 
Germany had been dismantled or how many troops were scheduled to 
leave 
According to figures released after the superpower agreement was 
signed 22 rockets 12 launchers nine transport vehicles and seven 
practice missiles were stationed at the site which holds the 
largest numbers of SS12s in East Germany 
There are three other SS12 rocket sites in East Germany
