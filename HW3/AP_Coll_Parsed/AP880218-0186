President Reagan for only the second time in 
eight budgets asked Congress Thursday to increase spending on 
education with much of the extra 15 billion going to help 
students pay for college 
The administration also requested modest increases in several 
social programs including rental vouchers for lowincome families 
drug abuse prevention foster care and adoption assistance and 
prenatal care for pregnant women 
But some programs for the needy would suffer cuts under the 
proposal including a 400 million 25 percent cut in help for the 
poor to pay heating and cooling bills Head Start would be frozen 
at 12 billion and other social programs would be left with no 
increases or small ones lagging behind inflation 
The Department of Educations proposed 203 billion fiscal 1989 
budget is 15 billion or 8 percent higher than what it expects 
to spend this year The administration asked for budget authority 
of 212 billion fully 72 billion more than it sought for the 
department 12 months ago 
The proposed budget adds 590 million to the Pell Grant program 
for needy college and trade school students for a total of nearly 
5 billion and raises the maximum individual grant in 198990 to 
2300 a 100 increase Some 34 million students would receive 
grants that year up from an estimated 31 million this fall and 
29 million during the current academic year 
An additional 517 million would be spent on Chapter 1 the 
tutoring program for disadvantaged children at risk of academic 
failure bringing it up to nearly 44 billion to serve 56 million 
students 
The administration proposed modest expansions of magnet school 
drug education adult literacy and handicapped education programs 
and wants to increase college loans that tie repayments to future 
income levels 
It also asked for a college savings bond program widely 
supported in Congress with taxfree interest on US savings bonds 
used for postsecondary education 
Education Secretary William J Bennett asked to explain the 
budget reversal said Its pointless to waste time with a budget 
proposal which virtually no one in Congress takes seriously 
The administration has only requested education increases in 
1984 and 1988 both presidential election years Asked about the 
timing Bennett said We hope its good politics We think its 
sensible 
Despite the boosts in some areas Bennett said he expected the 
whineometer will still register among department critics He 
was not disappointed 
Albert Shanker president of the American Federation of 
Teachers said his union welcomed the administrations 
turnaround but said there are still many gaps in the 
presidents priorities 
Mary Hatwood Futrell president of the National Education 
Association derided the proposal as an electionyear ploy that 
does children no favors She said the program for students at 
risk serves 13 million fewer children than in 1980 and should be 
funded at 20 billion to reach all who need it 
Robert Greenstein director of the Center for Budget Priorities 
a liberal watchdog group said Its an improvement over previous 
Reagan budgets But he charged Reagan was inflicting cuts on 
programs for the needy to pay for a 29 percent boost in the space 
program 
In addition to the reduction in energy aid Greenstein cited 
proposed reductions in aid to soup kitchens food banks and shelter 
for the homeless lowincome rural housing legal services for the 
poor refugee assistance community development and community 
service block grants and housing assistance for the lowincome 
elderly and handicapped
