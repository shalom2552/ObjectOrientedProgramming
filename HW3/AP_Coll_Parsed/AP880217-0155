Riots in the occupied lands are only an 
hours drive from Tel Aviv but there are no outward signs that the 
unrest is dampening spirits in Israels entertainment capital 
On a recent Saturday night young couples crowded into the 
popular Cherrys Cafe and the decibels were as deadly as ever at 
the Cafe Dan discotheque which caters to the punk rock crowd 
Peoples daytoday life is not affected unless they have 
Arabs working for them I think a lot of people ignore the trouble 
because it seems far away said Rickie Gal a rock singer whose 
blond hair was streaked with a slash of red 
But sitting in a cafe on Dizengoff Street the center of Tel 
Avivs night life Ms Gal said she was recording her first 
political song to protest the violence It says Yes enough 
war and No to hate and the use of force 
Because Israel is about the size of Rhode Island little happens 
that is geographically remote Tel Aviv is only 50 miles from the 
Gaza Strip and 30 miles from Nablus the West Banks largest city 
The psychological distance is much greater because a large 
percentage of Israelis rarely if ever visit the occupied lands 
unless they are forced to by an army callup 
In contrast Jeruslemarea houses have had picture windows and 
windshields smashed by rioters and several private cars have been 
torched 
In neighborhood meetings Jewish residents have warned they will 
use guns if necessary to defend their homes if police are unable to 
do so 
Israelis in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area which has 15 
million Jews and about 10000 Arabs say they feel much less 
threatened than Israelis who live 45 minutes away in Jerusalem 
which borders the West Bank and has a onethird Arab population 
In Tel Aviv being so fully Jewish you never really feel 
events like this the way you do in Jerusalem There is a different 
feeling in the air People go on with their life as usual said 
Benny Cohen a spokesman for the city 
He said the mood was summed up in a current pop song by army 
singers from the Southern Command Band titled Tel Aviv Is Not 
Worried 
People are very aware of the situation and caught up in it 
but Jerusalem is a more political city By nature the ratio of 
politics to barroom conversations is lower in Tel Aviv than in 
Jerusalem said Zeev Chavets an Israeli author and immigrant 
from Pontiac Mich 
Tel Aviv residents have been called to reserve duty in the 
occupied areas just like other Israelis They employ some of the 
40000 Arabs who provide menial labor for Tel Aviv hotels 
restaurants construction sites and factories 
Frequent Arab strikes have affected city garbage collection 
More than half the 350 Arabs stayed home and several hundred Arab 
restaurant workers fled Tel Avivs restaurant district this week 
after being threatened 
Shaptai Bahar owner of the Hippopotame restaurant said six 
Arabs including both cooks went home after two Arab militants 
came to the kitchen and threatened to harm the workers families if 
they did not observe a boycott of Israeli businesses 
Tel Aviv is Israels intellectual capital and the uprising by 
Palestinian nationalists has spurred many to urge peace 
negotiations and an end to the use of force against the 15 million 
residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
The Association of Israeli Playwrights organized a gathering in 
the Tzavta theater Tuesday that drew widely known actors singers 
and authors including several who had not previously expressed 
their views publicly on the unrest 
The most difficult struggle is taking place in the minds of 
Israelis Its a struggle between emotions and reason Ely Sarid 
33 said during a debate with a group of young intellectuals and 
artists who gathered in his apartment 
Sarid a teacher of filmmaking who was a tank commander in the 
1973 Middle East war and has done reserve duty in the West Bank 
said the unrest has made him ready to challenge the authorities 
If I am called up I will go But I wont beat anyone or do 
anything to support the occupation he said If they put me in 
a tank I will aim the cannon outside the borders
