A joyrider who took four latemodel cars 
and trucks this week has earned the grudging respect of Beckleys 
finest 
The joyrider was brazen bold efficient and 11 years old 
Ive never seen anything like it said Patrolman Don Lilly 
He stole them like a pro 
Like many professionals the young suspect was a specialist All 
four of the stolen vehicles two Chevrolets a GMC and a Buick 
were General Motors products 
He said they were the easiest to steal Lilly said 
The technique in each theft was the same he said The boy broke 
the door locks then broke into the steering column to defeat the 
locking mechanism 
Then hed just start them up and drive off and all this in a 
matter of seconds Lilly said 
In quick succession Wednesday night police found two vehicles 
taken from a shopping center one from a mine service company and a 
fourth from a home 
Wed find one of the missing cars and another one would turn 
up nearby Lilly said It looks like he just drove them around 
parked them cranked up another one and took off 
Investigators found the boy through a combination of forensic 
evidence and a tip from a witness who saw the suspect near one of 
the vehicles 
I was taking fingerprints off of one of the Blazers and 
noticed they seemed awfully small Lilly said We started 
checking and every one of the seats was pushed up as far as it 
would go 
Officials contacted the nearest elementary school described the 
suspect and principal Walter Peelish led them to the boy 
I called his grandmother and she gave her permission for him 
to talk to the police Peelish said 
Peelish said the youth transferred to the school recently after 
moving from another state and had not been a difficult student 
A kids a kid and they all get a little rowdy but weve 
really had no problems with him he said 
Lilly said the boy admitted stealing the cars and gave police 
several tips on his methods 
The boy was released in his grandmothers custody pending 
juvenile court action He is charged with four counts of auto 
theft and one count of grand larceny for removing a stereo from 
one of the vehicles
