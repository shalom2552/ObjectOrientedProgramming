Hate crimes directed primarily at blacks and 
Jews rose to an eightyear record in the Los Angeles area during 
1987 according to a study that linked the increase to white power 
groups such as young neoNazi Skinheads 
A study released Wednesday by the County Commission on Human 
Relations cited entrenched racial and religious bigotry among a 
small segment of the Los Angeles County population as a reason 
for the increase 
The study recorded 184 incidents of racially or religiously 
motivated vandalism and violence last year the highest number 
since the commission began keeping statistics in 1980 
They included 79 incidents of racially motivated crimes 
compared to 58 in 1986 Antireligious crimes totaled 115 up from 
95 incidents in 1986 
More than half of the racially motivated crimes were aimed at 
blacks and 85 percent of all antireligious crimes were directed 
toward Jews the study found 
Our numbers for 1987 are the highest weve ever had and we 
dont think its a result of improved reporting Its real said 
Eugene Mornell the commissions executive director 
We also think there is an undercount of incidents 
particularly for Latinos and Asians he said 
The report acknowledged increases in open hategroup activity by 
the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party members and sympathizers including 
the rise of Skinheads youths who usually shave their heads as 
a symbol of their white supremacy beliefs 
Graffiti was the most common harassment but the commission 
documented cross burnings arson gunshots and other forms of 
violence and vandalism 
The studys findings were similar to a survey by the 
AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith which found antiSemitic 
violence is on the rise in Southern California and attributed the 
rise in part to the prevalance of Skinheads 
The annual report for the first time logged 52 cases of 
harassment against gays and lesbians out of 107 cases submitted to 
the commission in 1987 by the Gay and Lesbian Community Services 
Center
