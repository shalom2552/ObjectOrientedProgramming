The government accused foreign 
media Friday of a disinformation campaign and said a report that 
Ethiopian troops killed at least 20 civilians at a drought relief 
camp was unfounded 
Fanatics of one calling or another have in recent months tried 
to disrupt the relief distribution efforts and their accomplices 
continue to fabricate such unfounded allegations said the Relief 
and Rehabilitation Commission the government agency responsible 
for drought relief 
This latest unfounded report is just another instance the 
commission said in a statement 
Foreign relief sources in Ethiopia said Thursday that Ethiopian 
troops opened fire on thousands of drought victims when civilians 
resisted forced resettlement Twenty people were killed and many 
others wounded the sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
The sources said the shootings occurred Monday at the northern 
town of Korem in Tigray Province 525 miles north of the capital 
Addis Ababa 
No one in his right mind can imagine that any responsible 
person can commit such an atrocity against drought victims the 
commission said 
The commission said it had stated repeatedly that the 
resettlement program was voluntary 
Tigray and its northern neighbor Eritrea are the hardest hit 
by a drought that threatens more than 5 million Ethiopians with 
starvation Drought in the northern regions has been exacerbated by 
a civil war in Eritrea 
Ethiopias Marxist government began the resettlement program in 
November 1984 with a goal of moving 15 million people from the 
overpopulated droughtravaged north to unused fertile land in the 
south and west 
At least 600000 people were resettled before the government 
halted the program in February 1986 amid charges from the West that 
people were being forced to move sometimes at gunpoint Critics 
said the governments aim is to depopulate the north which is home 
to two rebel movements 
Ethiopia resumed resettlement Nov 25 promising the program 
would be voluntary and humane
