Thirty employers including some of the nations 
biggest corporations on Wednesday endorsed a 10point bill of 
rights on AIDS in the workplace formulated by a citizens group 
The companies committed themselves to taking an active role in 
educating their employees about AIDS and protecting job rights of 
AIDS sufferers 
Among the principles formulated by the Citizens Commission on 
AIDS for New York City and Northern New Jersey is a statement that 
people with AIDS or its virus are entitled to the same rights and 
opportunities as people with other serious or lifethreatening 
illnesses 
In addition it states AIDS victims do not pose a risk of 
transmission of the virus to coworkers through ordinary workplace 
contact 
Another principle is that employers should provide employees 
with sensitive accurate and uptodate education about risk 
reduction in their personal lives 
Requiring workers or job applicants take blood tests for the 
virus is specifically rejected as is divulging medical information 
about an employee 
IBM was the first company to endorse the principles said John 
Zucotti cochairman of the commission 
Others endorsing the principles included ATampT Time Inc 
Johnson amp Johnson WarnerLambert ITT Dow Jones Chemical Bank 
the City of New York and the teachers unions of New York City and 
Newark NJ 
Also United Jersey Banks Shubert Organization Times Mirror 
Co Atlantic Industries Ms Atlantic Sassy and US News and 
World Report magazines Rubenstein Associates Rockefeller Brothers 
Fund and the National Urban League 
Also the Girl Scouts Salvation Army Red Cross of Greater New 
York New Jersey A Philip Randolph Institute Lambda Legal Defense 
and Education Fund Fund for the City of New York Wildcat Services 
and Archie Comics 
Zucotti said the commission would pursue other employers and 
umbrella organizations of business and labor to endorse the 
principles 
A number of businesses have asked for time to study the 
principles and a few rejected them on grounds they might open 
themselves to lawsuits said Zucotti 
Zucotti declined to identify the rejecting companies but a 
commission member Thomas Stoddard executive director of the 
Lambda fund for gay rights said he thought the companies feared 
stigma more than lawsuits 
State and federal statues prohibit discrimination against people 
who have AIDS but can work so the principles require no more of a 
company legally than laws already on the books Stoddard said 
Those companies that have subscribed to these principles have 
been very courageous said Stoddard They have been willing to 
take the heat because they understand the gravity of the problem 
We will continue to have the problem of stigmatization until all 
companies subscribe to these principles 
Proposing and promoting the principles were the first public act 
of the 15member commission which was established in July and 
funded by 17 local foundations 
Zucotti said the commissions mission was to marshal information 
and mobilize effort to improve care for AIDS sufferers promote 
prevention and education about the fatal disease and address its 
social impact
