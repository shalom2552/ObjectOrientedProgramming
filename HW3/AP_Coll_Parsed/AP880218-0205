A federal judge on Wednesday upheld the 
governments refusal to grant a patent for an electrical motor 
which its inventor claims produces a net gain of energy but whose 
critics say violates a basic law of physics 
US District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found there was no 
valid scientific evidence to support inventor Joseph W Newmans 
claims that his device produced more energy than it consumed 
Jackson made his ruling on a 5yearold lawsuit against the US 
Patent and Trade Office which had refused to grant a patent after 
examiners determined that the machine did not do what Newman 
claimed it could do 
The Patent Office which didnt conduct tests ruled that Newman 
was seeking a patent for a perpetual motion machine a concept that 
violates the second law of thermodynamics 
The law of physics states that in any mechanical process some 
energy is inevitably lost usually in the form of heat so that 
output cannot exceed the input of energy 
The judge said Newman an inventor from Lucedale Miss 
produced evidence that was anecdotal and largely qualitative 
rather than quantified measured data to support his theory 
Jackson also found that Newman failed to rebut the findings of 
the National Bureau of Standards which tested the machine and 
found the device did not deliver more energy than it used 
Newman claims that his machine which largely resembles an 
ordinary electric motor except for an unusually large coil of wire 
converts what he calls gyroscopic particles into energy 
The 51yearold inventor has demonstrated his device to a Senate 
subcommittee and to news reporters in several cities 
Jackson found that aside from Newmans own somewhat 
metaphysical writings which appear at multiple points throughout 
his patent application there is no evidence whatsoever from 
which to find the existence of such gyroscopic particles their 
observable or measurable release or reaction within the 
device 
Newman and his attorney John Flannery said they expected to 
file an appeal of Jacksons decision to the US Circuit Court of 
Appeals here 
The procedure in the Patent Office was unfair and we think the 
testing procedure was unfair Flannery said referring to the 
tests conducted two years ago by the National Bureau of Standards 
Flannery contended that Jackson had improperly rejected the 
findings of former patent commissioner William Schuyler a 
courtappointed expert who reported there was clear evidence that 
Newmans device worked 
We have an expert who agrees with our view and we have a 
district court judges opinion that differs with that So I think 
we will have to go the Court of Appeals for a tiebreaker 
Flannery said 
Newman accused Jackson and patent officials of bias charging 
they knew his invention would hurt oil companies 
I am pleased the judge has finally ruled because I am counting 
on getting up to the higher court Newman said But I dont 
expect any justice from those people 
The often acrimonious court battle included an incident in 1986 
when Flannery was cited for contempt of court for pressing Newmans 
claim that Jackson recuse himself because he was appointed to the 
federal bench by President Reagan 
I have had just about enough of your insolence in this case 
the judge told Flannery Jackson later withdrew the contempt 
citation
