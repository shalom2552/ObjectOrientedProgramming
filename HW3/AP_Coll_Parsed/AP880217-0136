Vice President George Bush said today he will 
take nothing for granted as turns his attention to the South 
after his victory over chief rival Bob Dole in New Hampshires 
Republican presidential primary 
Bush thanking campaign workers at his national headquarters 
here also denied that he had distorted Doles record in the waning 
days of the New Hampshire campaign as Dole had charged Tuesday 
night I think I said it wasnt true but Ill be glad to say 
that he told reporters 
After spending today in Washington Bush heads Thursday to South 
Carolina Missouri and Texas three states among 20 that are 
holding presidential contests on Super Tuesday March 8 
The vice presidents strong New Hampshire showing Tuesday 
followed his third place finish in Iowa behind Dole and Pat 
Robertson 
Bush today steadfastly refused to discuss Doles charge that the 
vice president had made false statements about the Kansas senators 
record on such issues as the budget deficit and taxes 
You all want me to talk about Sen Dole I want to talk about 
the issues Bush said You want to talk about history I want 
to talk about the future 
Im not going to dwell on it you see I dont want to be 
drawn into something like that the vice president said 
Bush added People in New Hampshire like clean campaigns and 
they endorsed me overwhelmingly 
The system worked You can take them in the chin you can get 
up and you can fight again he said So now go on to Super 
Tuesday Were going to fight hard Were going to take nothing for 
granted Were going to take a positive message a message that 
was good in New Hampshire and is just as good elsewhere 
Were moving into a new dimension now said Lee Atwater 
Bushs national campaign manager The next big contest is Super 
Tuesday Seventy percent of the delegates you need to get the 
nomination are going to be chosen that one night 
Atwater said that whoever walks out of the Super Tuesday 
contests with the lions share of the delegates will win the 
Republican nomination 
George Bush has got a 31 lead on delegates now Atwater 
said Hes going to keep a 31 lead in delegates 
Bush told several hundred supporters jammed into a hotel 
ballroom that you havent chosen a man youve chosen a course 
to expand our prosperity to see that it touches every hamlet 
Youve chosen to back a strong America an America strong 
enough to bring peace to the entire world he added 
Bush said things had dramatically turned around in the last two 
days of the campaign and that he did a better job in getting his 
message out He also flew in a conservative hero former Sen Barry 
Goldwater of Arizona to help him gain votes 
Elections hinge on two things the candidates and the 
issues said Atwater We had the best candidate We had the 
only candidate talking about issues This leaves Dole as a loser 
here but I certainly wouldnt get overconfident Weve got a long 
campaign ahead of us
