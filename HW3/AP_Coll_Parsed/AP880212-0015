A court on Friday convicted fugitive guerrilla 
leader Abu Nidal and two of his Palestinian followers in the 1985 
grenade and rifle attack that killed 16 people in a crowd of 
holiday travelers at Romes airport 
Abu Nidal and another fugitive Rashid elHamieda were 
sentenced to life in prison The only defendant in custody Mahmoud 
Ibrahim Khaled was given a 30year term 
More than 80 people were injured in the Dec 27 1985 assault on 
the checkin counters of TWA and the Israeli carrier El Al at 
Leonardo da Vinci airport 
Four Americans were killed including an 11yearold girl on a 
trip with her family to New York 
ElHamieda described as a top lieutenant in Abu Nidals Fatah 
Revolutionary Council was accused along with Abu Nidal of 
organizing the attack Neither he nor Abu Nidal took part in it 
The assault occurred at the same hour as a similar strike at 
Viennas airport also blamed on Abu Nidals followers 
Four people including two terrorists and an American died in 
the Vienna attack and 47 people were injured Two surviving 
Palestinian terrorists were convicted of murder by a Vienna jury 
and sentenced to life in prison 
The Rome jury of two judges and six civilians apparently heeded 
a plea for leniency for Khaled the only survivor of the fourman 
commando team He could be released on parole in a little less than 
15 years 
Earlier in the day his courtappointed lawyer said he could not 
possibly ask for acquittal for the 20yearold Khaled who admitted 
his guilt 
Instead the lawyer Epifanio Ales reread for the jury Khaleds 
own statements about his childhood in a refugee camp in Lebanon 
his parents death in an Israeli bombing and his taking up of arms 
when he was 10 years old 
Khaled was a patriot who wanted a Palestine free of the 
Israelis Ales said in his plea for mercy 
The lawyer asked the jury to remember that Italian courts for 
years were merciful to men who had killed adulterous wives and 
their lovers under a now vanishing crime of honor standard 
Ales said defending the confessed terrorist was an anguished 
task and that it was particularly painful to listen to the 
testimony of an American journalist about how his daughter 
11yearold Natasha Simpson died in the gunfire 
Victor L Simpson news editor for The Associated Press in Rome 
described in court how he threw himself and the girl to the 
terminal floor in a futile attempt to shield her from the bullets 
According to the trial indictment four Israeli security guards 
fired back killing three of the four members of the attack squad 
and wounding Khaled 
The steelbarred holding cage for Khaled was empty on Friday He 
chose to stay in his prison cell exercising his right under 
Italian law not to attend his trial He only attended court Dec 
15 the trials opening session 
The trial was based largely on hours of pretrial statements by 
Khaled who told investigators that the terrorists were trained in 
Lebanons Syriancontrolled Bekaa Valley and took their orders from 
headquarters in Damascus the Syrian capital 
Investigators believed elHamieda provided the terrorists with 
their weapons and gave them final instructions during several 
meetings in Rome then checked out of a hotel and fled Italy at 
virtually the same hour the raid was launched 
Prosecutor Francesco Deleo had requested conviction and life 
sentences for the three defendants saying Khaleds statements made 
clear the airport strikes were linked to several terrorist attacks 
in Europe this decade 
Italy does not have capital punishment 
Abu Nidals group has been blamed for more than 100 attacks 
across Europe Asia and the Middle East since 1972 
He split from Yasser Arafats Palestine Liberation Organization 
in 1973 
An international arrest warrant has been issued for Abu Nidal 
whose real name is Sabri alBanna 
Abu Nidal is a nom de guerre which means father of the 
struggle 
He originally based his group in Syria but was expelled and is 
believed to operate out of Lebanon with his followers trained in 
Libya 
Lawyers for both fugitive defendants asked the jury for 
acquittal for lack of evidence They said they would appeal the 
verdict 
Khaleds lawyer said he had not yet decided about an appeal 
All three defendants were charged with massacre and with illegal 
possession of arms
