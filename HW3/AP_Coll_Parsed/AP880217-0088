Bob Dole beaten back by George Bush in the 
New Hampshire Republican primary today renewed his allegations 
that the vice president had distorted his record and promised to 
counterattack while Jack Kemp said he could unite the GOPs 
conservative wing 
From top to bottom the 1988 Republican presidential race was as 
hot and furious after the New Hampshire primary as it had been 
before No one talked of withdrawal and all looked south for new 
battles 
For his part Bush denied that his campaign had distorted Doles 
record 
Im sorry he feels that way the vice president said in an 
interview aired today on CBS 
Interviewed on ABCs Good Morning America Dole said the 
Bush camp first tried character assassination in Iowa 
That didnt work he said so they start on distorting 
your record Unless they want to get back on the straight and 
narrow and withdraw some of their attacks were going to have to 
counterattack 
Kemp said that although he finished third overall in New 
Hampshires GOP contest he was first among the conservatives And 
he said he could bridge the gap between the conservative wing 
and Pat Robertsons evangelical Christian wing 
Kemp was crowing because he finished ahead of former Delaware 
Gov Pete du Pont and Robertson a former television evangelist A 
week ago he finished a weak fourth in Iowa while Robertson was 
second 
In the firstinthenation balloting here were the numbers at 
the end of the counting Bush 39 percent and Dole 29 percent 
Kemp had 13 percent du Pont 10 percent and Robertson 10 
percent 
Alexander Haig who dropped out of the race Friday got less 
than 1 percent 
Bush Dole and Kemp were slated to be in Washington today while 
du Pont headed for Wilmington Del 
Robertson was campaigning in South Carolina and Florida two 
Southern states where he hopes to win a few primaries early next 
month 
Tomorrow morning we go into the South and theyre going to be 
playing in my backyard Robertson said Im throwing the 
gauntlet down to Bob Dole and George Bush South Carolina is the 
first Super Tuesday state and Im going to beat you there 
convincingly 
South Carolina holds a Republican primary on March 5 three days 
before the Super Tuesday megaprimary on March 8 
Du Pont who won the endorsement of the Union Leader of 
Manchester but did not turn that into a victory vowed to press on 
Im going southwithout question he said We did much 
better in New Hampshire than we did in Iowa Well do much better 
in the south than we did in New HampshireThe point is weve all 
finished together probably within a half point of each other 
Bush expressed heartfelt thanks to New Hampshire Republicans 
whom he told a week ago Im one of you 
Thank you New Hampshire Bush said On to the South 
where were going to rise again 
The battling to get into place for Super Tuesday when 16 
states will hold Republican events began even before the tally 
was finished in the Granite State 
Dole was being interviewed by NBCs Tom Brokaw when the 
anchorman turned and asked if Dole had anything to say to Bush 
Yeah quit lying about my record Dole said testily 
Dole said Bushs ads that claimed Dole wants to raise taxes just 
arent true 
I dont mind being attacked on my record when we have a 
difference but to just right out flat out distort the record 
then I think we need to call attention to that Dole said Its 
unfortunate that the vice president of the United States who knows 
better would sink to that level 
Asked later about the Dole remark Bush said I dont know 
what hes talking about 
If it hadnt been for the distortion of my positions on tax 
increases and an oil import fee Id be 10 points ahead Dole 
added 
Dole had been riding a wave out of his Iowa win a week ago 
Monday rising to as much as an eightpoint lead over Bush in some 
overnight polls 
But Bush and his campaign did an aboutface in the middle of the 
week dropping the formal campaign style launching the attacks on 
Doles record and talking a lot about himself and his own feelings 
Bush was also helped by President Reagans popularity in New 
Hampshire In Iowa where the administration is blamed for economic 
woes his White House tie was a liability 
And at the end of the week Bush brought in conservative hero 
Barry Goldwater to polish his conservative credentials And he 
stood on the stage with baseball hero Ted Williams adding a 
celebrity sheen in a state that watched Williams perform miracles 
for the Boston Red Sox
