Here is the text of President Reagans radio 
address Saturday which was prerecorded on Thursday 
My fellow Americans today I am meeting with Mexican President 
Miguel de la Madrid in Mazatlan Mexico so Ive prerecorded 
this radio talk Over these last seven years maintaining a 
constructive and friendly relationship with our neighbors to the 
south has been one of the highest priorities of our administration 
As we review what has transpired there is every reason to be 
pleased The leaders of our two nations are aware that good 
relations and cooperation between us are invaluable to both our 
peoples And thats why the meetings between our top leadership 
have been frequent and our talks at those meeting comprehensive 
My meeting today with President de la Madrid will cover a number 
of issues from economic concerns to our mutual commitment to 
fight drug traffickers to the security challenges facing the 
hemisphere 
Mexico is our fourth largest trading partner and we 
correspondingly are Mexicos largest trading partner Our 
commercial ties are strong and of great benefit to people on both 
sides of the border Weve worked hard to make it that way Last 
November we signed a new frameword understanding that underscored 
our special trade and investment relationship 
During our meetings in Mazatlan President de la Madrid and I 
will reaffirm our commitment to take advantage of every opportunity 
to strengthen the commercial ties between our peoples One thing 
that cannot be overemphasized is that a healthy and expanding 
Mexican economy is in the interest of the United States We want 
Mexico to grow and prosper And thats why weve done our best and 
will continue to do our best to help find solutions to the vexing 
problems of Mexicos international debt 
Innovative marketbased methods of managing this burden are 
being explored such as Mexicos offer to exchange debt for 
longterm bonds At the same time weve been working with our 
Mexican counterparts on such things as a new textile accord a 
telecommunications agreement and a new civil aviation agreement 
which is in the final stages of negotiations 
I hope that one day all of this will be seen as the initial 
steps leading toward an historic freeing of commerce and trade 
throughout the continent Were just now beginning to tap the 
unmeasurable potential between Mexico and the United States 
This can certainly be seen in the Immigration Reform and Control 
Act passed by Congress in 1986 This law offers protections for 
more than a million undocumented immigrants living in the United 
States many of whom are from Mexico It provides a means for them 
to find legal employment in our country and to participate openly 
and freely in our society 
Population movement and employment are subjects being examined 
closely by joint US and Mexican commissions A study of the issues 
and frank dialogue between us is essential and I am gratified by 
the responsible longterm approach the Mexican government is taking 
in this sensitive area We have found that there are honest and 
concerned officials on both sides of the border who are dedicated 
to the same ideals 
Nowhere is that more clear than in the battle against drug 
traffickers American and Mexican policemen and law enforcement 
officials have lost their lives in this fight Weve been allies 
with brave individuals men and women of integrity who are putting 
their lives on the line against this evil and the corruption and 
bloodshed that follows in its trail 
I might add that each and every one of us can make a 
contribution to winning this war against drugs first by refusing 
to use illegal drugs ourselves and second by helping others to 
get off drugs and the traffickers would go out of business if 
people quit buying illegal drugs Thats the real solution and 
its up to each and every one of us to be a part of the solution 
Finally my talks with President de la Madrid will also cover 
the security threat to this hemisphere Since 1980 weve witnessed 
an impressive expansion of democracy throughout the Americas 
However this progress cannot be taken for granted The 
establishment of totalitarian regimes supported by Cuba and the 
Soviet Union is a threat to stability and freedom Nowhere is that 
threat more acute than in Central America 
I would hope that the United States and Mexico will find common 
interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat The peoples and 
governments of the United States and Mexico are and ought to be 
friends Our national interests dictate it our peoples demand it 
It is in this spirit that I meet today with President de la Madrid 
I will pass on to the people of Mexico your very best wishes 
Until next week thanks for listening and God bless you
