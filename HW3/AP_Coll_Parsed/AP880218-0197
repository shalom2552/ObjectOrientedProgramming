Heart transplantation probably has reached 
its peak because of a nationwide shortage of donor organs and that 
may force doctors to reevaluate the use of temporary artificial 
hearts prominent surgeons said Thursday 
Because of complications related to their longterm use 
artificial hearts have been used in the past few years strictly to 
keep patients alive pending the receipt of donor hearts 
But at an openingday session of a conference on thoracic organ 
transplantation surgeons discussed the possibility that use of the 
devices as bridges may have to be reconsidered 
I think the artificial heart business and circulatory support 
business is going to become more esoteric until such time as we 
have a totally implantable permanent device to put in said Dr 
Jack G Copeland of the University of Arizona Heart Center a 
cosponsor of the conference with the Minneapolis Heart Institute 
Copeland said using a bridge to transplant is much less 
appealing in my mind with the donor shortage and many patients 
sitting around waiting would be better candidates for transplant if 
theres one organ available and too many waiting for it So I think 
its going to be less common 
Nearly 200 surgeons and other medical practitioners attended the 
opening session which covered a range of topics on heart 
heartlung and lung transplantation 
One of them Dr William A Baumgartner of Johns Hopkins 
University cited a recent study predicting a limit of about 1500 
heart donors annually and said I think that we have proabably 
reached the zenith of heart transplant donors at least for the 
forseeable future 
Baumgartner last year performed a domino donor transplant 
implanting a heart and lung into a cystic fibrosis patient whose 
own heart was transplanted into a second patient The first patient 
received organs donated by a braindead patient 
Dr Frazier Eales of the Minneapolis Heart Institute said We 
dilute the credibility of our programs if we have 100 people on the 
waiting list and all we can do is 15 or 20 transplants a year 
A number of surgeons said there has been a falloff in the number 
of heart transplants performed so far in 1988 compared with 1987 
but could give no explanation 
Were used to seeing a great deal of variation Eales said 
But this has been prolonged and its evidently been nationwide 
Dr Lyle D Joyce a cardiovascular surgeon from the Minneapolis 
center and an expert on the Jarvik artificial heart while agreeing 
the donor shortage is a real problem said he disagreed with 
the idea that perhaps we shouldnt even consider using the device 
as a bridge to transplant 
We are at a point in the development of these devices that we 
need some experience and there is a price were going to have to 
pay including losing some patients he said 
He said if not for having moved ahead with such experimental 
implants as Barney Clarks I would daresay that there would be 
no research going on on a national scale today to develop a total 
artificial heart 
But he added that the National Institutes of Health has provided 
20 million a year for such development and predicted a totally 
implantable device in the near future 
Joyce who worked with Dr William DeVries in the early 
permanent Jarvik implants said the time may be approaching for a 
return to permanent artificial hearts 
He said the donor shortage likely will force transplant programs 
to reject older patients as lessthanperfect candidates in turn 
again making available a pool of candidates for permanent implants
