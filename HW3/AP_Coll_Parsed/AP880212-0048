The Marine Corps and the State Department on 
Friday minimized a report that more than 500 instances of possible 
wrongdoing by Marine guards at embassies worldwide had not been 
investigated properly 
Many of the socalled infractions were very minor such as 
curfew violations insubordination and misuse of telephone that 
could have no conceivable tie to suspected KGB activity the 
corps said in a statement The KGB is the Soviet spy agency 
Both agencies responded to Rep Dan Micas statement that more 
than 500 reports of infractions by Marines at embassies had 
remained in the State Departments files until recently 
Mica DFla said the reports which dealt with black market 
activities or fraternization with Soviets are supposed to be 
turned over to the Naval Investigative Service for further 
investigation 
Mica said his information came from the General Accounting 
Office the congressional watchdog agency which began looking into 
security at the embassies in the wake of allegations of espionage 
at the Moscow embassy 
The KGB often encourages people to engage in illegal behavior as 
a first step to gaining cooperation with the Soviets Mica said 
A State Department official speaking on condition he remain 
anonymous said the decision to turn over information about a 
possible violation by a Marine guard is sometimes made by the 
Marines sometimes by the department 
There have been instances where one or both passed along 
information to the NIS the official said The removal of a Marine 
is also a joint decision he said 
Asked about the 578 reports referred to by Mica the corps said 
The report is actually a listing of the Marine security guards 
whose tours of duty as embassy guards were cut short for a variety 
of reasons during the period 19801987 
Some Marines were removed for disciplinary reasons others for 
medical reasons or for giving a substandard performance the 
statement said 
Of the security guards sent home between 19851987 only a 
handful could be said to relate to espionage During that period 
only one Marine Sgt Clayton Lonetree has been convicted of 
espionage for his activities in Moscow 
The Marines said they had not known about the list of 578 until 
June 1987 when it surfaced at the Department of State 
Mica was not available to comment because he is in Florida 
preparing to announce his candidacy for US Senate But his 
spokesman John Gersuk said infractions on the list could have 
been things other than black marketeering or fraternization 
violations 
Mica has said the various agencies procedures for handling 
potential security problems are chaotic and may need to be 
overhauled
