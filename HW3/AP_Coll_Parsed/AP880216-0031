Thousands of Mardi Gras revelers thronged the 
French Quarter today for Americas biggest block party where 
madness is a way of life and the only sin is to be a party pooper 
Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday was the crescendo of two weeks of 
nightly preLenten Carnival parades in The City That Care Forgot 
As early as noon Monday the lines were a half block long 
outside Pat OBriens bar a popular watering hole in the Quarter 
and the nonstop party was just getting started Narrow streets of 
the citys old section were wall to wall with revelers 
As the party grew jazz and fireworks heralded the arrival of a 
costumed standin for Rex the King of Carnival who disembarked 
from a Coast Guard cutter at the Riverwalk shopping mall on the 
Mississippi River just outside the Quarter 
By midnight George Moore and his friend Don Granda both from 
St Louis were getting into the swing of things at Mollys Pub a 
crowded bar on the Quarters river edge Moore said it was his 15th 
Mardi Gras 
This has always been my second home he said Last year 
was great and were hoping good weather will make this one just as 
good If it is Ill need five days to sleep when I get back to St 
Louis 
The first of 17 organizations scheduled to take to the streets 
today was jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain and his Half Fast Marching 
Club preceding the real Rex along a route winding past the stately 
homes of the Garden District to Canal Street in the central 
business district on the edge of the Quarter 
In the Quarter women on wroughtiron balconies often bare their 
breasts and gay bars play host to male crossdressers barely clad 
in various combinations of womens underwear hosiery high heels 
feathered headresses and beaded gowns 
Todays crowds could surpass the estimated 1 million people that 
jammed metropolitan area streets last year said police spokesman 
John Marie 
The day officially concludes at midnight tonight with the 
meetings of the courts of Rex and Comus signaling that Mardi Gras 
has given way to Ash Wednesday and 40 days of Lenten sacrifice 
Last year police were criticized for clearing the streets after 
Mardi Gras with a little too much vigor Assistant Police Chief Ray 
Holman said officers will be more gentle this year but no less 
insistent 
In nine days preceding the 1988 celebration police had made 
1434 arrests 79 fewer than last year a police spokesman said 
In Mamou 160 miles west in the heart of Cajun country Mardi 
Gras is celebrated but in a different way 
As many as 20000 visitors were expected to turn out in the town 
of 3200 for Courir du Mardi Gras or The Running of the Mardi 
Gras in which masked horsemen canter from house to house 
soliciting the makings of a giant gumbo At dinner time those 
still in the saddle gallop into town to toss their gleanings into 
the pot 
The Cajun country towns of Eunice Lawtell and Ville Platte also 
celebrate Courir du Mardi Gras but Mamous celebration is the 
biggest
