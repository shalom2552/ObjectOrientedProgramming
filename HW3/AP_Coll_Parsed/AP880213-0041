One day last year every person on Earth was 
bombarded with 10000 billion ghostly particles called neutrinos 
hurled into space by the explosion of a star an astronomer said 
However neutrinos are so incredibly small and elusive that they 
passed through buildings people and the Earth itself with barely a 
trace Besides said Boston University astronomer Larry Sulak We 
are recycled star dust 
The neutrinos are the remnants of a supernova an exploding 
star that suddenly appeared almost a year ago in the skies of the 
Southern Hemisphere 
Such explosions happen regularly but this one was in the Large 
Magellanic Cloud a galaxy 1 million trillion miles away which is 
close by heavenly standards It is the brightest from an earthly 
perspective in 383 years 
Scientists who have spent the past year studying the supernova 
discussed their findings Friday at a meeting of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science 
John Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton 
NJ said that last Feb 23 every human on Earth was showered 
with about 10000 billion neutrinos from the exploding star 
However people are constantly bombarded with neutrinos from our 
own sun as well and the added dose did no harm 
Only 1 in 10000 had as much as a single hydrogen atom changed 
by the neutrinos Bahcall said 
The subatomic particles have almost zero mass and no charge 
He said the supernova explosion was the equivalent of about one 
million billion billion billion atomic bombs of the kind that 
destroyed Hiroshima Thats more energy than a hundred stars 
shining like the Earths sun would give off in light over the 
lifetime of the universe 
Scientists at the conference said they were surprised and 
delighted that the supernova acted almost exactly like their 
theories said it would 
It was expected to make neutrinos and it did right on 
schedule said J Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas in 
Austin The basic predictions have come to pass with this 
supernova 
The researchers said that when the star blew up 99 percent of 
its exploding energy was released in the form of neutrinos while 
most of the rest was light The neutrinos reached Earth three hours 
before the light That light spotted from a mountain top in Chile 
last Feb 24 was the first sign for astronomers of the celestial 
catastrophe 
Later though scientists found traces of the sudden burst of 
neutrinos in two huge vats of water one in the United States and 
one in Japan 
Sulak operates the US experiment a square tank of water five 
stories high that sits in a salt mine beneath Lake Erie The tank 
was built for another purpose witnessing the death of protons 
but it also showed that eight neutrinos from the supernova had 
collided with water molecules The Japanese tank recorded 11 such 
collisions 
The experts believe that nickel was formed during the initial 
explosion This decayed in about five days to form radioactive 
cobalt which in turn more slowly breaks down to make iron The 
cobalt gives off both light and gamma rays 
Robert P Kirshner of the HarvardSmithsonian Center for 
Astrophysics said the steady dimming of the supernova has recently 
begun to accelerate This is because it is spewing out more of its 
energy as gamma rays and less as light However the destroyed star 
is still visible with binoculars 
Supernovas are important to people because they are the source 
of many elements that are essential to life 
This is the death of a star said Kirshner This is the 
place where the elements are made The calcium in your bones was 
made in a supernova explosion
