It looks like an ordinary set of false teeth 
but its mounted in something that looks like a machineshop drill 
press 
It doesnt look like an artificial mouth but it works like 
one said Dr William Douglas who directs the Artificial 
Resynthesis Technology study at the University of Minnesota 
Scientists are using a pair of the bulky machines the only ones 
of their kind to test dental products and conduct other kinds of 
research 
Douglas and his colleagues can duplicate the rigors of a year of 
chewing in a single day That he says offers hope for vast 
improvement in the quality of dental fillings and crowns and in 
scientists ability to understand the forces of chewing and 
digestion 
Without the new technology Douglas explains manufacturers must 
test and prove the durability of their wares in the mouths of real 
subjects Years of grinding and chomping must go by before 
researchers can judge a products merit 
If you put this together you have an investigative tool 
said Douglas 50 who left a research post in Wales to do research 
at the university 
If you have an obedient artificial mouth which is believable 
you have something to enable you to approach many tough problems 
that otherwise would be very difficult to do 
The mouth began taking shape when Douglas joined the dental 
research staff at Minnesota in 1978 His endowed chair is partly 
funded by 3M Co based in the St Paul suburb of Maplewood 3M is 
a leading manufacturer of fillings crowns and other dental 
products 
Douglas soon learned of a company MTS Systems Corp in 
suburban Eden Prairie that builds test equipment with the precision 
and sophistication he needed to replicate mouth dynamics in the 
laboratory 
Along with colleagues Ralph DeLong and RL Sakaguchi Douglas 
adapted MTS equipment to build the mechanical mouths 
The next step was artificial saliva A researcher at State 
University of New York at Buffalo has learned how to make it and 
he sends Douglas and company quantities to use with the mouth Jets 
shoot the saliva and other lubricants between test teeth the way 
ducts do in real life 
Along with the mouth the dental researchers have developed 
computer imaging technology that maps precisely where and how teeth 
wear out 
Its a very painstaking procedure right now where youre 
marking on teeth and measuring them said Walter Poxon 
international professional services manager for 3M This computer 
imaging is the state of the art in dental materials research It 
really does give you an accurate picture of whats happening 
Douglas has other more ambitious dreams for his mouth Now it 
chews only in the sense that it simulates the wearandtear of 
chewing He wants it to masticate fully to grind break down and 
even swallow food 
The next step development of artificial tongues and cheeks 
Douglas is poring over scientific papers for background while he 
prepares applications for National Institute of Health grants to 
finance more work in that direction 
I want to figure out how this thing can give a good simulation 
of what happens in the human mouth For that you need a tongue and 
cheek mechanism Douglas said Its very tough Its a very 
difficult thing to do 
Douglas sees a complete artificial mouth as a research tool for 
foodproduct development a field in which tenderness texture and 
mouth feel possess tremendous importance The artificial mouth 
would be able to quantify precisely the oral effort Product X would 
demand of the consumer 
You have an instrument that can figure out just how much 
mastication has to go into that beef he said
