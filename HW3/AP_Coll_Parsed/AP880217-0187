A Japaneseowned auto carrier ran aground 
in the Persian Gulf on Wednesday and although there were initial 
fears it had struck a mine divers determined it had only scraped 
its bottom 
Iran meanwhile reacted to the announced cutback in US naval 
forces in the region by saying the move represented a defeat for 
American militaristic policy 
At a news conference Assistant Defense Secretary Richard 
Armitage confirmed that the battleship Iowa and two escort vessels 
had left the Arabian Sea in recent days and the helicopter carrier 
Okinawa was about to depart from the gulf 
Tehran radio monitored in London said the pullout showed the 
ineffectiveness of Washingtons policies in the Persian Gulf 
and the disgraceful defeat of futile military moves carried out in 
support of the Iraqi regime and reactionary Arab countries and in 
the form of direct action against Irans Islamic revolution 
It said Washington was searching for a way to withdraw without 
losing face for itself or its European allies a reference to the 
five countries that joined last years buildup of forces to protect 
commercial shipping from Iranian mines and attacks 
The 4842ton motor vessel Prosper World was heading out of the 
gulf after delivering a cargo of new cars when it ran aground 
Initial reports from shipping sources in Dubai quoted the 
captain of the Liberianflag ship as reporting an explosion and oil 
leak Lloyds Shipping Intelligence Unit in London later said 
flatly that the Prosper World had hit a mine 12 miles off the 
coast 
Divers who inspected the ship informed its captain a South 
Korean that he had just run aground and the whole bottom plate 
was wrinkled 
The ship owned by the Masumoto Shipping Company of Hyogo 
Japan was believed in no danger and was heading for a drydock for 
further inspection and repairs the sources said 
No vessel is reported to have struck a mine in the Persian Gulf 
since the small ocean survey ship Marissa I flying the Panamanian 
flag was blown up off Saudi Arabia on Sept 4 Four crew members 
died 
Since then senior officers of the United States and other 
Western navies have declared the threat from mines sown by Iran 
under control and have ordered a reduction in the number of 
minehunting vessels in the gulf 
Armitage in his meeting with reporters disclosed that Iran 
for the first time in recent memory had used one of its 
USsupplied F14 Tomcats in a combat role shooting down an Iraqi 
fighterbomber with an Americanmade Sidewinder missile Previous 
F14 activity had been limited to reconnaissance he said 
The F14 was one of 10 remaining from the late Shah Mohammad 
Reza Pahlavis air force Armitage gave no details but it 
apparently was involved in a dogfight on Feb 8 when Iran claimed 
it shot down three Iraqi jets
