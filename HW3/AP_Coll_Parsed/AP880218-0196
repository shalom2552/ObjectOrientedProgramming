Communist Party leaders Thursday dropped Boris N 
Yeltsin the outspoken former Moscow party chief from the ruling 
Politburo and promoted officials charged with reforming economic 
planning and party personnel 
Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev in a speech to the Communist 
Party Central Committee also said a party conference in June would 
be called on to adopt major political reforms ensuring the rule of 
law over personal will 
He said the Central Committee should devote a future session to 
the problems of the countrys more than 100 nationalities Ethnic 
groups in the Baltic republics and elsewhere have been agitating 
for greater autonomy or outright independence 
The official Tass news agency announced the leadership changes 
at the end of a twoday meeting of about 300 members of the 
policymaking Central Committee in Moscow The committee also 
adopted major educational reforms 
The Central Committee freed Comrade BN Yeltsin from his 
duties as a candidate member of the Politburo Tass said 
Georgy Razumovsky 52 and Yuri D Maslyukov 50 were named 
candidates or nonvoting members of the Politburo 
For the past two years Razumovskya a Gorbachev protege has 
been a secretary of the Central Committee in charge of appointing 
party personnel Maslyukov was named this month to head the State 
Planning Committee the government body in charge of planning the 
staterun economy 
Yeltsin supported Gorbachevs policy of greater openness but his 
criticism apparently went farther than Gorbachev was willing to 
allow 
On Nov 11 Gorbachev ousted the strapping 57yearold Yeltsin 
from his position as Moscow party leader At the last meeting of 
the Central Committee on Oct 21 Yeltsin criticized the pace of 
reform and the leadership style of the Communist Party He had 
offered to quit 
Yeltsin was transferred to first deputy director of the State 
Construction Committee with the rank of government minister 
Yeltsins fate was seen as a test by many in Moscow of how far 
Gorbachev would carry his policy of allowing greater openness and 
differences of opinion 
Gorbachev said last January it was a delusion to view 
Yeltsins dismissal as a blow to his restructuring policies He 
said Yeltsin was overly ambitious 
The Soviet leader gave the clearest indication yet of the 
problems he wants to attack at the party conference the first 
since the 1940s 
He said he intends to reform not replace the present system 
and that the dominance of the Communist Party is not in question 
The main problem in developing our political system is to 
create a mechanism of power and government which would 
drastically diminish and even reduce to naught the element of 
chance in handling major political state issues and preclude the 
possibility of subjectivity at all floors of our political 
system he said 
Subjectivity was an apparent reference to the personal wills 
of earlier Soviet leaders such as dictator Josef V Stalin and 
Nikita S Khrushchev 
Gorbachev called for strengthening the electoral system local 
governing councils and the Supreme Soviet the nominal parliament 
He called for a sharper distinction between the role of government 
organizations and party groups but provided no details 
The Central Committee the only body empowered to make changes 
in the ruling Politburo did not touch the list of 13 full voting 
Politburo members 
Razumovskys appointment was a clear victory for Gorbachev 
Gorbachev must have an ally in charge of appointing party 
personnel in order to overcome the resistance to his reforms in 
many layers of the vast Soviet bureaucracy 
Maslyukov a defense industry expert replaced Nikolai V 
Talyzin who had been criticized by Gorbachev Talyzin was shunted 
to chairmanship of a littleknown government commission but kept 
his candidate status on the Politburo 
Oleg D Baklanov 55 minister of general machine building was 
chosen to become a secretary of the Central Committee 
Gorbachev told the Central Committee the country faces a most 
serious financial problem 
He said a drop in world commodity prices and the loss of income 
from alcohol sales due to his campaign against drunkenness had hurt 
the Soviet economy The Soviet Union depends on oil and natural gas 
for a substantial percentage of its export income 
He said the top priority is improving food housing and consumer 
goods and said his policies have made progress in those areas 
Gorbachev rejected claims that his reforms are pulling the 
Soviet Union away from socialism At the same time he defended his 
policy of glasnost or greater openness and criticized the 
mistakes of former leaders Stalin Khrushchev and Leonid I 
Brezhnev 
Gorbachev reiterated Soviet criticism of US conservatives and 
some European leaders for urging the Western alliance to upgrade 
its weapons systems to make up for US missiles that will be 
withdrawn from Europe 
Regarding Afghanistan Gorbachev said the war there long had a 
direct and deep impact on the feelings of Soviet people He 
said he had been seeking a way out of Afghanistan since he took 
power almost three years ago 
Gorbachev said Feb 8 the estimated 115000 Soviet soldiers 
could be pulled out in a 10month period beginning May 15 if 
UNsponsored talks can reach an agreement
