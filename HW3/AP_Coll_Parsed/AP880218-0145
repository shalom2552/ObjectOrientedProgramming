A House committee on Thursday approved a 
resolution accusing North Korea of murderous acts of 
statesponsored terrorism for the bombing last year of a South 
Korean jetliner that killed 115 people aboard 
The Foreign Affairs Committee which passed the resolution 
without dissent also urged other nations to impose a trade embargo 
on North Korea The resolution was sent to the full House with 
strong statements of bipartisan support 
Rep Robert Lagomarsino RCalif said the destruction of 
Korean Air Lines Flight 858 last November was probably the 
clearest example we have seen of statesponsored terrorism 
Rep Stephen Solarz DNY called the bombing a monstrous act 
that raises doubt about the sanity of the heavilyarmed North 
Korean regime bordering USallied South Korea 
The resolution said that Congress categorically rejects the 
December 1987 proposal to enter into a dialogue with the Parliament 
of North Korea since its members represent a government that 
engages in murderous acts of statesupported terrorism 
Prior to the bombing Soviet diplomats had discussed a proposal 
for talks between US and North Korean lawmakers The discussions 
were later proposed in formal letters relayed by the Soviet Embassy 
to US officials in December according to a congressional 
staffer who requested anonymity 
Solarz said the United States has fairly persuasive 
independent evidence of North Korean responsibility for the 
timebombing In addition Kim Hyunhee surviving member of the 
two accused North Korean agents confessed to South Korean 
investigators 
The two left Flight 868 at Baghdad its last stop before the 
bombing over the Andaman Sea and took cyanide pills when later 
arrested in Bahrain 
The resolution expressed support for steps taken by the Reagan 
administration after the bombing including the addition of North 
Korea to its list of countries supporting international terrorism 
The resolution asked for sanctions and other measures against 
North Korea from other countries particularly with close 
relations with North Korea This was considered a reference to 
the Soviet Union and China North Koreas closest neighbors
