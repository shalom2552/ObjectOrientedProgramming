A federal judge Monday temporarily barred 
enforcement of a new federal rule that prevents federally funded 
family planning clinics from advising pregnant women on abortion 
The ruling applies to three organizations in Colorado and Utah that 
brought suit 
US District Court Judge Zita L Weinshienk granted the motion 
by the three birth control services groups seeking a preliminary 
injuction against the new rule scheduled to go into effect March 3 
The order just says the government cannot put these 
regulations into effect until we have a chance to hear it in a 
final hearing Weinshienk told The Associated Press 
The judge said she expected new hearing dates to be set within a 
week She also said two other similar cases are before federal 
judges in Boston and New York 
Filing the suit against the government were Rocky Mountain 
Planned Parenthood based in Denver Planned Parenthood of Utah and 
the Boulder Womens Health Clinic The ruling temporarily barring 
enforcement of the rule applies only to those three organizations 
Weinshienk said 
The suit claims new federal ruling violates the Federal Title X 
statute and the intent of Congress censors free speech rights at 
family planning clinics and violates the right of privacy of 
clinics and their patients 
The Department of Health and Human Services had ruled that 
beginning March 3 family planning programs receiving federal funds 
could not provide pregnant women with information on abortion or 
refer them to other sources even if they ask 
Administration officials have said the rule is intended to make 
sure federal funds are not used to promote abortion even 
indirectly 
Weinshienk said she based her decision on many US Supreme 
Court rulings that said there could not be rules that dictated to 
doctors what they say to patients which is what the regulations 
attempted to do 
Based on that finding and the fact that all of these cases 
indicated that such attempted regulation was unconstitutional I 
found irreparable injury The last two prongs for such a 
preliminary injunction are a balancing of harms to the plaintiff 
and against harms to the defendant the judge said 
The order will be in writing and out by the end of the week she 
said 
The judge said she made the ruling on a holiday Presidents 
Day because it was the only date when the two sides and she could 
get together 
The government wanted it heard as soon as possible The 
plaintiffs wanted it heard before the regs regulations went 
into effect on March 3 I said fine if you want to come in on a 
holiday I will too Weinshienk said
