City Park in New Orleans is a marvelous place 
Its Museum of Art Friday framed a new face 
Not a Mondrian modern or unknown Jurassic 
Not Van Gogh or Matisse or some other old classic 
They brought this Seuss fellow fresh from the West Coast 
to personally bring what he does the most 
To a place which has showcased Peruvian gold 
King Tut and old glass twas a stroke the most bold 
Theyve brought cats with tall hats creatures so long and 
slinky 
And how did he draw them with eyes that go winky 
They invited as well just to welcome him there 
a few fellow artists Oh heavens Beware 
Reporters Cartoonists Writers Art Critics 
Will they be converted Perhaps catalytic 
All joined in Big Easy at Carnival time 
to welcome the master of nonsense and rhyme 
Dr Seuss is the fellow we know him as Ted 
Geisels the last name Stick that in your head 
It seemed such a good scheme when the directors thought it 
that no one not even the ombudsmen fought it 
They wanted something classy to put on a show 
And so they went shopping in San Diego 
What they got were some prints some old manuscripts too 
to put up on the walls in red yellow and blue 
The old master walked in looking fit and welltanned 
and saw that the media there was wellmanned 
So he pitched out some quotes which they all gobbled up 
from the floor where they fell like fatbellied pups 
Asked what children might gain if they see Dr Seuss 
the sage quickly replied Well what will they lose 
Then he chuckled and said trying hard not to pun 
Why my only hope is theyll have them some fun 
Kids sometimes come to museums escorting mommies and daddies 
and wait holding thick fingers wishing for peppermint patties 
But heres an exhibit that all can admire 
There are creepies and crawlies and creative fire 
Dont worry bout this dont worry bout that 
said Seuss this is stuff just to be looked at 
The doors will be open until April 10 
So get yourself down here and walk yourself in 
And if youre afraid of an encounter with culture 
why youre in New Orleans just mask as a vulture 
Oh yes all the journalists cynical tired 
After seeing the Doctor they all left inspired
