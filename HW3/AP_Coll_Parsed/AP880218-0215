A biotechnology company said Wednesday it has 
developed a 95 percent accurate method of determining the sex of 
calves in the embryo 
This embryosexing technique makes it possible to control the 
composition of the herd said Joseph M Massey president of

The technique involves removing a few cells from the cow embryo

widespread use of artificial insemination one bull can sire 
thousands of calves
