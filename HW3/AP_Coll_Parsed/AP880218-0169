The nations chief prosecutor said Thursday 
he will seek the death penalty for the son of the late President 
Gamal Abdel Nasser and 10 other people charged in a series of 
shooting attacks on US and Israeli diplomats 
Prosecutor General Mohammed elGuindi announced the indictment 
of 20 people in the shootings 
Nassers eldest son Khaled Abdel Nasser and 10 other 
defendants will be tried for their lives by a high state security 
court They are charged with murder attempted murder and 
attempting to undermine Egypts internal security and relationships 
with the United States and Israel 
The other nine among them Nassers nephew Gamal Shawky Abdel 
Nasser face prison sentences up to life The indictment accuses 
them of complicity and covering up knowledge of criminal activity 
Khaled 38 is in Yugoslavia and Nassers nephew a physician 
is in Britain Egypt has no extradition treaty with either country 
and ElGuindi said Egypt will seek help from the international 
police agency Interpol to catch them 
The charges grew out of four attacks in four consecutive years 
on US and Israeli diplomats by gunmen in speeding cars Two 
Israeli diplomats were killed and six others were wounded in 
shootings between 1984 and 1986 Two US diplomats were wounded in 
the last of the attacks in May 1987 
All the attacks were followed by typewritten statements or 
telephone calls to foreign news service offices in Cairo claiming 
responsibility from a group calling itself Egypts Revolution The 
statements opposed Egypts 1979 peace treaty with Israel attacked 
the United States reflected proLibyan leanings and professed a 
panArab Nasserite ideology 
It was one of the key defendants who reportedly broke the case 
by contacting the US Embassy with an offer to sell information 
about the group Embassy officials interrogated him extensively 
then handed him to Egyptian authorities according to Egyptian 
press accounts 
The indictment listed Nassers son Khaled a professor at Cairo 
Universitys Engineering School as the second defendant after 
Mahmoud Nour elDin elSayed Ali Suliman 47 a businessman and 
former administrator at the Egyptian Embassy in London 
It said the two and Sulimans younger brother Ahmed founded 
Egypts Revolution with the aim of committing murder and 
hostile acts against the United States and Israel 
It said Mahmoud Suliman participated in all four attacks and his 
brother Ahmed in some of them 
In addition to helping form an illegal secret group Khaled 
Nasser was accused of financing it and supplying other material 
aid including firearms three hand grenades bulletproof vests 
and disguise paraphernalia He was not charged with participating 
in the shootings 
Under the name Egypts Revolution these men assassinated and 
attempted to assassinate diplomats with the aim of destabilizing 
the security situation in Egypt and spoiling relations between 
Egypt and those countries elGuindi said in summing up the 
indictment to reporters 
There was no intention to overthrow the government 
The defendants included two former military officers and a 
former corporal The financing came from abroad but the 
investigation has not showed from where elGuindi said 
The tone of statements from Egypts Revolution and the alleged 
involvement of Nassers son gave rise to speculation in Cairo that 
the money came from Libya whose leader Col Moammar Gadhafi is a 
selfproclaimed disciple of the late Egyptian president 
The amounts of money the annex said went to finance the group 
including monthly salaries to the defendants totaled hundreds of 
thousands of dollars 
ElGuindi refused comment on the reported involvement of the 
US Embassy in breaking the case 
One such report came from a leading Egyptian newspaper 
columnist Ahmed Bahaa elDin He told foreign correspondents last 
November that Ahmed Suliman approached US diplomats offering to 
sell information and that the Americans investigation led to the 
Egyptians solution of the case
