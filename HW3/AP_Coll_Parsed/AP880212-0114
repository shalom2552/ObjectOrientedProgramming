Annie Sims the preachers wife delivered the 
prophecy at a noon prayer meeting late in December 
The Lord said he was going to send a tornado and many shall 
die she recalls saying God spoke through her during the prayer 
service He was going to send his fury and vengeance on the 
people 
So 17 faithful members of the Repairer of the Breach Church of 
God in Christ gathered at their small westside church a converted 
twostory frame house on Jan 3 to await the wrath of God 
The congregation has been waiting faithfully peacefully ever 
since 
Any day now any moment members believe God will send a 
tornado spinning down from the heavens to smite the wicked and 
spare the righteous And spare their church 
Their number includes a school teacher a recent college 
graduate a college freshman and a restaurant worker with a 
management degree 
They have sacrificed jobs and education as well as the respect 
of family and friends who question their sanity 
The congregation has been challenged by the power of the state 
too 
Five members have been removed under court order though two of 
them have returned since undergoing forced psychiatric 
examinations Two children were taken from their mother and 
returned to school and a 51yearold man was ordered to undergo 
kidney dialysis treatment 
But unlike a Mormon polygamist clan in Utah whose recent 
resistance of police ended in a shootout that killed one officer 
these religious fundamentalists have quietly accepted the 
intrusions 
Were not against the court says ML Sims the church 
elder and preacher the husband of Annie If God allows it to 
happen then thats it 
Sims 36 says hes also lost the support of national church 
headquarters in Memphis Tenn which ordered him to take down a 
sign proclaiming affiliation Until the Lord says to move it 
its going to be up he says 
A woman who answered a call at the Memphis headquarters said no 
one was available to discuss the matter 
Despite the challenges from outsiders Sims and the church 
members welcome visitors and talk freely All profess an 
unshakeable belief in the tornado None say they want to leave 
The 39yearold Mrs Sims first prophesied the tornado would 
strike Jan 3 then Jan 24 Both dates passed uneventfully The 
Simses now say God delayed the tornado to gain time to spread the 
warning No new date has been set 
Itll be pretty soon says Sims Its nationally known 
now 
No ones faith is shaken by the delay or by meteorological 
precedent 
Tornadoes can occur anytime but most of the tornadoes in this 
area occur from March through June and then again late in the 
fall said National Weather Service forecaster Larry Mowery who 
says he cant recall a midwinter tornado ever striking the area 
Religion professor Patrick Olivelle chairman of the department 
at Indiana University says apocalyptic visions are common 
religious themes 
Of course there are always reasons why the end never comes 
he said I always tell my students that religion is not logic 
and you cannot put logical questions to that 
One of those waiting in the church David Freeman a 24yearold 
graduate of Grinnell College with a major in Spanish said 
Theres no doubt in my mind or in anyones mind that its going 
to come 
Freeman stopped showing up for his bank tellers job after Jan 
3 then called the bank to explain They didnt really understand 
it he said But after the tornado comes theyll understand 
and theyll congratulate us for standing up for the Lord 
The family of Ruschell Harris a Gary school teacher and her 
16yearold daughter Jeanetta won the court order compelling the 
two to undergo psychiatric evaluation 
Really at the time they felt I was so deeply under the 
influence of pastor that we couldnt do our own thinking she 
said If I believe something and its different from what you 
believe does that make me insane and you not 
Mrs Harris said she and her daughter returned voluntarily to 
the church after a psychiatrist found them competent 
Im 47 years old Ive been teaching for 20 years Ive taken 
my daughter out of school said Mrs Harris indignantly Do you 
think I would be here if I didnt believe it 
Jeanetta says it doesnt matter shes missing out on school 
It doesnt bother me because after the tornado the school may 
not be there 
A court gave custody of Patricia Sanders two sons Allen 
Simmons 13 and Charles Russell 12 to a brother who will return 
them to school Child welfare authorities took the children from 
the church 
I dont fight that Theyre just doing their job says Mrs 
Sanders They dont understand because this is spiritual 
The days are occupied with informal services talking and just 
waiting 
Praise God because this world is coming to an end and we 
want to be right chanted Elder Sims during one service People 
say were strange they say were crazy that were crackpots he 
intones mopping sweat from his face with a towel thrown around his 
beefy shoulders But were just doing what God says to do 
Better be so ready you may not know the day sings the 
congregation now a choir whose voice reverberates off bright 
bluepainted plaster walls 
There is no television or radio in the church and no 
newspapers Adult members take turns preparing meals in the fully 
equipped kitchen and the teenagers clean up The Simses live 
upstairs At night the others fold up the metal chairs and spread 
out bedding 
The cramped quarters are part of the sacrifice Weve all 
sacrificed here says 18yearold Falease Lemon who dropped out 
of Indiana Univeritys Gary campus God is going to pay us in 
return 
Jacqueline Sims the preachers 18yearold daughter says the 
waiting will be ended soon 
Well be out there after the tornado she says Then the 
world will be a better place to live with everybody doing Gods 
will
