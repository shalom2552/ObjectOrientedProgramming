Democrat Paul Simon shifting his focus to 
Michael Dukakis said Monday he was gaining on the leader and 
looked for a real surprise in New Hampshires leadoff 
presidential primary 
Dropping his attacks on Richard Gephardt with whom he was 
dueling for second place Simon sought to cut into Dukakis support 
and contended he could win outright 
Polls have shown the Massachusetts governor holding a twotoone 
margin over Gephardt and Simon 
I think increasingly the race is between Michael Dukakis and 
me the Illinois senator said What is clear now is we have 
moved into second place in contention with Michael Dukakis 
Simon stood on a snowy roadside at the New 
HampshireMassachusetts border and pleaded for voters to assert 
their independence and not back Dukakis merely because he is a 
neighboring governor 
There is a difference between me and Michael Dukakis a 
difference in experience a difference in commitment he said 
Simon came to New Hampshire a week ago after finishing a close 
second behind Gephardt in Iowa With his campaign in debt Simon 
went on the attack with television commercials that accused 
Gephardt of flipflopping on a range of positions 
He dropped those ads on Sunday and replaced them with 
commercials that portray Dukakis as a colorless bureaucrat lacking 
in vision 
Simon stuck to his theme of being an unrepentant liberal as he 
tried to chip away at Dukakiss lead on the final day of the 
campaign 
He cited education jobs longterm care for the elderly and 
infirm arms control and foreign policy Where is the Michael 
Dukakis program for longterm care he asked 
We need more than talk of a miracle Simon said in a 
deliberate reference to Dukakis claim to have engineered a 
Massachusetts miracle economic turnaround 
Simon is widely believed to need to finish second in order to 
continue a viable campaign He acknowledged his vulnerability even 
while predicting a good showing 
I think it is tightening he said I think there is a 
possibility of a real surprise come tomorrow 
Does that mean you could win he was asked 
That is correct Simon said 
But he added later We have to do well in New Hampshire and I 
am going to do well If we were to do poorly we would have to 
reevaluate
