flagship firm Bell Group Ltd said revaluing of investments 
caused the losses which also were spread across Holmes a Courts

A Bell Group spokesman said the losses reflected a clearing of 
the decks and the adoption of onetime writedowns

shares dropped sharply during the stock collapse 
All of Holmes a Courts investments in publicly traded

investments and said they have sold more investments since Dec 31
