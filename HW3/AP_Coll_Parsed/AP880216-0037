Iraq today claimed its warplanes hit a 
supertanker in the Persian Gulf after raiding Iranian troops along 
the war front 
The official Iraqi News Agency monitored in Nicosia said Iraqi 
warplanes attacked a very large maritime target a common 
reference to a supertanker off the Iran coast overnight It did 
not give the exact time of the raid 
The agency quoted an unidentified military spokesman as saying 
The Iraqi air force will continue to destroy naval targets that 
ferry Iranian crude because oil revenues are being used to finance 
the aggression against Iraq 
The news agency quoted a military communique as saying that 
Iraqi jets flew 60 combat missions earlier Monday along the war 
front inflicting substantial losses in men weaponry and 
equipment then returned safely to base 
It said Iraqi helicopter gunships rocketed and strafed Iranian 
military posts in 39 sorties destroying many of the enemys 
troop buildups and positions It gave no details 
Iran did not comment on the Iraqi claims However Iran said its 
outnumbered air force jets attacked a petrochemical complex and 
military installations in southern Iraq on Monday 
A communique issued in Tehran and carried by the official 
Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iranian warplanes heavily 
bombarded Iraqi positions and fortifications along the southern 
front east of the Iraqi city of Basra and in Faw Peninsula farther 
south 
Iranian warplanes also attacked a petrochemical complex in Basra 
in one of five raids carried out by early Monday afternoon IRNA 
said in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia All the attacking 
fighters returned safely to bases after inflicting heavy casualties 
and losses on the enemy it said 
Reports by Iran and Iraq which have been at war since 1980 
cannot be independently verified because they rarely allow access 
to combat zones 
Irans air force is outnumbered 8to1 by Iraqs fleet of 
Soviet and Frenchmade aircraft 
However in recent weeks Iran has used its USmade planes in 
several raids suggesting Tehran may have bought spare parts on the 
black market Iran has 6070 operational warplanes according to 
Western military analysts
