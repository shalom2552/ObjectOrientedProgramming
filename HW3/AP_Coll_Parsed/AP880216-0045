torched twice within eight days authorities said 
Two churches which opened their doors as temporary classrooms 
for North Omak Elementary School students and a church parsonage 
have been set afire during the last two weeks The latest blaze

damage and another fire set there Saturday caused 30000 in 
damage said Omak Assistant Police Chief Mike Cramer Another blaze 
hit the Methodist parsonage next door on Sunday Cramer said

flanked by evergreen trees

interest 
Investigators also were seeking to talk to four or five more

Presbyterian church said a roving custodiansecurity guard woke 
him early Monday to alert him to the fire 
Its got everybody on the edge he said Theyre nervous 
waiting to see whats going to happen next

was tough for them to move Now theyre going to have to again
