Campeau Corp said it will submit a sweetened 
cash bid for Federated Department Stores Inc in excess of 65 a 
share on Tuesday when the retail giants board is set to meet to 
review takeover offers 
Federated said in a statement Monday that while its board may 
act on the bids at the meeting there can be no assurance that 
any definitive transaction will take place A 65ashare bid 
would value the retail giant at about 575 billion 
Federated which confirmed it has been negotiating with numerous 
parties has twice spurned Campeau Federated rejected Campeaus 
initial 47pershare 42 billion takeover offer as inadequate 
and turned down an improved 61pershare 54 billion bid because 
it was not convinced Campeau had the necessary financing 
Federated said it was notified of Campeaus intentions in a 
letter over the weekend A Campeau spokeswoman confirmed that 
Campeau will make an offer to Federateds board to enter into a 
definitive agreement providing for a price per share in excess of 
65 in cash 
While Federated did acknowledge it had held talks with Campeau 
it did not identify other parties it has negotiated with Among 
those believed to be interested in Federated is the leveraged 
buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp Co 
Last week in a letter to Henry Kravis Campeau Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer Robert Campeau warned that any agreement 
between KKR and Federated would be met with a vigorous legal 
challenge 
Federated said the negotiations involve the possible 
restructuring of the Cincinnatibased retailer which operates 
about 650 stores in 36 states and had sales exceeding 11 billion 
in 1987 
The purpose of these negotiations is to be able to present to 
the companys board of directors several alternatives for the 
boards consideration Each of the parties has been urged to make 
its best proposal because the board may take definitive action at 
that time Federated said in its statement Monday 
The company also said the board will consider the risks 
inherent in any such transaction the financial capability of the 
purchaser and the extent to which any purchaser may have taken 
action to discourage others from submitting proposals to the 
company 
A Campeau spokeswoman retorted that possible action to 
discourage others was a veiled reference to Campeaus letter to 
KKR and if that is the case we believe our letter is totally 
justifiable 
Federated revealed in a Feb 5 Securities and Exchange 
Commission filing that it was considering alternatives including 
selling assets restructuring or an outright sale of the company 
Campeau a Torontobased development company bought Allied 
Stores Corp in December 1986 Campeau sold several Allied 
divisions but retained retailing chains including Ann Taylor 
Brooks Brothers and Jordan Marsh 
Federateds holdings include the New Yorkbased chains of 
Bloomingdales and Abraham and Straus Filenes of Boston Burdines 
of Miami Richs in Atlanta Bullocks and Bullocks Wilshire in Los 
Angeles I Magnin in San Francisco and Lazarus in Cincinnati 
Ohio politicians are worried that Campeau will buy Federated 
sell off major portions of the company and fire or lay off large 
numbers of its employees 
Sen Howard Metzenbaum DOhio and chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committees antitrust subcommittee said last week he is 
concerned that a Campeau purchase of Federated could reduce retail 
competition in New York City Boston and Miami where Allied and 
Federated both own stores 
Separate Campeau has obtained a restraining order against a 
recently enacted Ohio law the makes takeovers by foreign companies 
more cumbersome
