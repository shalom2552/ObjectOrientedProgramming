Bruce Babbitt campaigning hours before 
Tuesdays Democratic presidential primary pledged Monday to pass 
national legislation to curb acid rain and take the issue to an 
international summit 
The time for research has passed Babbitt said at a rally at 
the Statehouse The time for procrastination is over Its time 
for action now 
The former Arizona governor told reporters after the rally he 
anticipates doing better than expected in the states leadoff 
primary 
Asked what he would consider a strong showing Babbitt who has 
been consistently in the single digits in polls said I honestly 
dont know It depends in some measure on what the prognosticators 
and commentators have to say 
Im anticipating a strong showing and a surprise but I cant 
put a number on it he said 
Babbitt was the only candidate to show up at the rally sponsored 
in part by the League of Conservation Voters who last week gave 
Babbitt the highest marks among the candidates for his efforts to 
clean up the environment 
Babbitt said that when he thinks of acid rain he remembers the 
immortal words of a president called Ronald Reagan who once 
stood up in a public place and proclaimed that its trees that 
cause pollution 
Babbitt said Reagan as governor of California once was greeted 
by a sign on a pine tree on a college campus that said Chop me 
down before I kill again 
The silent tragedy of dying forests and lakes is not 
confined to New England he said 
Babbitt described his own fight as Arizona governor to demand 
that two coppersmelting plants that were causing acid rain obey 
environmental laws When they refused he went to the legislature 
and eventually shut them down he said 
But afterwards Babbitt said I looked over my shoulder and 60 
miles across the border in Mexico they were building a copper 
smelter which the day it opened would erase all the gains we had 
made in 10 years of fighting in the West 
When he sought help form the Reagan administration to stop the 
plant he claimed They said thats none of our business 
Environmental problems are our problems but theyre also the 
planets problems Babbitt said He pledged that as president he 
will put environmental issues such as acid rain on the agenda of an 
international summit
