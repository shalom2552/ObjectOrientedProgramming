Latedeciding Republican voters confounded the 
polls and boosted George Bush to his convincing victory over Sen 
Bob Dole in the New Hampshire presidential primary analysts say 
Voters who made their choice in the races final days went 
strongly for Bush in part because of his superior campaign 
organization his ties to the Reagan administration and his 
experience in office exit polls indicated Tuesday 
The result was a 9point victory for the vice president after 
some polls had shown him leading Dole just barely by 4 points in a 
CBS NewsNew York Times poll and 2 points in an ABC NewsWashington 
Post survey 
The voters of New Hampshire have a welldeserved reputation of 
upsetting poll results and tonight was a good example of that 
said NBC News pollster Laurily Epstein People change their 
minds and you cant poll for that 
An NBC NewsWall Street Journal exit poll found that 14 percent 
of the GOP voters in New Hampshire made up their minds on primary 
day with 36 percent going for Bush and 29 percent for Dole 
Another 11 percent decided during the weekend breaking 44 percent 
for Bush to 31 percent for Dole 
It was the undecideds The undecideds went for Bush said 
John Berrigan a poll analyst for ABC News A key reason Bushs 
identification with President Reagan who is very popular among New 
Hampshire Republicans 
The Reagan coattails were there said Jerry Strom an NBC 
News poll consultant People who like Reagan were going strongly 
for Bush 
NBCs exit poll supported that contention Threequarters of 
Republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set 
by Reagan 88 percent of Bushs supporters held that view compared 
with 66 percent of Doles 
There were fewer Reagan backers in Iowa and more of them went 
for Dole than for Bush albeit narrowly in the precinct caucuses 
Feb 8 Dole won big there while Bush suffered a thirdplace 
embarrassment 
Berrigan said New Hampshires economic vitality could explain 
Reagans popularity in that state and its benefit for Bush You 
may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here a belief 
that there may be a threat if I dont go with someone whos 
following the same line he said 
Perhaps for similar reasons a third of Republicans said 
experience was the chief factor in their vote and 54 percent of 
them voted for Bush to 37 percent for Dole the CBSTimes poll 
said Dole won among Republicans looking chiefly for a strong 
leader with 48 percent to 21 percent for Bush but that group made 
up just 19 percent of the GOP total 
Another key for Bush was his extensive campaign organization in 
New Hampshire The CBSTimes poll found that 47 percent of Bushs 
backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his 
organization while just 26 percent of Doles supporters reported 
contact by the Dole campaign 
I think the thing that won it for Bush was his organization 
said Warren Mitofsky polling chief at CBS News 
While the polls did not anticipate the extent of Bushs victory 
Mitofsky said they did identify trends in the race Bush way ahead 
before the Iowa caucuses dropping sharply after losing to Dole and 
Pat Robertson in Iowa then halting his slide and rebounding during 
the weekend 
Speaking on CBS Bush credited his victory to a surge of support 
in the last 48 hours I learned from that fight back Fight 
on he said Its taught me a good lesson Do not be 
discouraged by the polling numbers 
The exit poll results were less remarkable on the Democratic 
side where Michael Dukakis won handily as expected ABC had him 
winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in 
organization 
The poll results also indicated Dukakis backyard advantage ABC 
said 55 percent of Democrats rated Dukakis above average as 
governor of neighboring Massachusetts and 59 percent of them voted 
for him Moreover the CBSTimes poll found that 20 percent of New 
Hampshires Democratic voters moved there from Massachusetts and 
four in 10 of them went for Dukakis 
Rep Richard Gephardts secondplace finish appeared to be aided 
by his firstplace showing in Iowa Of the voters who made up their 
minds after Iowa 27 percent went to Gephardt 26 percent to 
Dukakis and 20 percent to Sen Paul Simon who finished second in 
Iowa and third in New Hampshire
