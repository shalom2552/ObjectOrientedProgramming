Georgia Tech shut down its controversyplagued 
nuclear reactor Monday and the schools president said it would 
remain idle at least until safety concerns are resolved and might 
never be restarted 
Tech President John P Crecine said the school was voluntarily 
suspending all reactor operations not already halted by the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission pending full NRC approval of the schools 
reactor operations 
The NRC already has suspended irradiation experiments at the 
24yearold reactor on Techs intown Atlanta campus following a 
mishap resulting in some apparent contamination in the reactor 
building last summer 
This move does not in any way reflect concern on my part with 
the safety of the reactor operations now or in the immediate 
past Crecine said at a news conference It does reflect my 
belief that normal safe and efficient operations of this research 
facility are becoming increasingly difficult with the publicity 
 
Crecine who characterized the reactors troubles as basically 
internal staff problems said the reactor will not resume 
operations until its staff is upgraded and the NRC lifts the 
irradiation experiment ban and favorably reviews safety procedures 
He said a permanent shutdown of the troubled reactor operation 
is certainly a possibility 
Continuing operation of the reactor is dependent on the 
operating and political costs incurred by Georgia Tech Crecine 
said 
Crecine also defended last Thursdays firing of two reactor 
staff physicists who had complained about safety problems Tech had 
already decided to upgrade the professional quality of the 
reactor staff he said and the two technicians were dismissed as 
part of that effort 
The two workers were among three members of the health physics 
staff directly responsible for reactor safety Crecine said The 
third a manager has been transferred 
The irradiation experiments which the NRC ordered halted 
constituted about 20 percent of the work done at the reactor Much 
of the reactors other operations are conducted for nonGeorgia 
Tech interests such as other universities and for medical 
researchers Crecine said 
Shutdown of the reactor will have an impact at Tech where 
about 100 undergraduate students participate in nuclear engineering 
classes utilizing the facility he said 
The NRC last week blasted Tech saying safety conditions at the 
reactor had not improved significantly since last May when the 
school said it would correct numerous problems at the facility 
Lack of adequate management at the reactor apparently 
jeopardized the safety of workers and the public the NRC said in a 
report
