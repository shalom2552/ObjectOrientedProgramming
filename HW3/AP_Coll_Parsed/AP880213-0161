Black students occupying a building at the 
University of Massachusetts to protest alleged racial harassment 
stockpiled food and sleeping bags Saturday and said they would stay 
until their demands are met 
Protesters refused to meet with Chancellor Joseph D Duffey when 
he went to New Africa House on Friday afternoon On Saturday 
morning Duffey again went to the house but was stopped on the 
landing by two students who said no meeting would be held until he 
met all their demands 
Duffey said the school would take no reprisals against the 
protesters Theyre not disrupting anything yet he said 
But he declined to outline what action might be taken if the 
building is still occupied when school reopens Tuesday after the 
Washingtons Birthday holiday 
We consider the Third World control of the New Africa House to 
be a permanent one said Rudy Krigger a protester He said 
Saturday afternoon there were about 125 minority protesters still 
in the building 
The students took over the building Friday after talks with 
Duffey on a list of demands which include prosecution of five 
white students accused of attacking two blacks after a dormitory 
party last weekend 
Gov Michael S Dukakis taking time from his Democratic 
presidential campaign swing through New Hampshire called the 
racial incident intolerable behavior and said he discussed the 
situation with Duffey and Franklyn Jenifer chancellor of the 
statewide higher education system 
They know I want this kind of racial problem dealt with 
firmly and promptly not only at Amherst but throughout the 
system Dukakis said Theyve assured me thats exactly what is 
happening 
The students also asked Duffey to suspend a campus police 
officer who they say arranged a police lineup of black men after 
white and minority students complained of harassment and called 
for New Africa House be returned to use as a cultural center for 
the black community 
But Arthur Hilson head of the campus police denied Saturday 
that any such lineup occurred adding that it was a rumor that was 
blown out of proportion 
The New Africa House building now contains the AfroAmerican 
Studies department in addition to other academic offices and 
classrooms About 7 percent of the schools 18000 undergraduates 
are black 
This place being turned into an academic building is robbing 
them of their cultural base on campus said Dwayne Warren a 
senior acting as liaison between protesters and administrators 
My first responsibility is education and this building is 
committed to education in a range of ways said Duffey Im not 
about to put black AfroAmerican professors out of this building 
The protesters who have so far declined to talk publicly are 
not affiliated with any group and numbered 150 at the height of the 
takeover Friday night 
The protesters were allowed free access to and from the building 
and no banners or other indications of the takeover were visible to 
spectators 
Within hours of receiving the demands Friday Duffey issued a 
statement condemning racism and asked campus police to no longer 
use lineups 
Two of the five white students accused in the beating were 
ordered to move out of campus residence halls Friday after a 
disciplinary hearing A Feb 24 court hearing is scheduled to 
determine whether there is sufficient evidence to charge the five 
students with criminal violations 
The head of campus police met Saturday with students and black 
community leaders to line up creature comforts in case of 
arrests 
I want to be prepared to do something in a sensitive caring 
and humane way said Hilson a black Baptist minister who came to 
the police department from the career planning office amid 
criticism of police handling of a 1986 racial clash 
I think there is a way to do it other than the ways Ive seen 
in the past said Hilson Were talking about students making a 
statement not criminals These are students who have a belief in 
what theyre doing 
Food money and sleeping bags had been donated to the students 
Mark CodlingDave a sophomore and spokesman for the protesters 
said earlier the group had received an inadequate response to 
its demands 
The protesters cited racial tensions that have surfaced at the 
school since 10 students were injured in a racial clash on Oct 27 
1986 following the Boston Red Sox loss to the New York Mets in the 
final game of the World Series 
Blacks at the university which has a total of 25000 students 
said an undercurrent of racism has not abated since that clash
