State lottery games have had few scandals but inevitably 
someone is tempted to try to shorten the odds 
One of the more recent scandals was in New York where four 
workers in the lottery divisions mailroom were caught intercepting 
stubs in a secondchance and putting their own names on them 
The four were fired 
In 1975 all 318 lottery workers in New York were laid off and 
the games were suspended after it was discovered that tickets with 
duplicate numbers had been printed for one drawing The games 
resumed the next year 
The chairman of New Jerseys lottery commission was indicted in 
1983 for submitting false letters to a state ethics committee The 
panel was investigating whether the chairman Reese Palley had a 
business relationship with lottery contractors or potential 
contractors 
Palley pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge 
In Ohio a former official was convicted of mail fraud in 1980 
along with an accomplice for rigging a game He was found out when 
lottery employees noticed that the officials fiancee had won 
21000 
Pennsylvania had a loaded pingpong ball scandal in 1980 Eight 
people were convicted of rigging a Daily Number drawing and winning 
35 million Greed was their undoing investigators said heavy 
betting by the conspirators gave the game away 
Last month Delawares High Card game suffered an 
embarrassing booboo when it was discovered that numbers could be 
read on a scratchcard game without having to scratch The cards 
were withdrawn
