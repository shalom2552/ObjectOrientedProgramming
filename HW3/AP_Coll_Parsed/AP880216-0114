State and local governments businesses and 
private groups are being asked to help finance and develop more 
recreational services in federally owned national forests the 
Agriculture Department announced Tuesday 
F Dale Robertson chief of the departments Forest Service 
said the move is in response to increasing demands for more 
recreational areas and service and to help relieve pressures on 
federal spending 
The squeezed budget is a factor Robertson told a news 
conference We just cant simply do the job financing it all out 
of the federal budget 
Robertson said the Challenge CostShare Program was 
authorized by Congress on a pilot basis at a level of 500000 for 
the fiscal year that began last Oct 1 Of that 100000 was 
earmarked for the Tonto National Forest near Phoenix Ariz with 
the remainder available to other regions to supplement money put up 
by local people companies state agencies municipalities or other 
groups 
Some 31 recreation projects have been approved and will be 
underway this spring and summer he said Restoration and 
improvement of existing facilities areas and trails are typical 
goals 
The 500000 of Forest Service seed money was met with 908000 
from various partners involved in the 31 pilot projects 
One of the objectives of the program will be to provide more 
facilities on national forest land located near cities 
We really need to look at these urban Americans and how they 
can use the national forests to meet their recreational needs 
Robertson said 
What will the project mean to Americans who visit national 
forests 
It will mean more camp sites more picnic areas more trails 
more opportunities for people to visit the national forests he 
said 
Private investors will be encouraged to develop new campgrounds 
marinas ski areas No increase in user fees is being proposed at 
this time but that is comething that eventually will have to be 
faced he said 
Asked if the plan means opening the door for major private 
development on national forest land Robertson replied 
Yes we are opening that door but we also need to work with 
those private sector proposals to see if they fit into the overall 
scheme for recreation development 
Robertson said the recreation project is patterned after a 
similar Challenge Grant program that Congress initiated in 1986 to 
improve fish and wildlife on national forest lands 
The Forest Service administers 191 million acres or about 8 
percent of the US total land area Although most is in the West 
the land is scattered among 156 national forests in 42 states and 
Puerto Rico Robertson said that if all of it could be put into one 
place it would be an area 10 percent larger than Texas 
Robertson said the proposed budget that President Reagan is 
scheduled to send Congress on Thursday for the 1989 fiscal year 
that will begin on Oct 1 will include 3 million for the 
recreation costshare program up from the 500000 in pilot funds 
this year The one for fish and wildlife will be requested at 5 
million compared with 15 million in fiscal 1988
