A federal jury began deliberating racketeering 
charges Wednesday against six men and two women accused of 
belonging to the Westies a gang of thugs that allegedly terrorized 
Manhattans Hells Kitchen neighborhood for 20 years 
The case which has featured graphic accounts of killings and 
dismemberments went to the jury after nearly four months of 
testimony and more than a week of closing arguments 
The panel worked for about 4 hours before breaking off 
deliberations for the night 
A 14count racketeering indictment charged the eight defendants 
were members of a criminal enterprise that seized control of the 
West Side neighborhood and held sway there for nearly two decades 
through a series of killings and other violent crimes 
Prosecutors also contended the Westies trafficked in drugs 
counterfeit money and stolen goods engaged in loansharking and 
extortion and killed people who got in their way 
Prosecutors Mary Lee Warren and David Brodsky said the Westies 
had committed a series of killings that included dismembering the 
victims bodies in order to enhance their reputation and eliminate 
competitors 
The indictment listed the names of 10 alleged coconspirators 
who had been killed before the charges were brought in March 
The defense argued most of the evidence is based on the 
uncorroborated testimony of informers who were themselves killers 
thieves and drug dealers 
The main prosecution witness Francis Mickey Featherstone 
said he had been the righthand man of reputed Westies boss 
James Coonan 
Featherstone who has admitted committing three homicides 
himself testified he helped Coonan conduct a loansharking business 
and was present at a 1978 meeting when the Westies agreed to work 
with the Gambino organized crime family 
He also linked Coonan to the killing and dismemberment of a 
recalcitrant loanshark customer 
On crossexamination by Coonans attorney Gerald Shargel 
Featherstone acknowleged being in and out of mental hospitals in 
the 1970s lying under oath in the past and suffering psychotic 
episodes 
Shargel and other defense lawyers also denied even the existence 
of an organization called the Westies 
Even government witnesses conceded the name Westies was created 
by the police and news media to describe a group of mainly 
IrishAmerican hoodlums on Manhattans West Side 
In addition to Coonan and his wife Edna 44 both of Hazlet 
NJ the defendants are James Jimmy Mack McElroy 42 William 
Indian Bokun 30 John Halo 36 Richard Muggsy Ritter 50 
Thomas Collins 53 and his wife Florence 52 all of Manhattan 
All face a maximum penalty of 20 years each if convicted of 
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy the most serious charges
