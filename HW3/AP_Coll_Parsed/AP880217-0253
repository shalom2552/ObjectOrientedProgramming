Burger King Corp hopes to reignite sales growth 
with an advertising campaign that invokes the memory of the 
flamebroilingversusfrying debate that engulfed the fastfood 
industry in the early 1980s 
The campaign employs the theme We do it like youd do it and 
pitches Burger Kings flamebroiling process as the one which 
burgerlovers prefer 
The campaign contains some reminders of the hardhitting ads of 
1982 in which Burger King asserted that tests showed people 
preferred its flamebroiled hamburgers to those from the industry 
leader McDonalds Corp 
McDonalds objected saying its burgers are grilled and not 
fried The exchange became known as the Burger Wars 
McDonalds name is only mentioned once in the new Burger King 
ads which were previewed for the media Tuesday in a New York hotel 
room decorated to look like a backyard complete with sod a 
barbecue pit lawnmower and picnic tables 
In one new ad a kindergartener discovers that her Burger King 
hamburger has lines from broiling She likes the taste and asks 
a friend why she never gets similar lines on burgers from 
McDonalds Her pal shrugs 
In another ad a foreign exchange student savors a broiled 
Burger King hamburger and complains to some friends that 
hamburgers are usually fried in his country When told that some 
burger places fry them here too the student registers his 
disbelief with a long Noooooo 
The ads begin appearing Feb 29 and Burger King reportedly 
plans to spend about 200 million putting them on the air and in 
print over the next year 
The approach created by the agency NW Ayer Inc replaces the 
Best Food for Fast Times theme that had been created by J 
Walter Thompson Ayer was selected for the Burger King account last 
fall 
Burger King officials speaking on condition they not be 
identified by name said consumers liked the Best Food and 
This is a Burger King Town campaigns created by Thompson but 
failed to remember the characteristic that separates Burger King 
from other hamburger chains flamebroiling 
Charles S Olcott president of the Miamibased Burger King USA 
said the companys average sales per store had stalled Burger 
Kings average sales per store cracked 1 million for the first 
time in 1985 but rose to only 102 million in the year ended May 
31 1987 
McDonalds had average sales per store of 137 million in 1986 
and has about 7400 stores nationwide compared with 4700 for 
Burger King 
They are the leaders in the fastfood market which the trade 
magazine Advertising Age estimates at 60 billion Hamburgers 
account for roughly half of the figure 
Another hamburger chain Wendys International Inc based in 
Dublin Ohio recently began airing new versions of an old campaign 
Wendys and Hardees Food Systems Inc based in Rocky Mount 
NC are fighting for third place in hamburgers analysts say 
The agency Backer Spielvogel Bates has created some new 
versions of a 2yearold campaign for Wendys known as 
Hamburger AHamburger B 
The campaign spoofs consumer tastetests as an interviewer asks 
someone in each ad to choose between a freshlooking Wendys 
Hamburger A and an unappetizing Hamburger B 
A truck driver picks B in one ad and beams that he can have one 
in Shakeytown and still be tasting it in Salt Lake In another 
a woman trying to lose weight said shed pick B because she 
wouldnt be tempted to eat it 
Wendys used humor to boost sales in 1984 when its advertising 
asked Wheres the Beef Wendys average sales per store peaked 
at about 861000 in 1984 but slipped to 767000 in 1986 
according to spokesman Paul Raab 
With the new ads and the installation of SuperBars that offer 
allyoucaneat Mexican or Italian food or salads in about a third 
of its 3600 domestic restaurants Wendys sales are picking up 
said another spokesman Denny Lynch 
He added the company expects a gradual improvement through the 
year
