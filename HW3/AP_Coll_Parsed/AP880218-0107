Maintaining peace in a troubled world is the most important 
responsibility of government Fortunately during the past seven 
years our defense capabilities have been restored toward levels 
more consistent with meeting our responsibility to provide an 
environment safe and secure from aggression Specifically combat 
readiness has been improved and our forces have been modernized 
The proposals for national security contained in this budget 
represent an essential minimum program for keeping America safe and 
honoring our commitments to our friends and allies Anything less 
would jeopardize not only our security and that of our friends 
and allies but also would dim the prospects for further 
negotiated agreements with our adversaries 
As called for in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement my budget 
requests defense funding of 2995 billion in budget authority and 
294 billion in outlays for 1989 It also provides for about 2 
percent real growth in these programs in future years Also as 
called for in the agreement my budget requests 181 billion in 
budget authority for discretionary spending for international 
affairs This includes 83 billion in security assistance to 
allied and friendly countries where the United States has special 
security concerns

Incentives It is essential to continue to change the incentive 
structure for many domestic federal programs to promote greater 
efficiency and costeffectiveness This budget proposes to create 
such needed incentives 
Many federal programs offer payments without sufficient regard 
for how well taxpayers money is being spent For example farm 
price support programs under the Food Security Act of 1985 are 
much too costly I plan to continue pushing for the elimination of 
artificially high price supports thereby reducing the need for 
export subsidies In particular I plan to propose amendments to 
the act to modify the counterproductive sugar price support program 
that currently poses significant problems in the areas of trade 
policy foreign policy and agricultural policy The importance of 
agricultural trade to the economic health of the farm sector and 
the nation as a whole mandates increased reliance on free markets 
not government largess 
The budget proposes certain reforms in the Medicare program in 
order to achieve the savings agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget 
Agreement First as justified by the results of several 
independent studies I propose to reduce the addon payment for 
teaching hospitals under the prospective payment system PPS for 
indirect medical education from 770 percent to 405 percent the 
best estimate of the added costs incurred historically by teaching 
hospitals Second I propose to limit Medicare overhead payments 
for graduate medical education and make consistent varying 
secondary payor enforcement mechanisms To reduce escalating 
supplementary medical insurance costs and help slow future 
increases in beneficiary premiums I propose to limit payments for 
certain overpriced physician procedures limit payments for durable 
medical equipment and supplies and eliminate a loophole in the 
payment process for kidney dialysis In total these reforms would 
reduce spending for Medicare by 12 billion from the level that 
would occur if current law were continued Spending for the 
Medicare program would still increase by 7 percent from 1988 to 
1989
