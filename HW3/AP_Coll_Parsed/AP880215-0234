Rick Springfield considers himself a searcher a 
learner And three years ago he discovered that he needed some 
time away from the music business 
After a series of hit albums a featured role in the hit TV 
soap General Hospital and a feature movie Hard to Hold 
Springfield had had enough 
I had nothing to say he recalled 
There was no one moment It was a process I was walking 
around my house this beautiful ranch in Malibu I was thinking 
about how unhappy I was 
On his new LP Rock of Life Springfield sings about the 
pressures of fame why he had to quit why he is back 
I was caught with my guard down when the world came 
knocking he sings on the title track the albums first single 
Theres pain and confusion and Im trying to understand 
On World Start Turning he sings Just another soul lost 
in America I was so frustrated 
One of the problems with fame he said was that being the idol 
of millions of female fans created tension with his 
thengirlfriend Barbara Jean who is now his wife We had a lot 
of problems I denied her for a while People would ask me if I had 
a girlfriend and Id say no She had trouble handling me 
Springfields first hit single was Speak to the Sky a Top 
15 hit in 1972 and No 1 in his native Australia He also released 
the albums Comic Book Heroes and Wait for Night 
When his music career cooled he took up acting making 
appearances on The Six Million Dollar Man The Rockford 
Files and The Incredible Hulk 
But it was his role as Dr Noah Drake in General Hospital 
that set Springfields career soaring 
In the early 1980s he released the platinumselling albums 
Working Class Dog and Success Hasnt Spoiled Me Yet 
Jessies Girl a single from Working Class Dog reached No 
1 on the charts and earned him a Grammy Award in 1981 Success 
Hasnt Spoiled Me Yet yielded another major hit single Dont 
Talk to Strangers which earned a Grammy nomination for best male 
pop vocalist 
But after the hit LP Living in Oz and 1985s TAO 
Springfield took time off to be with his wife and their newlyborn 
son Liam Becoming a parent was a major turning point in his life 
I accepted the responsibility he said I realized I had 
to be strong enough for both of us 
Raising a child also made him think about his father who had 
died a few years before Liam was born 
On Tear It All Down the rocker that leads off Side 2 of 
Rock of Life he sings I look at my innocent boy as he 
sleeps I wish there was some way I could talk to my father 
again 
I felt I needed to talk to him Springfield said Seeing 
myself with Liam I saw a lot of him in me 
Despite the hiatus Springfield was able to record the new album 
in only nine weeks I was very definite about I wanted I do 
extensive demos he said 
He also credits producer Keith Olsen who worked on Jessies 
Girl and another hit single Ive Done Everything for You 
with giving him the sound he wanted 
When I finished the demos I realized there would be a lot of 
vocals Springfield said Keith is real real good with vocals 
Keith has the ability to create a warm sound 
While most of the album is about the downside of fame the two 
final songs are upbeat Hold On to Your Dream and If You 
Think Youre Groovy 
Hold On to Your Dream is about losing hope then regaining 
it Dont tell me its over I still smell the fire 
Springfield sings 
Groovy is the albums only remake Written in the late 60s 
by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane of the English rock group The 
Small Faces Groovy is a personal favorite of Springfields and 
a song that almost did not get put on the album 
I had to fight a couple of battles but I had good reasons for 
putting it on the record A It had a different slant B Its a 
part of my life an important part of my life he said 
With the album completed and a worldwide tour anticipated 
Springfield is hopeful about maintaining his popularity 
I think Ive taken my audience along with me he said I 
dont think Im going to lose fans because Im married I think the 
young crowd is in a position to appreciate whats being said 
Regardless of how successful his comeback is Springfield wants 
to continue to grow as a person 
Id like to have the time to grow as a writer and learn what I 
need to learn he said Discovering yourself is instrumental
