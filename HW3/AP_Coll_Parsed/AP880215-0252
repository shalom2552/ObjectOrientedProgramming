Congressional leaders have agreed to 
iron out differences between House and Senate versions of a trade 
bill and send it to the House floor for passage by April 1 Speaker 
Jim Wright said Monday 
Wright DTexas told reporters after meeting with the AFLCIOs 
executive council that he won an agreement last week with Senate 
Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia and all the leaders 
of the legislation to wrap up a HouseSenate conference on a 
compromise version by March 23 
No question in my mind well pass a trade bill with 
enough votes to override a veto should that be necessary he 
said 
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker said last month that 
President Reagan would veto either version as they stand now as 
being too protectionist Both were passed early last year but 
efforts to reach a HouseSenate compromise to be sent to the White 
House were abandoned after the October stock market crash 
Basically each would require countries with free access to US 
markets to provide that same type of open access to American goods 
in their markets If a country does not remove its tariffs or 
quotas on American goods the president would be required to impose 
the same measures on their exports to the United States 
Wright said he also met last week with Treasury Secretary James 
A Baker III and Reagans trade representative Clayton Yeutter 
expressing a willingness to compromise on the administrations 
biggest objections He said he also promised them a House vote on 
the USCanada free trade agreement by the end of the year 
I dont want to push them into a corner of threatening 
vetoes he said They would be smart if they didnt threaten 
vetoes if they hedged a little bit on that because we can modify 
some things 
Wright made it clear that some version of a measure requiring 
employers to provide their workers 60 days advance notice of plant 
closings will be in the final package But he indicated that a 
sacrifice will likely be made of a provision in the House bill 
written by Rep Richard Gephardt DMo 
Both provisions have shared the status as the AFLCIOs top 
legislative priority for more than two years Both also share the 
biggest focus of White House veto threats 
Gephardts measure a primary theme in his presidential 
campaign would mandate retaliatory import quotas or tariffs on 
some countries if they do not reduce their trade imbalances with 
the United States by 10 percent a year 
His use of TV spots warning Korea that if it didnt open up its 
markets to American goods it could face US tariffs he said would 
raise the price of a Koreanmade Hyundai car to 48000 in the 
United States was credited with reviving his campaign with a 
victory in last weeks Iowa caucuses 
Wright complained of a fixation on the Gephardt measure 
predicting that the conferees will agree on something in 
between it and a Senate modification that links the enforcement 
mechanism more to how much US exports to a particular country 
rise 
AFLCIO President Lane Kirkland said unions still prefer the 
Gephardt language which is aimed primarily at South Korea Japan 
Taiwan and West Germany 
Despite the large devaluation of the dollar against most foreign 
currencies last year that helped send US exports surging the 
trade imbalance with those four countries widened by more than an 
additional 8 billion last year to more than 100 billion 
We continue to insist that whatever comes out must be 
substantive forceful and effective and not simply an expression of 
pious good wishes Kirkland said
