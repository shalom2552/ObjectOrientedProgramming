A comet slamming into Earth may have triggered a 
yearlong storm of acid rain as poisonous as battery acid that 
killed off dinosaurs and other creatures a scientist says 
Animals deep in their burrows and creatures living in lakes with 
limestone bottoms might have been among the few survivors of the 
catastrophic collision 65 million years ago according to a theory 
outlined by Ronald G Prinn of Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology 
The new theory is a variation on a hotly debated hypothesis that 
an asteroid from space doomed the dinosaurs 
Prinn suggests that a large comet one that makes Halleys 
comet look like a little speck of sand struck the Earth with 
1 million times more force than the worlds entire nuclear arsenal 
This would be a very unusual event something that might 
happen once in a billion years Prinn said Sunday at a meeting of 
the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
The idea that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs was first 
proposed in 1980 by physicist Luis Alvarez and his son Walter a 
geologist They said that dust and soot thrown into the air would 
have blocked out the sunlight Temperatures would have plummeted 
and many animals including the dinosaurs would have frozen to 
death 
Prinn noted that while there was a large extinction not all 
animals fared equally badly The great land reptiles and many kinds 
of sea life were decimated but many mammals and plants survived 
reasonably well He said his acid rain theory may explain the 
peculiar selectivity of the extinctions 
Since limestone would neutralize the acid fish in limestone 
lakes might have lived Hibernating animals deep in burrows might 
also have waited out the worst of the acid rain storm and eggs 
laid in the ground could also have survived 
Plants would have been killed but their seeds remained to 
sprout after the acid storm cleared However planteating animals 
such as large dinosaurs would have starved to death or been 
asphyxiated 
Prinn theorized that all calciumcontaining ocean animals down 
to a depth of about 500 feet would have been annihilated Deeper 
sea creatures would have survived as would those with skeletons of 
silica 
Many scientists doubt that something from space caused the 
massive destruction of species They note that dinosaurs and other 
longgone creatures died out over many centuries not all at once 
so a single catastrophe cannot be the culprit 
David Raup of the University of Chicago argued that there have 
been many extinctions over the eons but only one has been shown to 
have occurred about the same time as an apparent heavenly 
collision He said this might simply have been a coincidence 
Others have suggested that gigantic volcanic eruptions were to 
blame for the mysterious extinctions 
Prinn theorizes that when the comet hit it blasted out a 
crater spewing water and rock into the air at supersonic speeds 
suddenly heating the atmosphere to enormous temperatures The heat 
made oxygen and nitrogen in the air combine to form nitric acid 
which rained on Earth for a year
