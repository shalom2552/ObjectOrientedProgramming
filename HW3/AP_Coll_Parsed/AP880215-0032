The FBIs investigation of a group opposed to 
Reagan administration policies in Central America focused in part 
on fliers distributed at rallies and public speeches even though 
the activities are protected by the First Amendment 
Newly released FBI documents show that agents reported back to 
bureau headquarters on political literature and meetings by the 
Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador 
The 2000 pages of bureau documents provide only a fragmentary 
look at the FBI probe since many of the pages are substantially 
blacked out or withheld entirely 
But even FBI headquarters was disturbed at one point by the 
direction the investigation was taking warning offices to stay 
away from reporting legitimate political statements and lobbying 
The FBI investigation of CISPES never resulted in any charges 
against the group or its members 
One bureau document shows the FBI cited political literature to 
cast suspicion on CISPES in connection with the stillunsolved 
November 1983 bombing of the US Capitol The document notes that 
it is interesting that a flier claiming responsibility for the 
Capitol bombing was passed out along with the CISPES literature 
at a Nov 12 1983 rally 
Another document indicates the FBI tried to find a connection 
between CISPES and a May 1983 bombing at the Army National War 
College in Washington The document says that an unidentified 
individual contacted a local radio station in Washington DC a 
few days after the bombing and advised that we are in solidarity 
with the people of El Salvador and Guatemala At the time of the 
bombing representatives of the Committee in Solidarity with the 
People of El Salvador CISPES were meeting in Washington DC 
CISPES contends that the investigation amounted to political 
harassment 
In a telephone interview Beth Perry CISPES spokeswoman called 
suggestions that the group might have had a connection to the 
bombings absolutely ridiculous 
She said some literature on the Capitol bombing was passed out 
at a CISPESsponsored demonstration five days after the bombing 
but that the group had nothing to do with distributing that 
material 
Other FBI documents show the bureau monitored a radio show on 
which a CISPES member appeared and tracked down people named in 
newspaper articles 
The files also show that the FBI switched from conducting an 
investigation of alleged criminal investigations of domestic 
security laws to an international terrorism investigation in 1983 
At the time of the switchover thenFBI Director William Webster 
was assuring the public and Congress that the FBI would require 
more than political rhetoric before it began investigating domestic 
political groups 
Webster now head of the CIA has refused to comment on the 
investigation referring all questions back to the FBI 
The international terrorism probe gave the FBI far more sweeping 
authority to investigate US citizens But a proviso in the 
attorney generals guidelines for such probes still states that 
no United States person may be considered a foreign power or an 
agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities 
protected by the First Amendment 
FBI headquarters in Washington apparently was concerned that the 
field offices did not understand that they could be infringing on 
First Amendment rights 
In a memorandum to all field offices dated July 26 1984 the 
FBI director writes It is imperative that these investigations 
are closely supervised and monitored to ensure our investigations 
do not infringe upon the rights of these individuals or groups 
protected by the Constitution 
Some offices have reported information recently regarding 
political statements and political lobbying by CISPES or CISPES 
affiliates the director continues Supervisors must 
carefully monitor this and related investigations and assess 
operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate 
direction targeting and reporting 
Still a month later the Denver field office wrote that it 
concurs with New Orleans that in spite of attempts by the bureau 
to clarify guidelines and goals for this investigation the field 
is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political 
activity can be monitored 
Asked about the investigation FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney 
denied it was political saying it had a narrow focus and was 
limited to those leaders and key members of CISPES to ascertain if 
they were involved in illegal support of the FMLN a foreign 
terrorist organization 
The FMLN is the Frente Farabundo Marti Para La Liberacion 
Nacional a resistance group fighting the USbacked government of 
El Salvador
