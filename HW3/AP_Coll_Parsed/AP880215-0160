Iraq said its air force attacked Iranian 
troops along the front Monday while Iran claimed its warplanes 
blasted a petrochemical complex and military installations in 
southern Iraq 
Iraq also claimed its forces shot down two Iranian drones 
Reports by Iran and Iraq which have been at war since September 
1980 cannot be independently verified because they rarely allow 
access to combat zones 
The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military communique as 
saying Iraqi jets flew 60 combat missions along the war front 
inflicting substantial losses in men weaponry and equipment 
then returned safely to base 
It said Iraqi helicopter gunships rocketed and strafed Iranian 
military posts in 39 sorties destroying many of the enemys 
troop buildups and positions It gave no details 
The agency monitored in Nicosia reported that Iraqi 
antiaircraft gunners shot down two Iranian drones at different 
times Sunday night One fell inside Iranian territory and another 
crashed in Iraq according to the communique It did not elaborate 
Iran did not comment on the Iraqi claims A communique issued in 
Tehran said the Iranian air force effectively carried out 
reconnaissance flights over the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman 
Sunday to provide air cover for the navy and reconnoiter positions 
of foreign vessels in the waterway 
The Iranian communique carried by the official Islamic Republic 
News Agency said Iranian warplanes heavily bombarded Iraqi 
positions and fortifications along the southern front east of the 
Iraqi city of Basra and in Faw Peninsula farther south 
Iranian warplanes also attacked a petrochemical complex in Basra 
in one of five raids carried out by early afternoon Monday IRNA 
said in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia 
All the attacking fighters returned safely to bases after 
inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the enemy the agency 
quoted a communique as saying 
Irans air force is outnumbered 8to1 by Iraqs fleet of 
Soviet and Frenchmade aircraft But in recent weeks Iran has 
used its USmade planes in several raids suggesting Tehran may 
have bought spare parts on the black market 
Iran has 6070 operational warplanes according to Western 
military analysts 
Iraq has previously reported shooting down other Iranian drones 
Iran recently reported successful tests of domestically built 
drones but it is not known whether it is producing its own 
pilotless aircraft yet It also has reported its war factories are 
preparing to manufacture fighter planes 
The Iranians apparently stepped up efforts to manufacture their 
own weapons after the United States proposed an international arms 
embargo against the Islamic nation to force its rulers to agree to 
a UN Security Council ceasefire resolution 
Iraq has accepted Security Council Resolution 598 which passed 
on July 20 Iran said it wants Baghdad condemned as the aggressor 
before any settlement can be reached
