Sen Paul Simon will skip tonights Democratic 
presidential debate in Texas to devote complete attention to 
Minnesota and South Dakota ahead of caucuses and primaries in those 
states next Tuesday an aide said today 
The debate in Dallas is the first major event on the calendar 
prior to the pivotal Super Tuesday round of contests 
Though Simon edged away from his statement Wednesday that he had 
to win either Minnesota or South Dakota to stay in the race it is 
apparent the Illinois senator is banking his future hopes on good 
showings in those states 
Simon concentrated on raising money Wednesday night and 
Thursday picking up about 150000 in Chicago and moving on to St 
Louis this morning 
Aide David Carle said Simon collected 250000 last week and 
hoped to gather another 400000 in a series of fundraisers this 
week 
Carle said Simon has already made 10 trips to Texas and saw no 
need to attend tonights debate 
Simon began Wednesday telling television interviewers that he 
had to finish first in Tuesdays Minnesota caucuses or South Dakota 
primary to stay in the contest for his partys nomination 
Later addressing an airport rally at which about 100 
supporters greeted him with signs urging Hang Tough Paul 
Simon said he was disappointed in his secondplace finish in the 
Iowa caucuses Feb 8 and in his thirdplace finish in New 
Hampshires primary Tuesday 
Those losses he said came by a total of fewer than 6000 votes 
Its like getting on the onefoot line and you dont quite 
score that touchdown he said adding I have to win next 
Tuesday in either Minnesota or South Dakota 
By late Wednesday night however he was telling reporters at a 
series of fundraisers Were now hedging on that because of the 
reaction weve been getting from around the country 
He also said he planned to run in his homestate Illinois 
primary March 15 
As for Minnesota Simon said he was optimistic about his 
chances He told a St Paul news conference that the place where 
my natural roots are is right here in Hubert Humphrey land 
So far Simon said he has 35 delegates in the race for the 
Democratic presidential nomination Missouri Rep Richard Gephardt 
has 38 and Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis has 48 he said 
Simon finished second in Iowa behind Gephardt and third in New 
Hampshire behind Dukakis and Gephardt 
In terms of delegates its almost a threeway tie right now 
but you cant continue to run second and third indefinitely 
thats part of reality he said 
Aides said Simons campaign has debts of about 500000 with 
about 200000 on hand and expects to raise 300000 to 400000 
this week including about 150000 at fundraisers in Chicago and 
St Louis before heading back to Minnesota today
