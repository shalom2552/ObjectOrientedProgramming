Kevin Spacey who has been wowing TV audiences 
with his portrayal of brilliant bedeviled bad guy Mel Profitt on 
CBS Wiseguy had a tough act to follow 
Ray Sharkey had created one of the seasons best villains in 
Sonny Steelgrave a tough New Jerseybased crime boss who turned 
out to be so lovable that undercover hero Vinnie Terranova Ken 
Wahl wept when he died 
But Steelgrave was gone and Vinnie had to have a new 
investigation 
Enter Mel and Susan Profitt Joan Severance a bizarre 
brothersister act with an international crime syndicate and a 
vaguely incestuous relationship 
Mel a manicdepressive with a genius IQ gets his 
selfdestruction wish in Mondays episode The finite role is what 
appealed to Spacey 
I was really attracted to be able to go and do a role for a 
number of weeks find out what it was like to do a TV series but 
not be tied to one create a character that hopefully will be 
memorable and get out Spacey said recently back home in 
Manhattan 
You know the crew theyre the biggest critics they not only 
were in love with the character Sonny Steelgrave they knew Ray 
and they hung out with Ray and they were like Rays pal and 
here was this New York actor coming in 
By his last day on the set Spacey said one of the crew 
members came up and said You know when you came on we thought 
no one would ever make us forget uh Whats his name I 
thought that was a really great compliment 
If Spacey won over the Wiseguy crew he also won over 
audiences Back in New York he said people were stopping him on 
the street and quoting lines from the show to him 
Wiseguy premiered last fall on Thursday opposite NBCs 
highrated lineup so it didnt get much attention But with the 
introduction of the Profitts midseason CBS moved it to Monday 
night where it is doing better 
Spacey a dedicated New York stage actor had little screen time 
before the series He starred on Broadway in Hurly Burly and 
later with Jack Lemmon in Long Days Journey Into Night a 
performance that can be seen later this season on PBS He worked 
with Lemmon again in NBCs recent miniseries The Murder of Mary 
Phagan Spacey played a newspaper reporter 
He has a movie due out in April Rocket Gibraltar in which 
he plays Burt Lancasters son a standup comic Spacey in fact 
did standup as an impressionist in Los Angeles His specialty is 
Johnny Carson but he also does a mean Katharine Hepburn 
Spacey went to Vancouver to shoot Wiseguy A number of film 
projects have moved to Canada because of lower production costs 
I travel with a large black Labrador named Slate Spacey 
said My dogs traveled all over the world and hes this 
incredible like East Side dog I found him as a stray in 81 And 
I hate hotel life its too busy So I went on the hunt and found 
this great apartment very quiet and secluded down near the largest 
park in Vancouver Stanley Park I thought great no actors 
Nobody knows about it 
I get in the elevator the first day Im living there and 
Katharine Hepburn is standing in it 
Hepburn was shooting an NBC movie Spacey notes casually that he 
and Hepburn knew each other already 
When he was 15 Spacey said he saw Hepburn in a Los Angeles 
production of A Matter of Gravity He waited for her in the 
parking lot with a bouquet of flowers The gesture won him a few 
precious minutes with the actress 
After a performance of Long Days Journey Hepburn came 
backstage to congratulate the actors Spacey said he was too choked 
up to mention their meeting of years before 
But the next day he sent her another bouquet with a letter He 
got a note back he said which in typical Hepburn style noted it 
was the first time she had received flowers for simply attending 
the theater not performing Since then the two have stayed in 
touch

Edward Hunsberger and features deaf actors Mary Vreeland Howie 
Sego David Balachier and Solly Brandt Director James Whitmore Jr
