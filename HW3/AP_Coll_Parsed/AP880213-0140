A man who doesnt believe in lotteries 
and wouldnt spend 1 on a ticket became Floridas first 1 million 
lottery winner Saturday thanks to a ticket he found on the ground 
You cannot beat dumb luck said Tom Sawyer 45 after 
beating six other finalists in a random drawing for the top cash 
prize 
If I had 5 that I was going to spend Id rather go to a 
twohour movie than spend a minute and a half scratching off five 
tickets he said 
Sawyer found the ticket on the ground outside his paint store 
and scratched off the covering to find the word ENTRY three 
times Tickets with that combination were to be mailed in for a 
drawing and in spite of Sawyers feelings he didnt hesitate to 
send it in 
I send in to Publishers Clearinghouse for a 22cent stamp 
you always have a chance he said 
His was one of 460000 tickets mailed in Gov Bob Martinez last 
week picked seven out of a barrel to be on Saturdays award show 
Sawyer called himself fantastically lucky and said he would 
use his winnings to educate his children two whom are approaching 
college age One daughter is engaged so he expects to pay for a 
wedding soon He said 10 percent would go to his church 
Sawyer said he still wont support the lottery or buy a ticket 
He voted against it and maintains those who play are the ones who 
can least afford it 
If youve got all your obligations taken care of and thats 
how you want to handle your spendable income thats fine Sawyer 
said I have no problem with that What I believe is for me and 
Im not trying to lay that on you 
He said he doesnt expect the winnings to change his lifestyle 
and expected to be back at work Monday but he conceded that he 
will probably have to get an unlisted telephone number 
The game of chance began Jan 12 The second 1 million 
Millionaire drawing will be held in about a month
