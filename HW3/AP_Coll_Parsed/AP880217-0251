As lawyers for three tobacco companies and a 
man suing them for his wifes cancer death do battle inside a 
federal courtroom another struggle goes on outside this one waged 
by a squad of public relations people 
At each break in the proceedings PR specialists for the 
companies buttonhole reporters covering the trial drop by the 
courthouse press room to say hello and make sure no questions 
need to be answered and happily provide transcripts of testimony 
favorable to their side with key passages highlighted 
The 22 billionayear tobacco industry has never shrunk from 
getting its message across but some observers say this trial 
involving Liggett Group Inc Philip Morris Co and Lorillard Inc 
presents an especially striking image problem 
Lawyers for the man suing the three companies have spent 4 
years gathering an unprecedented quantity of confidential internal 
corporate documents and interviewing key company officials 
In the first two weeks of the trial for example jurors have 
seen notes by a Liggett vice president saying that selling a safer 
cigarette would increase the risk of cancer lawsuits involving 
existing products 
A memo describing a meeting of Liggett officials and consultants 
says the company wanted to sell cigarettes so we must get over 
the hurdle of linking smoking and lung cancer 
Last Thursday the jury heard testimony from an assistant 
research director of Liggett saying that the company blocked 
publication of research on a safer cigarette and his participation 
in a scientific conference 
The trial is likely to last two to four months 
The documents and testimony were introduced to bolster Antonio 
Cipollones contention that Liggett Philip Morris and Lorillard 
were responsible for the lungcancer death of his wife Rose a 
40year smoker 
Cipollone charges in part that the companies failed to do enough 
research on the health effects of smoking to disclose adequately 
what research they did or to put a safer cigarette on the market 
Cipollone doesnt have a PR staff but his two lawyers and their 
courtroom staff of three dont stint on meeting the needs of 
reporters They readily present their interpretation of the days 
evidence during courtroom breaks and make available copies of 
documents deemed newsworthy as soon as US District Judge H Lee 
Sarokin enters them into evidence 
Does the trial truly present an image problem for the industry 
No I dont think so said John Scanlon one of five PR 
professionals working on behalf of the tobacco companies They 
attend court nearly every day and work out of an office rented in 
downtown Newark 
A lawyer from the prominent Kansas City firm of Shook Hardy amp 
Bacon is also on hand to answer all legal questions from reporters 
Inside the courtroom a team of nine attorneys handles the defense 
Our purpose here is just to keep things as clean as possible 
in terms of trying to keep the story straight said Scanlon the 
52yearold senior vice president of the international PR firm 
Daniel J Edelman Inc 
Scanlon has made his mark in the field in recent years by 
presenting litigants positions from courthouse steps while lawyers 
handle the juries inside 
The bearded straighttalking member of former New York City 
Mayor John Lindsays administration handled the media in highly 
publicized libel trials for CBS the Boston Globe and McClatchy 
newspapers 
Our role is to present a balanced objective picture of 
whats going on said Scanlon colleague Alan Hilburg who has his 
own PR firm in Dallas and a joint venture in New York 
So many people enter with an anticigarette bias he said 
Hilburg represented Pennzoil Co in its legal battle with energy 
giant Texaco Inc and worked on Johnson amp Johnsons campaign to 
recover from the devastation of the Tylenoltampering incidents 
Image could have an impact on Wall Street Some analysts have 
said a legal loss in the suit which would be the industrys first 
in such a case could lower the value of tobacco company stocks 
However said analyst Neal Kaplan of Interstate Securities Corp 
in Charlotte NC Its hard to picture the tobacco companies 
image as suffering because I dont think they have good images
