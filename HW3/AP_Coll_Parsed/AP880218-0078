An 81yearold widow in failing health has 
pleaded guilty to wounding her retarded son in a bungled mercy 
killing attempt she said was necessary because she loved him too 
much to leave him behind 
Sometimes a mothers love puts people in strange 
situations Circuit Judge William D Block said before sentencing 
Geraldine M Sagel of Ingleside to 30 months of probation 
Ms Sagel is required to live in the Round Lake Beach nursing 
home that has been her home since her arrest in October but she 
will be allowed supervised visits with her son Block said 
Her son Jack 51 lives at the Waukegan Developmental Center 
Authorities said Ms Sagels bullet went through his shoulder 
instead of his heart 
I am very sorry that it ever happened the wheelchairbound 
widow said before her sentencing on a charge of aggravated battery 
Wednesday I didnt want to leave him behind I was going blind 
and my health was failng by the day and I was afraid that being 
the way he is that he would be at the mercy of the world 
I didnt want that Your Honor she told the judge I love 
him too much for that I think you can understand that 
Oh I think anyone with children can understand that Block 
replied 
Ms Sagel could have been sentenced to a maximum of 53 years in 
prison 
A grand jury declined to indict her on the more serious charge 
of attempted murder which carries a mandatory prison sentence of 
six to 30 years 
I dont think society can condone what she did said 
Prosecutor Michael J Waller said But you can empathize with her 
feelings I dont have any qualms about the outcome 
Ms Sagel was a racecar driver in the 1920s a dancer at the 
1934 Chicago Worlds Fair and says she was the first woman to 
skydive from a biplane She said she spent most of her life caring 
for her son because she did not trust anyone else 
The state is paying for her sons care now and Ms Sagel will 
live on money from the sale of her small house her lawyer said
