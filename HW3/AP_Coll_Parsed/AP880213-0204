The recent sharp downturn in interest rates has 
sent corporate America on a borrowing spree 
Theres been no really big issues but a steady activity 
among all the highergrade to mediumgrade companies explained 
Anthony Naylor a corporate bond analyst for Rodman amp Renshaw Inc 
People had been waiting some time to see something happen 
During the final week of 1987 only a couple of issues were put 
on the market totaling 15206 million according to Securities 
Data Co Inc which compiles financial information 
But by the following week the number of issues jumped to 30 
valued at 276 billion and in the last seven days of January they 
peaked at 76 totaling 556 billion Securities Data said 
Activity slowed slightly this past week due to what traders 
described as a general malaise in the credit markets prior to the 
release of December trade figures on Friday 
The sudden spurt in volume had been prompted largely by the 
rapid fall in interest rates and subsequent rise in bond prices 
which paralleled a growing spate of negative economic news 
Traders in the credit markets believe that the Federal Reserve 
remains poised to keep rates low to avoid sending the economy into 
a recession Rates had been on the rise until the Oct 19 stock 
market crash In the Treasury market alone the yield on the 
bellwether 30year bond had been nearing 10 perlcent before the 
crash and its now trading slightly above 8 percent 
Its almost the same as you or I dealing with our finances 
when we see rates come down we decide at some point its 
attractive enough to take action said James J Drury a 
corporate bond analyst with PrudentialBache Securities Inc 
A lot of corporate treasurers are thinking nows a good time 
to get into the market because the odds are that either rates wont 
go down much more or they might go up in the short term 
Among the companies jumping into the market were General 
Electric Capital Corp which issued 300 million in debt in early 
January Quantum Chemical which issued the same amount a week 
later and General Motors Acceptance Corp which issued 200 
million in notes earlier this month 
Analysts say most of the bond issues have been for capital 
spending or stock repurchases rather than for refunding of previous 
debt 
Some have put the money from the issues in their corporate 
kitties for use down the road and what we call prefunding said 
Drury 
Meanwhile investors fortunate enough to have bought bonds prior 
to the recent rate decline have seen their securities rise in value 
Moodys Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer has risen about 6 percent since the start of the year 
Jon Cuscani who runs Nikko Securities Co Intl Incs 
corporate bond trading notes that HydroQuebecs 30year bond sold 
for around 991 per 1000 face amount and yielded 1081 percent 
when issued about the time of the crash Lately each of those 
bonds has sold for around 1100 he said
