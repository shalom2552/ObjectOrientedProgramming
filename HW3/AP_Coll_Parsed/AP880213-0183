Customs agents seized 14 tons of 
heroin hidden in bales of rubber sheets bound for New York in what 
is believed to be the worlds largest heroin bust officials said 
Saturday 
The 2822 pounds of No 4 grade heroin with a street value of 2 
billion were aboard a freighter at Klong Toey Port in Bangkok 
said Viroj Laohaphan director general of the Customs Department 
No 4 grade heroin is 97 percent pure 
Viroj said the drug was discovered when customs officials 
acting on a tip began opening the 665 bales earlier this week 
Heroin had been found in 62 bales by the time the search was 
completed Friday night he told a news conference 
The packing in rubber sheets prevented police dogs from 
smelling the heroin Viroj said If this amount of heroin had 
left Thailand it would have killed an uncountable number of 
people 
Viroj said Thai authorities have questioned an employee of the 
shipping company but made no arrests 
The ship was to leave for New York later this month authorities 
said 
Customs officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
rainstorm Thursday aroused suspicions about the cargo The 
officials said nothing was found until officials noticed the white 
powder seeping out of bales wet with rain and noticed that some 
soaked bales weighed more than others 
Viroj said the previous largest heroin bust was of 2640 pounds 
seized in France in 1972 
Ross Petzing spokesman for the US Embassy in Bangkok said 
the biggest previous heroin seizure that US Drug Enforcement 
Administration officials in Thailand could recall was a haul also 
of 2640 pounds 
That seizure was made several years ago on a shrimp boat off the 
coast of a Central American country Petzing said He said he had 
no further details of that bust 
Petzing said No 4 grade heroin cut diluted and sold on the 
streets of New York would fetch about 16 million a kilogram 
which equals 22 pounds He quoted DEA agents as saying the drug 
probably was bought in northern Thailand for about 4400 a kilo 
The officials said the heroin was believed to have come from 
Southeast Asias Golden Triangle a major drug producing 
region where the borders of Thailand Laos and Burma converge 
He said the rubber bales were to have been exported by the 
Rubber Plus ImportExport Company to the AIC Company in the New 
York City borough of Queens He said US authorities had inspected 
300 bales at the companys Elmhurst Queens warehouse but did not 
find incriminating evidence 
Viroj said he received information however that a woman 
representative of AIC was arrested 
News reports said the manager of the Rubber Plus ImportExport 
had disappeared and police found its offices in Bangkok deserted 
Thai authorities seized 1496 pounds of heroin aboard a trawler 
off the southern province of Chumphon last Oct 20 in what was then 
described as Thailands biggest heroin bust
