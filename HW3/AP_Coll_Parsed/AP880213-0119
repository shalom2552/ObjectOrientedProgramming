Its not safe to be mayor in this western 
Nebraska community of 10000 There have been three of them in 37 
days and two of them were recalled 
This office is scared Im scared I dont know if this stuff 
is going to die said Kevin Horn executive director of the 
Chamber of Commerce 
Horn and other community leaders are worried about the citys 
image and how it will attract new residents and businesses 
I was 100 150 miles from home and people would laugh heres 
the Alliance guy Whats going on up there said Hal Murray a 
liquor salesman who was an organizer of the first recall drive 
Antidrug crusader Dick Zellaha was ousted as mayor in that 
recall on Dec 15 and his successor rival Duane Worley was 
officially recalled Jan 20 
Car salesman Richard Robb appointed to the City Council in 
October to fill a vacancy is the latest to hold the title of 
mayor a ceremonial job that pays only 575 a year 
The mayor serves as president of the City Council while City 
Manager Wolfgang Bauer runs the towns daytoday business 
I think the key word for Alliance at this point is 
polarized said Horn who was warned before moving to Alliance 
to take the Chamber job that this was a community that would 
fight 
Since Omaha Mayor Mike Boyle was recalled in January 1987 the 
state has seen a big increase in recall elections of mayors city 
councilmen school board members and other elected officials The 
Omaha recall was considered a trigger to many of the other recalls 
all in small communities 
According to a study by a legislative committee there were 11 
recall elections in the state from 1984 through 1986 In 1987 
there were 17 
The Nebraska Legislature is considering a bill that would make 
it tougher to recall an elected official The bill would require 
petition groups to state reasons for the recall and the reasons 
would have to be more serious than mere disagreement with the 
officials voting record 
At the center of the Alliance controversy is Zellaha 49 a 
former department store manager and onetime amateur boxer who 
called himself The Great Lakes Mauler 
Zellaha who is unemployed but supports himself with investments 
and his wifes salary believes he was recalled because people were 
jealous of the attention his antidrug campaign received including 
a letter from first lady Nancy Reagan 
His opponents said the problem was much deeper They accused him 
of unethically and illegally using his office to promote his 
personal gain 
Council members elected Zellaha mayor in December 1986 and one 
month later his son was seriously injured in a traffic accident 
Shane Zellaha now 25 owned up to a drug problem and father and 
son began giving talks on drug abuse 
Critics said Zellaha wasnt able to separate his personal 
campaign from his responsibilities as mayor The recall committee 
also accused him of harassing the police department shouting at 
meetings misusing city stationery and postage and bringing 
ridicule to the city 
Asked if he did anything in office that was illegal or 
unethical he replied Oh heavens no heavens no I never did 
Worley and Council member Wendy Fierstein were recalled for 
allegedly not honoring a groups request that electrical rates be 
lowered and that the city manager be fired 
Worley said Bauer had done nothing to warrant firing He also 
said the city was working to adjust the electrical rates 
Worley whose recall was the work of another committee said he 
is disturbed by the publicity the recalls have created 
The acting mayors council seat and three others are up for 
election this year with the primary on May 10 Robb wont say if 
hell run Zellaha has promised his wife he wont run but their son 
is a candidate 
This would have been a good place to do two things a study on 
government and another one on psychology said Bauer How 
the psychology of this whole thing worked and how it transpired 
and what the emotions were and how ugly it got
