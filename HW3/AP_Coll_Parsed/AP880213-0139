the instruments potential and inspired composers to write music to 
showcase it has died at age 90 his family said Saturday

Raymond Cooke 
The Liverpool native was the son of conductor Eugene Goossens 
He began studying the oboe when he was 10 years old and at 16 was 
offered a place with the Queens Hall Orchestra by Sir Henry Wood 
By the next year he was principal oboist and had already begun 
to redefine the oboes role as an orchestral instrument 
Goossens was part of a family rich in musical talent He is 
survived by his two sisters both harpists Marie 93 and Sidonie 
87 who was principal harpist with the British Broadcastng Corp 
Symphony Orchestra for 50 years 
Goossens joined the Liverpool Orchestra which paid him 22 cents 
a night plus an extra 9 cents for tackling the cor anglais solo in 
Rossinis William Tell Overture 
He played with some of the finest orchestras of the day and by 
1927 after joining Sir Thomas Beecham at the London Philharmonic 
he became a soloist 
His playing inspired many original works for the oboe Among the 
composers who dedicated works to him were Benjamin Britten Francis 
Poulenc and Sir Edward Elgar whose 1934 Soliloquy for Oboe and 
Strings one of his last works was composed in honor of his friend 
Goossens 
The oboist was made a Commander of the Order of the British 
Empire in 1950 and received the Cobbett Medal for services to 
Chamber Music in 1954 He toured the world until 1962 when a 
serious car crash temporarily halted his career 
Goossens played and recorded for many top orchestras and bands 
including Jack Hyltons jazz orchestra at Londons plush Kit Kat 
Club 
His other interest was sailing and he was a stalwart of the 
London Corinthian Sailing Club 
Goossens wife of 52 years the former Leslie Burrows died in 
1985 
He was the finest woodwind instrumentalist this country has 
ever produced said James Brown 58 oboist with the English 
Chamber Orchestra He was a great influence not only on myself 
but on woodwind playing in general 
Celebrated clarinetist Jack Brymer 73 said Goossens did more 
for the development of woodwind playing throughout the world than 
any other person When I became a professional musician I became 
friends with him and he was not only a great musician but a 
humorous and pleasant individual 
He opted out of the orchestral world at a fairly early age 
but remained a great soloist almost to the end of his very long 
life
