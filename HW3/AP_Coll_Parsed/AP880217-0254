A proposed merger of the tiremaking divisions of 
Firestone Tire amp Rubber Co and Tokyobased Bridgestone Corp would 
give a Japanese company control of the worlds thirdlargest tire 
company experts say 
Firestone which was fifth in worldwide tire sales in 1986 
announced the plan to merge its tire business with No 3 
Bridgestone on Tuesday 
Based on 1986 tire sales figures the most recent available 
of 23 billion for Firestone and about 31 billion for 
Bridgestone the proposed Firestone Tire Co would rank third 
behind Goodyear Tire amp Rubber Co of the United States and Michelin 
of France 
More important the joint venture with majority ownership by 
Bridgestone would give the Japanese company a share of the US 
originalequipment tire market said Ed Noga editor of the 
industry trade journal Rubber amp Plastics News 
Bridgestone is an aggressive company that wants to grow in the 
United States and they wanted to get access to the 
originalequipment market Noga said in a telephone interview 
from Akron Ohio where Firestones tire division is based 
Chicagobased Firestone has been successful in obtaining 
originalequipment contracts meaning it supplies tires to car and 
truck manufacturers to be used on new vehicles 
Firestone made the surprise announcement of an agreement in 
principle with Bridgestone and said it would enter into formal 
negotiations immediately to reach a final agreement 
Firestone stock soared 925 to 45 a share in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Tuesday following the disclosure 
The announcement came amid speculation that Firestone would sell 
its tire division to the Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli SpA 
Bridgestone would own about 75 percent of the company and 
Firestone 25 percent 
The two companies plan to operate the joint venture doing 
business worldwide as Firestone Tire Co as a relatively 
autonomous business unit subject to the direction and control of a 
board of directors consisting of persons representing the owners 
the statement said 
Under the tentative agreement the joint venture would be 
initially financed with 750 million in equity from Bridgestone 
250 million from Firestone and 500 million in debt 
The agreement also calls for Firestone to transfer tire assets 
and liabilities with an equity value of about 15 billion to the 
joint venture 
After spinning off the tire business Firestone would still 
retain its 1500 carcare centers Firestone Diversified Products 
which includes divisions that manufacture industrial and building 
products Firestone Synthetic Rubber and Latex Co which 
manufactures synthetic rubber and operates a rubber plantation in 
Liberia and Firestone Car Rental Inc 
The Firestone tire division employs 30000 people worldwide 
said spokesman Robert Troyer The rest of Firestones businesses 
employ 23500 he said 
The creation of the joint venture is expected to generate more 
than 1 billion in cash for the parent Firestone Tire amp Rubber Co 
the company said 
Once final agreement with Bridgestone is reached Firestone 
would schedule a special shareholders meeting to seek approval of 
the joint venture 
The company also would ask shareholders to approve a financial 
restructuring that would distribute a very substantial portion of 
the cash generated by the transaction to Firestone shareholders 
the statement said 
The joint ventures headquarters would be located in Akron and 
would be assigned the exclusive right to use Firestones name on 
tires throughout the world 
In a related move Tuesday Firestones board adopted a poison 
pill antitakeover plan to guard against unfriendly suitors 
The plan would take effect if any person or group buys 20 
percent or more of Firestones common stock without the approval of 
the companys board of directors The Firestone statement said the 
antitakeover plan was intended both to ensure that Firestones 
shareholders will retain the benefits of a joint venture with 
Bridgestone and to protect the full value of its shareholders 
investment in the company 
Firestone is the thirdlargest USbased tire manufacturer 
behind Goodyear and BF Goodrich Co 
Bridgestone held a 2 percent share of the US replacement 
passenger tire market last year and had a 7 percent share of the 
US replacement truck tire market according to Modern Tire 
Journal an industry publication 
Bridgestone is in the process of moving its Bridgestone USA 
Tire Inc headquarters from Torrance Calif to LaVergne Tenn 
where it operates its sole US manufacturing plant a trucktire 
factory said Greg Smith publisher of Modern Tire Journal 
Firestone put its tire division in a freestanding position last 
November when the top headquarters staff relocated from Akron to 
Chicago and the company will seek shareholder approval next month 
to change the name of the company to Firestone Inc
