An Afghan guerrilla leader today 
urged Pakistan not to sign an agreement to end the civil war in 
Afghanistan unless an opposition government is established there 
first 
It will be a historic blunder if Pakistan signs the Geneva 
peace agreements in their present forms Gulbaddin Hekmatyar 
chief of the Islamic Party guerrillas told a news conference 
Meanwhile a Soviet foreign ministry official accused Pakistan 
of trying to delay the pullout by demanding an agreement on the 
makeup of a new interim Afghan government 
A final round of the UNsponsored talks between Islamabad and 
Kabul is to open in Geneva on March 2 Negotiators are expected to 
try to reach peace agreements to end the eightyear war which has 
pitted the Moslem guerrillas against an estimated 115000 Soviet 
troops and a small Afghan army 
Pakistan the United States China and other countries support 
the guerrillas and are represented by Islamabad at the Geneva 
talks Soviet views are represented by officials from Kabul 
Hekmatyar who heads the largest group in the sevenparty 
guerrilla alliance headquartered in Pakistan said Islamabad should 
retain its present demand for a government dominated by the 
guerrillas and shared by other Afghans to be installed in Kabul 
before a peace accord is signed 
In a statement Feb 8 Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev offered 
to start withdrawing his troops on May 15 provided the peace 
agreements are signed by March 15 
He said that a pullout would not be contingent on a separate 
agreement on the makeup of a transitional Afghan government 
Hekmatyar said the proposal implied that the Moscowbacked 
government of President Najib would remain in power and the 
insurgents would play no role 
Gorbachevs proposal will cunningly leave the Najib government 
in power when the Soviets withdraw and Afghan refugees will be 
allowed to return home But it will not lead to peace said 
Hekmatyar considered among the most hardline of the guerrilla 
leaders 
Hekmatyar renewed the guerrillas call for Moscow to begin 
direct talks with the guerillas The Soviets and the insurgents he 
said are the only parties involved in the Afghan fighting 
Such negotiations could lead to the formation of an interim 
government which will organize elections to establish a permanent 
elected government and a parliament he said 
Hekmatyar said the seven guerrilla parties would draw up a list 
of people acceptable for the proposed government The names would 
include guerrillas Afghan refugees and Afghan Moslems and exclude 
communists he said 
In Moscow Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I Gerasimov said 
that Pakistan has been trying to delay the pullout by urging the 
Soviet Union to find a formula for a future Afghan government 
A domestic Afghan settlement is a cause for the Afghans 
themselves And it depends only on them which ways to choose for 
the purpose Gerasimov said 
Outside parties can assist the process but not at the expense 
of the withdrawal talks Gerasimov said in remarks reported by the 
Tass news agency 
He said the Pakistani sides attempts to keep away from 
concluding the Geneva process are tantamount to an intention to 
frustrate the entire Afghan settlement 
The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said in a statement Feb 16 that 
only by linking its withdrawal to an agreement on an interim 
government could the Soviet Union assure an end to the fighting 
Iranian President Ali Khamenei told the Soviet deputy foreign 
minister Vladimir Petrovsky that any pullout accord must prevent 
the United States and its allies from wielding influence in 
Afghanistan according to a report broadcast Tuesday by Tehrans 
Islamic Republic News Agency 
Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 replaced 
one proSoviet government with another and remained to fight the 
insurgents Many of the guerrilla groups fight from bases across 
the border in neighboring Pakistan
