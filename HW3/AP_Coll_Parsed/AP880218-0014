The budget President Reagan sent to Congress 
today isnt likely to survive long but it embodies a philosophy of 
government that he hopes will be a legacy of his administration 
It also demonstrates some changes in approach that the president 
has either embraced or had thrust upon him since he took office 
more than seven years ago 
The budget makes a strong pitch for Reagans longheld position 
that government should not perform functions which in his 
conservative view of things can be done better by private 
organizations 
It proposes for instance the complete privatization of 
military housing and construction of waste water treatment plants 
It also calls for a new private entity to mediate disputes that now 
choke the US Tax Court 
In line with his firm belief in an economy governed by market 
forces the president reiterates proposals to cut back federal 
programs that prop up commodity prices and protect farmers incomes 
And as he so often has he calls for the elimination of federal 
programs that he says are unneeded This time he lists nine of 
them ranging from the rural housing insurance fund to 
discretionary grants for urban mass transit 
Notable by its absence however is the idea which he put 
forward in 1982 of abolishing the Department of Education 
Instead the president proposes an increase of 650 million over 
the current appropriation of 162 billion for the departments 
discretionary programs 
Adopting arguments of Secretary of Education William Bennett 
Reagan now says education and training are one of the highest 
priorities of the federal government 
Under a compromise worked out with Congress the president 
agrees to a slowdown in the military buildup that has been a 
hallmark of his administration But he pointedly says in his budget 
message that he wants the full 2295 billion compromise figure 
appropriated declaring I have kept my side of the bargain and 
trust that Congress will keep its side 
As he enters the twilight of his presidency Reagan has 
increasingly expressed his commitment most recently in a speech to 
conservative political activists last week to making what has been 
called the Reagan revolution of restrained government a 
permanent feature of American life 
However that may be the particulars of his budget blueprint 
undoubtedly are in for drastic alteration by a Congress controlled 
in both houses by the opposition party facing a president whose 
political clout is weakened as he nears the end of his tenure 
In his budget message the president says that the budget 
process has so degenerated in recent years that the presidential 
budget is routinely discarded after it arrives on Capitol Hill 
What the president calls degeneration many in Congress would 
describe as a healthy assertion of their constitutional power over 
the purse strings 
Either way however it makes the presidents budget more of an 
outline of goals and philosophy than a map of actual spending for 
the fiscal year that will begin Oct 1 and last for more than eight 
months after Reagan leaves office
