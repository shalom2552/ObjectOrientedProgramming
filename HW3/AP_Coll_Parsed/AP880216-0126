A glittering samba parade Tuesday 
highlighted Rios famous Carnival while in country towns ordinary 
Brazilians donned humble costumes and danced in the streets 
Police used clubs and tear gas to break up a rock fight among 
spectators leaving the samba school parade Three people were 
arrested and two hospitalized with injuries a police spokesman 
said 
A celebrant who may have been offended by the sexual tone of a 
television networks coverage of gala balls punched an anchorman 
during a live broadcast Among others the network had shown a 
woman from the waist up who wore only a silver tiara and said she 
was dressed as the Statue of Liberty 
The last of Rios top 16 samba schools paraded through the 
80000seat openair sambadrome at 9 am ending a twoday 
spectacular featuring 75000 brilliantly costumed participants who 
sang danced and pulled elaborate floats 
In the towns and villages the dances were much less elaborate 
but in many places local governments provided free street bands 
Carnival began Saturday and at noon Wednesday this nation of 
141 million people will begin the slow process of reopening 
businesses newspapers banks and government offices 
Daytime temperatures of more than 90 degrees aided the festive 
atmosphere Some costumed revelers ran short of energy and could be 
seen stretched out asleep on beaches sidewalks and parked cars 
Samba schools are neighborhood clubs most in the poor hillside 
slums that compete each year for a coveted local prize by 
composing sambas based on historical and folk themes Each school 
puts 40005000 people in the parade who relate the chosen theme 
through lyrics dances costumes and allegorical floats 
Many of the raucous club balls which attract tens of thousands 
of people were held Tuesday 
At the Scala nightclub a man punched Nei Costa of TV 
Bandeirantes a commercial network that was broadcasting three of 
the parties simultaneously 
Costa cried Ive been attacked I cant understand it and 
private security guards hustled the assailant off His name and 
complaint were not revealed 
Bandeirantes cut back and forth to reporters assigned to all 
three clubs providing closeups of bare and nearly bare breasts 
gyrating pelvises other scenes appropriate to leering commentary 
The Statue of Liberty appeared in the Bandeirantes broadcast 
from the Kittens Ball at the Monte Libano Club
