Ninetyfour Chinese couples tied the knot in two 
mass weddings Sunday Organizers said that while it was considered 
a lucky day to marry it was only coincidental the ceremonies 
landed on Valentines Day 
This kind of wedding has special meaning It is memorable 
because it is bigger and more exciting said Zhang Yongling one 
of 44 brides at the afternoon ceremony 
The Great Wall Sheraton Hotel organized the two ceremonies 
which fall three days before Spring Festival or Lunar New Year 
Spring Festival is considered an auspicious time for marriage 
and Chinese traditionally schedule weddings on evennumbered days 
which are said to be lucky 
Valentines Day is not celebrated in China but the master of 
ceremonies mentioned the Western holiday and explained its origin 
and significance to the newylweds 
The hotels elegant ballroom was decorated with colored 
streamers and two large red hearts for the ceremonies 
One bride wore a white wedding gown but all the others were in 
red the Chinese color for weddings A few wore traditional Chinese 
cheongsams a closefitting dress 
While friends and family threw colored confetti the couples 
bowed three times once to Beijing ViceMayor He Luli once to 
their parents and once to each other 
Mass weddings have been encouraged by the government which has 
been alarmed at the increasingly lavish weddings and receptions 
that couples are throwing 
According to Chinese reports young urban couples in some areas 
spend about 2000 on their weddings the equivalent of three 
years income 
By comparison the hotel charged about 27 per couple and 4 per 
guest 
For that amount the hotel provided a simple cake for each 
couple snacks and soft drinks and entertainment 
Some parents prefer the traditional wedding feast but Ms Zhang 
said My family is 80sminded
