A federal court jury began deliberations today 
on whether six men and two women are members of the Westies a gang 
of thugs that allegedly terrorized Manhattans Westside for two 
decades 
US District Judge Whitman Knapp turned the case over to the 
jury following lastminute instructions on how to conduct their 
deliberations The trial began last October 
A 17count racketeering indictment charged the eight defendants 
were members of a criminal enterprise that seized control of the 
Manhattan neighborhood once known as Hells Kitchen 20 years ago 
and held sway there through a series of murders and other crimes 
Among the crimes allegedly committed to further the Westiess 
goals were eight murders three attempted murders and five murder 
plots according to the indictment 
The indictment also listed 10 alleged coconspirators who had 
been killed before the charges were brought in March 
Prosecutors Mary Lee Warren and David Brodsky claimed the 
Westies had dismembered some victims bodies to enhance their 
reputation and eliminate competitors 
The government also claimed the Westies forged an alliance with 
the Gambino organized crime family said to be the nations most 
powerful and even shot a labor leader as a favor to reputed 
Gambino boss John Gotti 
But lawyers for reputed Westies boss James Coonan and his seven 
codefendants have denied the existence of the Westies as an 
organization 
Even government witnesses have conceded the name Westies was 
created by the police and news media to describe a group of mainly 
IrishAmerican hoodlums 
The defense also attacked the credibility of those prosecution 
witnesses admitted former gang members who turned informants in a 
bid for leniency Coonans attorney Gerald Shargel claimed all 
were unreliable because they were criminals seeking to cut a deal 
with the government
