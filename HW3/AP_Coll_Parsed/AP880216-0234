Directors of the Chicago Board of Trade voted 
Tuesday to reduce daily price limits for Major Market Index futures 
to 20 points and Institutional Index futures to 12 points 
The changes will become effective only if approved by the 
federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
A 20point move in the Major Market Index or a 12point move in 
the Institutional Index represents roughly 5 percent of the 
indexes present levels 
In recommending the move CBOT Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said 
the new limits would be more consistent with those in effect on 
stock index futures traded at other exchanges 
Last month the CBOT set permanent daily price limits on its 
stock index futures in an attempt to curb trading volatility that 
some critics say worsened the October stock market crash
