The Navy acknowledged late Friday that due 
to an oversight the remains of a Vietnam War victim had been 
transported from Hawaii to California this week without informing 
the mans widow 
The Navy and Pentagon also said they could not explain why a 
request by the widow to withhold public announcement of a military 
laboratorys identification of the remains had not been honored 
The widow Erna McKinney of San Diego Calif said Thursday in 
a telephone interview she had asked that the identification be 
withheld because she wanted to obtain a second opinion to verify 
the militarys forensic work 
Last Tuesday the Pentagon announced the Armys Central 
Identification Laboratory in Honolulu had succeeded in identifying 
six sets of remains repatriated to the United States from Vietnam 
One of the six the Pentagon said had been identified as Navy 
Lt Clemie McKinney an aviator who was lost over South Vietnam on 
April 14 1972 McKinney who was 26 listed his home as Cleveland 
Ohio at the time of his disappearance 
I told them I didnt want them to release the identification 
because I wasnt prepared to accept the finding that I wanted a 
second opinion said Mrs McKinney who contacted reporters after 
news stories about the Pentagons announcement appeared 
And then they did it anyway And then theyre bringing in the 
remains and nobody told me 
The remains of McKinney and the other five MIAs were transported 
from Hawaii to Travis Air Force Base Calif on Thursday 
Since McKinney was a Navy officer Navy officials were 
responsible for dealing with his nextofkin 
Lt Col Keith Schneider a Pentagon spokesman said Friday that 
Navy casualty assistance officers had earlier informed Mrs 
McKinney of the procedures that would be followed for transporting 
the remains 
Unfortunately due to an oversight the transportation 
arrangements were not confirmed to her before the public 
announcement Schneider said after consulting with Navy officials 
The spokesman said he did not know why Mrs McKinneys request 
to withhold public announcement of the identification was not 
honored 
All I can say is that we routinely abide by the familys 
desires on that point Schneider said If we had been aware of 
that request here at the Pentagon we would have made sure the 
identification was not released publicly 
Regretably there were misunderstandings or misinterpretations 
in this case and were now working with the family to remedy those 
We will work very closely with the nextofkin to satisfy their 
preferences and desires 
Mrs McKinney said she wanted to have the remains moved to 
another forensic scientist in Colorado for detailed examination 
Im not trying not to accept their identification she said 
Im just not ready to accept some of their evidence And thats 
why I didnt want their identification announced yet 
Although the work of the Armys laboratory has been verified for 
the most part there have been instances in which independent 
scientists concluded the laboratory did not have sufficient 
evidence to justify a finding of positive identification
