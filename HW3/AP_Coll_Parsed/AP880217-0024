The Agriculture Department is looking for 
state and local business partners to help share the cost of 
upgrading recreational facilities on national forest lands 
F Dale Robertson chief of the departments Forest Service 
said Tuesday the move is in response to increasing demands for more 
recreational areas and service and to help relieve pressures on 
federal spending 
The squeezed budget is a factor Robertson told a news 
conference 
A spokesman for an environmental group the Wilderness Society 
supported the agencys program but with some reservation 
There definitely needs to be greater emphasis on recreation 
and I would applaud efforts on the part of the Forest Service to 
increase the emphasis on recreation said Richard Rice a society 
economist I would urge them to use caution in opening the door 
to private development however 
Robertson said the Challenge CostShare Program was 
authorized by Congress on a pilot basis at a level of 500000 for 
the fiscal year that began last Oct 1 Of that 100000 was 
earmarked for the Tonto National Forest near Phoenix Ariz with 
the remainder available to other regions to supplement money put up 
by local people companies state agencies municipalities or other 
groups 
Some 31 recreation projects have been approved and will be under 
way this spring and summer he said Restoration and improvement of 
existing facilities areas and trails are typical goals 
The 500000 of Forest Service seed money was met with 908000 
from various partners involved in the 31 pilot projects 
One of the objectives of the program will be to provide more 
facilities on national forest land near cities 
Private investors will be encouraged to develop new campgrounds 
marinas ski areas No increase in user fees is being proposed at 
this time but that eventually will have to be faced he said 
Asked if the plan means opening the door for major private 
development on national forest land Robertson replied 
Yes we are opening that door but we also need to work with 
those private sector proposals to see if they fit into the overall 
scheme for recreation development 
The Forest Service administers 191 million acres or about 8 
percent of the US total land area 
Robertson said the proposed budget that President Reagan is 
scheduled to send Congress on Thursday for the 1989 fiscal year 
that will begin on Oct 1 will include 3 million for the 
recreation costshare program up from the 500000 in pilot funds 
this year One that began in 1986 for fish and wildlife will be 
requested at 5 million compared with 15 million in fiscal 1988
