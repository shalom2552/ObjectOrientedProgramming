More than 600 rebels using mortars 
grenades and automatic weapons attacked an infantry base and cotton 
cooperative early Wednesday in the biggest guerrilla operation 
since early 1987 
Officials said at least 18 people were killed and 14 wounded 
The battle raged in and around this provincial capital of 70000 
people 70 miles southeast of San Salvador the capital 
Military officers said two detachments of about 300 leftist 
insurgents each took part in the coordinated attacks which 
included blowing up two bridges linking the capital and Usulutan 
El Salvadors eastern province 
Seven members of a civilian family a couple and five children 
aged 7 months to nine years were killed when a mortar shell hit 
their oneroom brick and adobe home in a poor neighborhood just 
outside the 6th Infantry Brigade headquarters 
Col Inocencio Montano brigade commander said five soldiers 
were killed in combat at advance posts outside the base perimeter 
and no guerrillas penetrated the base The attack began at 1210 
am and lasted about three hours he said 
Montano said four of the 55 US military advisers stationed in 
El Salvador were at the base when the assault began but none was 
in danger 
He said the bodies of three guerrillas were brought to the base 
and two other bodies were removed by the retreating insurgents 
Radio Venceremos the clandestine rebel transmitter called the 
raid a success and claimed the attackers inflicted 190 casualties 
It gave no breakdown of dead and wounded 
The coordinated attacks appeared to be the largest in scale 
since the rebels hit the 4th Infantry Brigade in the northern 
province of Chalatenango last March 31 That battle cost 70 lives 
including that of a US military adviser and more than 100 people 
were wounded 
One member of the military National Police was killed in the 
attack on the Salvadoran Cotton Cooperative Ltd about 5 miles west 
of Usulutan 
Lt Jose Mejia Henriquez commander of the 30man detachment 
stationed at the cooperative said the assault began with mortar 
and rocketpropelled grenade fire at 1220 am 
Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front who 
began fighting the USbacked government eight years ago have 
waged a campaign of economic sabotage that includes attacks on the 
coffee cotton and sugar industries Those industries account for 
80 percent of El Salvadors export earnings 
Wednesdays attacks came hours before five Central American 
foreign ministers met at a San Salvador hotel to discuss progress 
in implementing a regional peace plan signed Aug 7 
Ricardo Acevedo Peralta host minister urged his colleagues to 
ensure that their countries comply with the plans prohibition of 
external aid to insurgents 
El Salvadors Christian Democratic government accuses 
neighboring Nicaragua of backing the Salvadoran rebels 
Guerrillas left leaflets on streets around the infantry base 
calling for popular insurrection and accusing President Jose 
Napoleon Duarte of selling national sovereignty to the United 
States 
The attacks effect was evident well into the afternoon Trucks 
full of soldiers with M16 assault rifles sped along dusty roads 
Helicopters and spotter planes flew overhead 
Montano said the guerrillas retreated to the north toward San 
Vicente volcano on whose slopes insurgents camp 
Lt Mejia at the cotton cooperative said the attack there began 
with about 15 minutes of mortar fire 
Then they attacked shouting like Indians he said on the 
porch of the cooperatives offices They shouted at us to 
surrender calling to me by my name that it was useless to resist 
He said he and his men held off the attackers from trenches at 
the front of the cooperative but guerrilla fighters penetrated 
from the sides and rear Seven of the units opensided warehouses 
were burned 
At the Palo Seco crossing 9 miles west of Usulutan peasants 
milled around a hole 50 feet long and 20 deep where a bridge had 
been the day before 
Residents said the they heard a tremendous explosion at about 
1230 am and rebels then blew down power poles on either side of 
the road 
Local officials reported skirmishes in at least three other 
provinces San Miguel Cabanas and Chalatenango 
Rebel radio said the attacks in San Miguel and the northeastern 
province of Morazan were part of a new operation they called
