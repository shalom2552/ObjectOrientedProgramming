Inmates angry over the conduct of searches at 
the Rikers Island city jail ransacked a dormitory but surrendered 
peacefully this morning after guards using tear gas and batons 
forced one group out 
Four inmates and four guards were injured but not seriously 
said Richard J Koehler city commissioner of correction 
The riot in the Anna M Kross Center which houses 2700 
inmates started at midnight and was over by 330 am he said 
Most of the 550 inmates involved were state prisoners in jail for 
parole violations Koehler said 
The inmates heavily damaged 12 dormitories which house about 50 
inmates each and 350 state inmates will have to be transferred out 
of the city They are being held in the gymnasium and other common 
areas until they can be moved 
The inmates shattered chairs tore apart doors and ripped beds 
from the walls using the pieces of broken furniture to smash all 
the lights he said 
We lost about 600 beds Koehler said at a news conference in 
a trailer outside the prison gates He could not estimate the cost 
of the damage and said it would take several days to repair it 
The riot apparently was sparked by a weapons search Wednesday 
morning during which seven state inmates had to be taken out of 
the dormitories because they objected to the search and 
interfered Koehler said 
Those inmates were returned Wednesday night to the dormitories 
where tensions were already high due to a stabbing earlier in the 
day 
At midnight Wednesday inmates in the four dormitories on the 
top floor began piling their beds and lockers against the door 
keeping guards out Inmates in the four dormitories on each of the 
other two floors followed suit 
No hostages were taken but when Supervising Warden James T 
Garvey Jr arrived to discuss the prisoners grievances they 
refused to talk and began breaking out of the dormitories into the 
facilitys hallways At that point Garvey decide to use force 
Koehler said 
Tear gas was fired into one dormitory Then 200 officers armed 
with batons and wearing plastic helmets and padded jackets moved 
into the room and began physically removing the inmates The 
inmates fought bac with chair legs broken glass and other weapons 
made from the shattered furniture Koehler said 
After the fight the inmates in the other 11 dormitories agreed 
to talk to the warden and the barricades came down around 330 
am he said 
Inmates complained that guards are using unnecessary force in 
weapons searches Koehler said 
Koehler and Robert Kasanof chairman of the city Board of 
Correction blamed the state prison system for the disturbance 
This is in my view a state riot which has been exported to the 
City of New York Kasanof said These are longterm prisoners 
for the most part for whom the city prisons are illdesigned and 
for whom the state prisons are welldesigned 
The citys prison system is currently at 101 percent of capacity 
with more than 15000 prisoners about 11000 of them at Rikers 
Koehler said
