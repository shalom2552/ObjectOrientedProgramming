An elderly landlord shackled by an electronic 
manacle brought new furniture and a security guard into his rundown 
apartment building as he began a courtordered stay for failing to 
fix leaky pipes and other problems 
Greeted by angry tenants and a banner reading Welcome You 
Reptile Morris Gross 77 began serving a 15day house arrest 
Friday in a Brooklyn building where tenants complain of bugs and 
rodents leaky ceilings and a lack of heat and hot water 
Gross who lives in a luxury highrise in the Brighton Beach 
section of Brooklyn made no comment to a group of tenants who 
shouted at him as he walked into the lobby wearing sunglasses and a 
gray scarf around his face 
We ask for so many things and they dont do anything said 
Errol Ramdeo who lives in apartment 5A 
Ramdeo said the door to the apartment where he lives with his 
parents is off its hinges bathroom tiles are falling off the wall 
and their stove doesnt work 
A civil court judge convicted Gross of criminal and civil 
contempt in December after the city Department of Housing 
Preservation and Development brought action against him for failing 
to comply with a court order to correct housing violations 
The judge gave him the choice of either paying 169000 in fines 
for 420 violations or serving 15 days of house arrest and spending 
137900 of the fines to repair the 113unit building in Brooklyns 
Flatbush neighborhood 
Gross will be confined to a fifthfloor apartment his movements 
monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet to make sure he serves 
his sentence 
When asked why Gross chose house arrest his attorney Stanley 
Kopilow said the landlord wanted to show to the judge and the 
community that this is not as bad as portrayed in the press 
On Thursday night after Gross decision was announced workers 
began repairs on apartment 5C including painting and plastering 
walls and installing new kitchen tiles 
Friday morning delivery men unloaded a new couch recliner 
chair and bureau from a truck which they said were to be delivered 
to Gross onebedroom apartment 
Gross meals will be catered tenants said and he will have a 
private security guard with him in the apartment for the duration 
of his sentence 
Lawrence Carelli the HPD attorney who handled the case said 
the only other case he knew in which a landlord was sentenced to 
live in his own building involved a 30day sentence handed down in 
Los Angeles last year 
He said there were still 400 outstanding violations in Gross 
building some dating back five years 
Joyce Stewart president of the tenants association pointed 
out a large hole in the ceiling of one apartment from which water 
comes down like crazy 
Another tenant Vivian Murray complained of flaking paint chips 
which she has discovered her 2yearold daughter eating 
Building superintendent Sydney Pilgrim while conceding that 
Gross is not an angel said the landlord had spent 1 million 
to repair the building 
We know he should not have let the building run down so far 
but work is getting done Pilgrim said 
Ms Stewart countered that cosmetic repairs had been done on 
only 10 to 12 apartments 
When you subtract that from 113 apartments youll see the 
real McCoy she said
