The jailed mother of an abandoned girl whose 
lower legs were amputated because of severe frostbite should be 
allowed to visit her hospitalized daughter according to a hospital 
counselor 
Darlwin Britt who is 24 and unemployed faces charges of felony 
child neglect and is being held in the Lake County Jail on 50000 
bond her lawyers have said she cant pay 
A hospital staff member says however that Ms Britts daughter 
needs to see her mother and that a supervised visit may help the 
girl recover 
The child Darlwin Carlisle 9 has talked with her mother once 
by telephone but has not seen her mother since the girl was found 
last month locked in an unheated and abandoned Gary apartment 
Her legs were amputated below the knee after gangrene threatened 
to develop into a possibly lifethreatening infection 
It needs to be done in a planned way said Mary Martone the 
coordinator of the child abuse program at Chicagos La Rabida 
Childrens Hospital and Research Center where the girl is learning 
to walk on artifical legs 
I basically think it would be appropriate for the parent and 
child to have contact she said in a recent interview 
The childs father Edward J Carlisle of Fort Wayne and other 
relatives have visited the child hospital officials say 
Others who believe Ms Britt should be allowed to visit her 
daughter include Gary City Councilman Roy Pratt Constance 
MackWard the director of the Gary Commission for Women and Jean 
Thurman director of Project Justice and Equality 
They contend the lack of support that mothers such as Ms Britt 
receive from the system is at least partly responsible for cases of 
child neglect and abuse 
We release condemned murderers to go to funerals said 
Pratt We release hardened criminals on bail I understand 
wanting to punish the mother I was angry too until I looked at 
the side of the mother
