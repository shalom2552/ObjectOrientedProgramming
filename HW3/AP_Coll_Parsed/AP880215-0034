President Reagans goal of free 
trade throughout North America continues to elude him despite nine 
meetings with Mexican presidents 
Reagan announced his dream of a North American free trade area 
embracing the United States Canada and Mexico when he declared his 
presidential candidacy for 1980 
In the intervening years he has presided over an agreement with 
Canada that would eliminate all tariffs and most other trade 
barriers between the United States and its neighbor to the north by 
1999 
But after repeated meetings with Mexican presidents his dream of 
extending such an agreement southward seems little closer to 
realization than when he first outlined it 
The trade pact signed last month by Reagan and Canadian Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney faces opposition in both countries and 
Saturdays meeting with Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid in 
Mazatlan produced scant movement in the trade area 
As the two leaders seated with their aides in canebottomed 
chairs at a long dining table in a seaside hotel rose to toast 
each other Reagan said their countries have taken steps toward a 
special trade and investment relationship 
One day I hope these steps will be seen as part of the 
historic evolution toward free and unimpeded trade and investment 
on this continent and in the Western Hemisphere the president 
said 
There are of course obstacles to overcome he added Both 
he and de la Madrid who devoted little of his lengthy toast to the 
trade issue mentioned the problem of Mexicos massive debt to 
commercial banks estimated by US officials at 105 billion 
There are other obstacles Mexicos economy is declining 35 
percent in 1986 and 15 percent in 1987 as measured by gross 
national product while the US ecomomy is growing 
Canadian critics of the trade agreement with the United States 
argue that it could make Canada an economic and cultural dependent 
of its neighbor to the south Between Mexico and the United States 
the mismatch is far greater 
We are not ready for free trade with Mexico Mexico is not 
ready Elliott Abrams assistant secretary of state for 
interAmerican affairs told reporters aboard Air Force One as 
Reagan flew to Mazatlan 
There was some progress US and Canadian officials signed a 
fouryear agreement that permits a 6 percent annual increase in 
quotas on textile and apparel imports from Mexico In return 
Mexico agreed to broaden access to its markets for US textiles 
and apparel 
Administration officials also had expected a telecommunications 
agreement covering mobile phone use along the border to be 
signed A lastminute hitch developed however after Reagan 
mentioned the planned signing in a prerecorded version of his 
weekly radio address 
As the president flew north for three days of relaxation at his 
ranch north of here Secretary of State George P Shultz told 
reporters in Mazatlan that the telecommunications agreement was 
basically completed but had not been put into final written 
form 
The agreements follow a number of others between the two 
countries 
Mexico has drawn praise from the United States for lowering its 
trade barriers and the United States has responded by opening up 
the US market to Mexican leather goods and other products 
De la Madrid has strongly pushed the marketopening moves as a 
way to help mend the sickly Mexican economy and pull it out of its 
lengthy crisis 
As Abrams said None of this is anything earth shaking but it 
is part of a larger process to keep the movement going in the 
direction of freer and freer trade 
Reagans meeting in Mazatlan was his sixth with de la Madrid He 
also met three times with the Mexican presidents predecessor Jose 
Lopez de Portillo Both presidents will leave office in a few 
months and Reagan said this meeting quite likely their last would 
help their successors to build on the foundation weve laid 
Abrams however conceded it was an open question whether 
the foundation would enable the next US and Mexican 
administrations to realize Reagans dream of a free trade agreement
