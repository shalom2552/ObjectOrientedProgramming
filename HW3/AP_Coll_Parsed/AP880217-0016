Leaving the snows of New Hampshire behind the 
presidential candidates set their sights today on the next big test 
the South with its highstakes Super Tuesday contests looming 
three weeks away 
On to the South where were going to rise again said Vice 
President George Bush fresh from his revival in New Hampshire 
Republican rival Bob Dole threatened to shatter what his 
campaign called a myth of invincibility surrounding the vice 
presidents organization in the South 
The change in scenery couldnt come too soon for Pat Robertson 
after his lastplace finish in New Hampshire Robertson a 
Virginian consoled his followers by saying Tomorrow morning we 
go into the South and theyre going to be playing in my backyard 
Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis coming off a strong 
firstplace finish in his neighboring state was conceding nothing 
to Democratic rivals Albert Gore Jr a Tennessean who is banking 
on his native Dixie and Jesse Jackson who has a strong base in 
the regions large black population 
Some people have been asking how a New Englander can hope to 
do well on Super Tuesday Dukakis said The fact of the matter 
is I dont have a Southern strategy I dont have a Northern 
strategy I have an American strategy 
Gore in Houston was the only one of the candidates not in New 
Hampshire Tuesday night We made a decision not to spend a 
million dollars on two or three delegates he told supporters 
After New Hampshire several candidates were heading to South 
Dakota Minnesota and Wyoming where lowerstakes contests are 
scheduled between now and March 8 But the big attentiongrabber is 
Super Tuesday March 8 when 20 states most of them in the South 
stage primaries or caucuses 
The delegate prize 1307 Democrats or more than half of the 
2082 needed to win the nomination and 700 Republicans also more 
than of the 1139 needed to nominate 
Gore has a favorite line about his decision to bypass Iowa and 
run a limited campaign in New Hampshire If youre going to go 
duck hunting you go where the ducks are If youre hunting for 
delegates you go where the delegates are 
Super Tuesday in a sense is Gores first stand and without a 
strong showing it could be his last 
We must do well on Super Tuesday theres no ifs ands or 
buts about it said his campaign manager Fred Martin 
Jackson who has solid black backing has taken the lead in some 
recent Southern surveys In Iowa and New Hampshire both of which 
have only tiny black populations Jackson notched respectable 
fourthplace showings indicating he has broadened his base of 
support 
Gore has singled out Jackson as his main opponent in the South 
I think it will essentially become a twoperson race he said 
He raised the electability of Jackson on Tuesday saying 
Democrats in all parts of the country are really hungry for a 
victory in 1988 and interested in finding a nominee who can offer 
the best chance of beating the Republicans in the fall 
Gore and Jackson are displaying vastly differing campaign 
styles Gore is racking up endorsements from key political leaders 
and kicked off a massive media campaign last week 
Jackson doesnt have the money for big media buys but his 
campaign manager Gerald Austin said that isnt important because 
Jackson is already wellknown 
As for Gores support from the Democratic political 
establishment Austin retorts Were depending on the endorsement 
of the people not the House speakers and the like 
The wellfunded Dukakis was spending heavily in delegaterich 
Florida and Texas and his organization is seen as strong 
especially in Florida 
To mount a serious Super Tuesday television offensive a 
candidate must buy air time in 20 or more separate television 
markets That means big expenses a major factor for candidates 
like Democrats Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon who are saddled 
with debt 
Among Republicans Dole was kicking off his Southern campaign 
with a news conference Thursday at the Georgia Capitol 
Despite Bushs strong Southern organization the best among the 
GOP candidates in the view of some Dole was banking on winning 
over a large undecided vote 
It doesnt surprise me when the people with the vice president 
say theyve got an organization that cant be matched down here 
said Clay Collins Doles campaign director for Georgia 
Nonetheless he said We have the thrust to break through that 
invincibility myth I think we are going to make rapid gains 
Bush however also was confident 
Were going South and fight It looks good there Bush said 
He was to campaign in Missouri on Thursday and in Texas through the 
weekend 
Robertson the former television evangelist has also shown a 
strong Southern organization and his churchbacked following will 
be a formidable force in the Bible belt 
But Robertson also needs to regain momentum after his 
disappointing showing in New Hampshire so hes looking to South 
Carolinas GOP primary on the Saturday before Super Tuesday An 
expected low turnout combined with Robertsons constituency of 
fundamentalist Christian voters make that state a likely spot for 
an improved Robertson performance heading into Super Tuesday
