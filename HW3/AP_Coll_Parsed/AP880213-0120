A grand jury has requested all records linked to 
a mercy killing essay written by a doctor whose identity has 
not been revealed by the Journal of The American Medical 
Association the Chicago SunTimes said Saturday 
The newspaper in its early Sunday editions said the grand jury 
wants the cover letter from the author the original manuscript and 
all correspondence between the Journal and the author 
With a subpoena the Cook County grand jury also has requested 
any inhouse memos about the essay and minutes from editorial staff 
meetings concerning the Jan 8 article the SunTimes said citing 
sources it did not name 
But a spokesman for the AMA and the editor of the Journal said 
they had not seen the subpoena I have no information about 
that editor Dr George Lundberg told The Associated Press 
AMA spokesman Tom Toftey said We have not been subpoenaed as 
far as I know and I am quite certain that I would know if we had 
The states attorneys office had no comment spokesman Terry 
Levin said Saturday 
The essay titled Its Over Debbie has sparked debate 
about the ethics of euthanasia Medical experts and prosecutors 
have urged the journal to release the name of the doctor who wrote 
the article 
The essay which AMA officials admit wasnt verfified describes 
how an exhausted gynecology resident gave a fatal injection of 
morphine to a young woman suffering from ovarian cancer 
Some doctors have questioned whether the incident ever took 
place 
States Attorney Richard M Daley became involved in the matter 
because the Journal is published here The essay did not indicate 
where the author lived or where the incident took place 
Lundberg said the states attorneys office had called AMA 
general counsel Kirk Johnson asking him to reveal the name of the 
doctor Johnson refused 
Previously Johnson has said the organization would challenge 
under First Amendment protections any efforts to obtain the name 
of the author of the essay 
The newspaper said Johnson would go to court to fight the 
subpoena He has however stated that the Journal would make the 
name public if confronted with a formal court order
