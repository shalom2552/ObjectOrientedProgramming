The nations labor leaders are making 
like a duck this year in presidential politics calm on the 
surface and paddling furiously underneath to position themselves 
appropriately with whomever emerges as the Democratic nominee 
Delegate slates in the eight states whose filing deadlines have 
expired show Sen Paul Simon of Illinois Massachusetts Gov 
Micahel Dukakis and Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri all sharing 
close to an equal number of union political activists wanting to 
get to the Democratic National Convention on their tickets 
Jesse Jackson is a close fourth outpacing Sen Albert Gore in 
all eight states including Alablama and Georgia which border on 
Gores home turf of Tennessee 
AFLCIO President Lane Kirkland winding up the AFLCIOs annual 
winter meeting today said the 143millionmember labor federation 
is no closer now to making a presidential endorsement than it was a 
year ago when all of the Democratic candidates but Gore and Dukakis 
were here appealing for union support 
The essential criteria is the same at least a twothirds 
consensus he said But Im not going to force it and Im not 
going to invent it 
William Wynn president of the United Food and Commercial 
Workers Union the AFLCIOs third largest with 1 million members 
doubts there will be an endorsement 
We cant change the fact that no individual has emerged as a 
favorite he said Our Iowa locals got together and endorsed 
Dukakis but it wasnt a very strong endorsement I would bet that 
Jesse Jackson got a lot of UFCW votes in Iowa 
The AFLCIOs early endorsement of Walter Mondale in 1984 helped 
save his campaign after he lost the New Hampshire primary that year 
to then Sen Gary Hart of Colorado But it also enabled Mondales 
opponents to tag labor as a special interest and created a 
backlash among many union members 
Exit polls showed only betwen 53 and 57 percent of voters from 
union households pulling the lever for Mondale in the general 
election far short of the twothirds majority support that the 
AFLCIO claimed that its endorsement represented Union leaders 
here are intent on avoiding a repeat of that 
Were damned if we do and damned if we dont said Richard 
Kilroy president of the Transporation Communications Union and 
head of a coalition of 15 rail unions 
A top AFLCIO political official also doubts that the federation 
will make an endorsement before the Democratic Convention in 
Atlanta in July 
While the federations policy this time of encouraging union 
members to become convention delegates for any candidate of their 
choice is bringing more rankandfile workers into the process it 
also is yielding labor fewer delegates he said 
Individual union political chiefs speculate they will eventually 
get a total of between 10 and 15 of Iowas 52 convention seats 
based on how well labor delegate candidates fared in last weeks 
Iowa caucuses But one federation official speaking on the 
condition of anonymity said not a single labor representative won 
a seat in Tuesdays New Hampshire primary 
Kirkland is playing it just right both in 84 and 88 said 
Frank Greer a veteran political consultant who is not working for 
any of the presidential candidates this year 
The idea of Kirkland and George Meany Kirklands predecessor 
was to prevent somebody unacceptable from getting the nomination 
All of these guys are acceptable
