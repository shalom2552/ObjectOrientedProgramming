Rep Jack Kemp said Monday that the 
Republican presidential race will come down to him and Bob Dole 
whose campaign he derided as one of pain sacrifice and bitter 
medicine 
Kemp said onetime GOP frontrunner George Bushs campaign is 
losing ground based in part on his performance in Sunday nights 
Republican debate 
Im saving second place for Kemp the New York congressman 
said at a news conference on the banks of the rushing Merrimack 
River in downtown Manchester I wouldnt be surprised if we 
surprised a lot of people in New Hampshire and surprised a lot of 
the Bush staff 
Kemp criticized Bush and Dole generally believed to be in a 
tight race for first place as well as Pat Robertson who has been 
gaining ground since his surprising finish ahead of Bush in Iowa 
last week 
Kemp said he believes the Republican race ultimately will come 
down to a contest between himself and Dole a pain sacrifice 
and bitter medicine Bob Dole campaign versus a growth hope 
opportunity progressive populist conservative Jack Kemp 
campaign Were going to win the nomination of the Republican 
Party 
Kemp said Bush television ads accusing Dole of having a history 
of raising taxes should be pulled off the air 
It is consumer fraud for George Bush who has gone along with 
every major tax increase of the 1980s to accuse Bob Dole of being 
a tax increaser he said 
George and Bob never saw a tax they didnt hike 
During a Sunday night debate Kemp assailed Bush for saying 
give peace a chance in Afghanistan 
That was the rallying cry of the liberal Democrats in 
Congress to kill aid for freedom fighters in Central America 
Kemp said 
He said peace alone should not be the goal of American foreign 
policy 
Theres peace in Cuba peace in Vietnam and peace in Poland 
but there is no democracy he said 
That facist regime in Managua needs to be replaced with 
democracy and freedom and I was embarrassed that the vice 
president would make that type of statement that sells short the 
cause of democracy and freedom in this hemisphere
