President Reagans 1989 budget would raise 
spending on general science by 20 percent to 131 billion and 
provide for machines to probe the outer space above Earth and the 
inner space of particles on Earth 
The budget boosts spending for science and research programs by 
22 billion and includes startup funds for the superconducting 
super collider in the Department of Energy and the space station in 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
The spending plan also provides money to the National Science 
Foundation to establish 10 to 15 new basic science research centers 
over the next five years 
About 400 million in the budget would go to the Energy 
Department for the start of construction on historys largest pure 
science machine the superconducting super collider This device 
which would include an underground tunnel more than 50 miles long 
would be the worlds most powerful proton collider Its goal is 
fundamental research into the basic nature of particles smaller 
than the atom 
A number of states are competing for the super collider but the 
final decision on the site has not been made 
Energys science budget authority for 1989 would total 12 
billion a 49 percent increase over the 1988 level Most of the 
increase would go to the collider 
At a briefing on the NASA budget space agency Administrator 
James Fletcher said the presidents budget follows a policy that 
clearly commits the United States to space leadership as a 
fundamental objective and establishes for the first time a 
longrange goal of putting astronauts on other planets 
NASAs budget outlay would increase by nearly 30 percent from 
84 billion in 1988 to 101 billion in 1989 
Almost 1 billion of the outlay would go for startup 
construction of the space station a permanent orbital base that 
NASA plans to have in operation in the mid1990s Space agency 
officials had hoped for another 800 million but the project has 
been resisted by some in Congress 
The space budget also includes startup funds for the Pathfinder 
Project a research program designed to develop the basic 
technologies needed to send astronauts to Mars sometime in the next 
century 
NASA also would receive more than 1 billion additional in its 
space flight budget in 1989 This will cover the additional costs 
of space shuttle missions The agency hopes to complete recovery 
from the 1986 Challenger accident with the resumption of shuttle 
flights in August and a gradual increase in mission rate in 1989 
The funding also covers the cost of building a new shuttle 
spacecraft expected to be completed now in 1991 
The National Science Foundation outlay would increase from 167 
billion in 1988 to 181 billion in 1989 
Reagan called for a 300 million increase in basic research 
funded by the foundation The budget proposes to establish 10 to 15 
basic science research centers over the next five years These 
centers would focus on research among a number of scientific 
disciplines and encourage industry participation the 
administration said
