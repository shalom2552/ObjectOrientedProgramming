Gov Evan Mechams right to a fair trial 
in criminal court will be severely harmed if his impeachment trial 
starts Monday as scheduled his lawyer told the Arizona Senate 
Mecham attorney Murray Miller said Tuesday that conducting the 
impeachment trial first would subject the criminal trial to 
prejudicial publicity 
In my judgment he will be convicted in the criminal trial if 
this matter the impeachment trial is going to proceed and he is 
convicted here Miller said It just is in the cards and I 
fear for his liberty 
The Senate was expected to decide late today whether to delay 
the impeachment trial Senate President Carl Kunasek a Republican 
said he expected the Senate to approve some type of delay but he 
would not predict how long it would be 
Miller said that if the Senate decides to go ahead with the 
trial next week he will ask a court to halt it However some 
senators have questioned whether the courts have the authority to 
order the Legislature to delay an impeachment trial 
The Senate also decided to wait until today to reconsider a 
policy that allows all 30 senators to meet in closed conference 
during the impeachment trial 
The House approved 23 articles of impeachment against the 
Republican governor Feb 5 accusing him of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund 
and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by 
a state official 
Mecham is scheduled to stand trial March 9 on six felony charges 
contained in an indictment that accuse him of fraud perjury and 
filing false documents in connection with the 350000 loan He 
also faces a March 17 recall election 
Miller said the Senate trial should be delayed until after the 
criminal trial or at least delayed 90 days to give him more time 
to prepare his case 
The House impeachment board of managers which is overseeing the 
prosecution in the Senate trial said in a written response that 
the Arizona Constitution does not require the Senate to await the 
outcome of Mechams criminal trial 
The fivemember House board said a delay would leave the state 
government in limbo Mecham has asked Secretary of State Rose 
Mofford who is acting governor not to accept resignations from 
his staff and not to approve any tax increases which he opposes 
House counsel William French said the criminal trial would not 
be over until mid to late May at the earliest I think thats 
too long for the state of Arizona to remain in a flux he said 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane a Republican said he had 
examined the records of other impeachment trials and did not find 
that they had been delayed until after related criminal trials 
The Senate met briefly Tuesday in a closed session to discuss 
whether it should change its rule on closed conferences during the 
trial The conferences would be intended to let senators meet with 
their lawyers discuss possible questions to be asked and possibly 
to hold final deliberations 
The policy has been criticized by the media and 11 senators 
boycotted Tuesdays closed meeting
