Democrat Richard Gephardt on Sunday dismissed 
as balderdash rivals charges he was a supporter of President 
Reagans tax and economics program 
Two days before the New Hampshire primary the Missouri 
congressmen paused for a Valentines Day lobsterandchowder lunch 
with his wife Jane at a bayside seafood house then greeted 
hundreds of shoppers at a nearby mall 
But as he met lunchtime diners he was confronted by one mans 
question about his changes of position and he defended himself 
anew against similar charges as he spoke to reporters 
Paul Simons charged in the Democrats televised debate Saturday 
night that Gephardt had changed positions to suit the electorate he 
next faced talking against Reaganomics in Iowa and in favor 
of it in this traditionally antitax state 
Thats just balderdash he said I have been the leader 
against Reaganomics in the House he said 
Gephardt defended his vote for Reagans 1981 taxcut bill as 
cast only after the Democrats alternative was defeated and 
saying he differed with his rivals on the need for lowering taxes 
on middleincome people 
Once we lost the question was clear were we for a tax cut 
for the middle class or were we not Gephardt said 
When we get to the South and the general election we cant be 
the party of higher taxes on the middle class Gephardt said 
Gephardt focused mainly on taxes and lashed back at Simon 
saying Senator Simons record is clear hes resisted every 
measure to reduce the taxes on individual American families thats 
come along 
Gephardt who edged Simon in last weeks Iowa caucuses is 
locked in what could be a political deathstruggle with Simon for 
second place behind Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis in New 
Hampshires Tuesday primary Heavily in debt Gephardts campaign 
badly needs to finish no lower than second 
He has been under attack from Simons television commercials and 
from the public comments of most of his rivals who say Gephardt 
has flipflopped on issues 
Speaking to reporters Gephardt maintained anew that Simons 
aids and rhetoric falsely accused me 
Gephardt denounced Simons lonely vote against the 1986 tax 
overhaul bill reflected total ignorance of what the bill was 
about Gephardt also sought to lump Dukakis with Simon on taxes 
saying He doesnt want to tell you what hes for on taxes 
As he worked his way through the 300 or so people at Newicks 
Lobster House overlooking Great Bay Gephardt ran into a questioner 
who wanted to know why he had changed his position to oppose the MX 
missile 
I watched the debate last night I thought theyd kind of 
nailed him on that said the man Jack Overall of Los Angeles 
Calif who said he came to visit friends in New Hampshire this 
week to watch the presidential campaigners 
Overall said Gephardt stopped and told him hed changed 
positions in an effort to reach a bipartisan position in the 
Congress that would be supportive of arms control negotiations 
I accept that Overall said 
Gephardts appearance didnt create much of a stir except for 
the disorder caused by the news media crush at the restaurant It 
is a traditional stop for New Hampshire presidential campaigners 
Its a little slow were ususally full for lunch said 
waitress Susan Miltner Were not making any money either
