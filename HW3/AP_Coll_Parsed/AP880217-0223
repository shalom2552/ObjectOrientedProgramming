Two men sentenced to a total of 735 years 
in prison for the kidnapping and sexual molestation of two children 
asked Wednesday that their convictions be overturned 
Alex Carbarga 23 and Luis Tree Frog Johnson 38 were 
convicted of a string of crimes that began when they snatched 
2yearold Tara Burke from a shopping center in Concord 30 miles 
east of San Francisco in February 1982 
It ended 10 months later when police broke into a dingy bread 
van parked under a San Francisco freeway overpass and discovered 
Tara huddled inside The other child in the case 11yearold Mac 
Lin had fled and alerted police 
During trial Carbarga who was 18 when arrested was depicted 
by his attorney as Johnsons youthful pawn and sex slave since 
Carbargas parents turned their 9yearold son over to Johnson 
Carbarga pleaded innocent because of insanity 
His attorney Alan Caplan argued before the threemember panel 
of the state Court of Appeals that Superior Court Judge Robert 
Dossee allowed testimony about Carbargas tragic mental 
condition in the penalty phase of the trial but incorrectly 
prohibited it during the guilt phase 
It was really the only defense and the jury didnt know it 
he said 
Carbarga was convicted on 93 of the 154 counts against him Of 
the convictions 89 were felonies Jurors found he was not legally 
sane at the time of 58 crimes and he was sentenced to 208 years on 
35 offenses 
A central issue is prosecution classification of some crimes as 
taking place before a change in California law that altered 
standards to determine questions such as whether a defendant knew 
the difference in right and wrong could form the required mental 
intent to commit certain crimes or could appreciate their nature 
Caplan said there was a twoyear window between enactment of 
one law regarding sanity determination and a state Supreme Court 
ruling that the law had incorrectly stated legislative intent 
Theres no way in hell this boy could have formed the intent 
required to commit these crimes he said of Carbarga 
Deputy Attorney General Robert Murphy said certain technical 
problems had to be worked out at trial and have to be worked out on 
appeal 
According to Caplan the appeals court could take a variety of 
actions Carbarga could be tried again on the criminal offenses or 
the sanity question he could go to a mental hospital or be 
returned to Juvenile Court and sent to the California Youth 
Authority 
Johnsons attorney George Schraer argued for reversal of his 
clients convictions saying blacks were unfairly excluded during 
jury selection Johnson is black 
Schraer also said police acted without a search warrant when 
they broke into the van 
In addition he said the defense was not alowed to show 
potential jurors some of the videotapes and photographs seized and 
depicting Tara and Mac nude often in sexual situations 
By only describing the material he argued the defense couldnt 
reliably gauge response when potential jurors said they could 
consider the case fairly despite the evidence 
Johnson convicted of 95 felonies and five misdemeanors is 
serving a 527year term
