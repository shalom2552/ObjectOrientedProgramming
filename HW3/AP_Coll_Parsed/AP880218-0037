Democrat Richard Gephardt temporarily 
putting aside the Super Tuesday primaries of the South less than 
three weeks away says he is hoping to pick up a victory sooner in 
the smallerdelegate states of South Dakota and Wyoming 
After stressing opposition to higher taxes in New Hampshire for 
the past week Gephardt returned Wednesday to the familiar theme of 
attacking what he said were unfair trade practices by Japan and 
other countries as he campaigned in South Dakota and Wyoming 
They take our technology and make a like product and bring it 
to the United States and put our workers out of work Gephardt 
said after touring an electronics assembly plant in Rapid City SD 
This administration has been asleep at the switch on trade 
Gephardt said 
Gephardt flew on to Casper for an evening rally with Wyoming 
supporters before flying back to South Dakota which he will have 
visited on six of the seven days leading up to next Tuesdays 
primary in that state 
While his chief rivals were fanning out across the South in 
advance of the pivotal March 8 primaries throughout the region 
Gephardt was gambling that he could score a win in South Dakota 
next week and on March 5 in Wyomings caucuses that would send him 
into Super Tuesday with the aura of a recent winner 
I think I can do well here said Gephardt who won Iowas 
caucuses 10 days ago and finished a distant second in New Hampires 
leadoff primary In order to do that I have to get my message 
across and see people 
Gephardt strategists said they decided not to compete in three 
other states holding contests during the next three weeks Vermont 
and Maine where Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis figures to be 
strong and Minnesota where Dukakis and Illinois Sen Paul Simon 
are contesting 
Gephardt has purchased 40000 worth of television commercials 
in South Dakota a significant amount in the state of just 700000 
people Gore and Dukakis are already on the air here 
Moreover a victory in South Dakota would be just for show Its 
primary is a beauty contest in which voters will state a 
preference but no delegates will be awarded with the votes 
Gephardts strategists contend they can campaign in South Dakota 
and Wyoming and still attract attention in the process in the 
Southern states where huge numbers of delegates are at stake 
More than onethird of the Democratic nominating delegates are 
up for grabs on that day with primaries in 20 states including 
every state of the South save South Carolina 
Gephardt was joining the other Democratic candidates in Dallas 
for their debate this evening and also planned trips into Arkansas 
and Oklahoma while returning to South Dakota nearly every day for a 
week and to Wyoming three days 
At the Rapid City plant of Anderson Scientific which 
manufactuers satellite receivers for home television viewing 
president Joe Massa told Gephardt the company had been forced to 
lay off nearly its entire work force of 150 people and seen its 
gross revenues decline from 45 million to less than 1 million in 
three years 
He accused Japanese competitors of stealing patented technology 
and dumping their products at a loss to gain US sales 
With TV cameras rolling Gephardt toured the factory to 
underscore his call for tough trade sanctions against unfair 
foreign competitors and he pointed to the company as an example of 
imports coming into the United States while Asian markets are 
largely closed to US goods 
Massa acknowledged however that the companys troubles were 
also due in part to a decline in the home satellite TV business 
because some major satellite broadcasters have scrambled their 
signals to prevent home viewers from watching without paying 
Founder Keith Anderson told Gephardt he supports the Missouri 
congressmans trade sanctions legislation and said his company 
might fail unless you pass your trade bill and we can have a 200 
percent duty put on
