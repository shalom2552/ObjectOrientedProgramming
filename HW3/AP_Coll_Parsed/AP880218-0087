Here is the text of President Reagans budget 
message to Congress 
To the Congress of the United States 
As we consider the state of our nation today we have much cause 
for satisfaction 
Thanks to sound policies steadfastly pursued during the past 
seven years America is at peace and our people are enjoying the 
longest peacetime economic expansion in our nations history 
By reordering priorities so that we spend more on national 
security and less on wasteful or unnecessary federal programs we 
have made freedom more secure around the world and have been able 
to negotiate with our adversaries from a position of strength 
By pursuing marketoriented economic policies we have uncorked 
the genie of American enterprise and created new businesses more 
jobs improved production and widespread prosperity 
And we have done all this without neglecting the poor the 
elderly the infirm and the unfortunate among us

Let me note a few of the highlights from our administrations 
record of accomplishment 
The current expansion now in its 63rd month has outlasted all 
previous peacetime expansions in US history Business investment 
and exports are rising in real terms foreshadowing continued 
economic growth this year and next 
Since this expansion began 15 million new jobs have been 
created while the unemployment rate has fallen by 5 percentage 
points to 57 percent the lowest level in nearly a decade By 
comparison employment in other developed countries has not grown 
significantly and their unemployment rates have remained high 
Inflation which averaged 104 percent annually during the four 
years before I came to office has averaged less than a third of 
that during the past five years 
The prime interest rate was 215 percent just before I came 
into office it is now 85 percent the mortgage rate which was 
149 percent is now down to 102 percent 
Since 1981 the amount of time spent by the public filling out 
forms required by the federal government has been cut by hundreds 
of millions of hours annually and the number of pages of 
regulations published annually in the Federal Register has been 
reduced by over 45 percent 
Between 1981 and 1987 changes in the federal tax code 
including a complete overhaul in 1986 have made the tax laws more 
equitable significantly lowered earned income tax rates for many 
individuals and corporations and eliminated the need for 43 
million lowincome individuals or families to file tax forms 
At the same time real aftertax personal income has risen 15 
percent during the past five years increasing our overall standard 
of living
