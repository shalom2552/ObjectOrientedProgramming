A legal victory in a custody fight over the 
bodies of two street people who froze to death will enable an 
advocacy group for the homeless to hold a public funeral and 
24hour protest vigil near city hall 
The US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
on Friday upheld a lower court which reversed a city official who 
called the funeral plan an attempt by homeless advocate Mitch 
Snyder to create a public spectacle 
The threejudge appeals panel upheld US District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson who earlier in the day ordered the District of 
Columbia to release the bodies to the Community for Creative 
NonViolence which operates a shelter for the homeless There was 
no immediate information on when the funeral would take place 
Our purpose in holding the funeral is not to point the finger 
at the DC government Snyder said We are all responsible 
for the plight of the homeless 
During the emergency hearing attorney Mark Venuti said the 
organization for eight years has been claiming the bodies of all 
homeless people who die of exposure 
DC attorney Lutz Prager said the group wanted to use the 
bodies for a public spectacle to embarrass the city government 
for not doing enough for homeless people 
The District of Columbia has an interest in not having a 
public display of dead bodies Prager said 
At the earlier proceeding in US District Court Jackson told 
city attorneys he had a great deal of difficulty understanding 
how this differs from innumerable presidential funeral corteges 
that have proceeded up Pennsylvania Avenue since the beginning of 
the country 
Noting that the remains would be in closed caskets Jackson said 
he saw no legitimate governmental interest in preventing the 
homeless advocates from holding a dignified funeral in a public 
plaza across Pennsylvania Avenue from the District of Columbia 
Building 
City officials said they had been unable to find next of kin for 
Henry Dixon who died Jan 2 in a parking attendants booth and an 
undentified woman who was found dead five days later in a 
construction site 
So far 10 homeless people have died on the streets of the 
nations capital this winter
