As the presidential candidates head South from 
Iowa and New Hampshire Southern political leaders are predicting 
that Super Tuesday will broaden the presidential debate into a 
discussion of issues of national concern 
To help focus that debate the Sunbelt Institute and the 
Congressional Sunbelt Caucus released a report Wednesday outlining 
a series of issues important both in the South and in the nation as 
a whole 
The report urges the presidential candidates for example to 
explain how they would combat illegal drugs eradicate illiteracy 
promote energy independence in the face of rising oil imports 
reform the welfare system and develop impoverished rural areas 
Former Virginia Gov Chuck Robb told a news conference that 
Super Tuesday will shift the campaign from retail to wholesale 
politics by forcing the candidates to address such national 
issues rather than the more narrow agenda of New Hampshire and Iowa 
voters 
A total of 20 states 14 of them in the South will hold 
primaries or caucuses on Super Tuesday March 8 The 20 states will 
select 282 percent of the delegates to the Democratic National 
Convention and 303 percent of the delegates to the Republican 
National Convention

Rep Jack Kemps presidential campaign is 
reacting with amusement to the suggestion by Sen Alfonse DAmato 
RNY that Kemp consider running against Sen Daniel P Moynihan 
DNY when and if he drops out of the race for the nations 
top job 
Really Kemp spokeswoman Mary Brunette laughed Wednesday 
when told of DAmatos brainstorm Well thats interesting 
Then more soberly Congressman Kemp has absolutely no 
intention of quitting the presidential race Were in it to the 
end 
She said the campaign was gaining momentum and I think its 
kind of absurd for Sen DAmato to make that suggestion although 
we appreciate his support 
DAmato said he wasnt suggesting that Kemp quit only that if 
he did he could win in New York which he has served from the 
House since 1970
