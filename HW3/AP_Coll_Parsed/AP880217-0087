Augsburg College officials have changed their 
minds about naming part of a new building after a major donor 
because they learned he had mailed thousands of hostile letters to 
interracial families 
The college will however keep the 500000 Elroy Stock donated 
last year as well as other contributions made over 20 years 
The positions and actions of Mr Elroy Stock as reported in 
the media have disturbed angered and saddened hundreds of 
individuals and families including members of the Augsburg 
community college President Charles Anderson said Tuesday after 
a regents committee meeting 
For some persons to have the name of Mr Stock on a wing of 
our new building would be misunderstood to mean the college agrees 
with his stance Anderson said 
Anderson who is white and has a black daughterinlaw said he 
received three anonymous letters himself from Stock 
Stock a 65yearold retired executive of West Publishing Co 
who lives in Woodbury gave the Lutheren college 500000 for a new 
worship drama and communication building It was the largest 
single gift last year to the college which has 2100 students 
Mr Stocks way of acquiring the funds is through honest 
work Anderson said Whatever Mr Stock has done he has had an 
opportunity to use his means to do some good for a lot of people I 
see no reason why he should be denied that opportunity 
Stock a 1949 Augsburg graduate told WCCOTV on Tuesday that he 
was disappointed by the decision not to name the building wing 
after him 
Its all over he said I dont want to even think about 
it If they want to take it off Im not going to care 
WCCOTV reported last week that Stock had been sending unsigned 
letters to interracial couples for 14 years The station said the 
letters included such comments as A dog breeder would not think 
of producing mongrel dogs so why should the human race be 
mongrel 
Anderson said he was convinced after meeting with Stock over the 
weekend that Stock is sorry he hurt people with the mailings 
After a fiveyear investigation postal officials linked the 
letters to Stock in early 1987 said Sterling McKusick a retired 
US Postal Service inspector McKusick had received about 1000 
complaints the earliest dating to about 1982 
But Stock could not be prosecuted because he had not broken any 
laws Complaints ceased shortly after Stock was confronted by 
authorities in March 1987 McKusick said 
Anderson said no one at the college was aware of the situation 
until school officials were contacted by WCCO
