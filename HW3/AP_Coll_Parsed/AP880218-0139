The death rate from strokes is falling about 6 
percent annually but the disease will still cost Americans nearly 
13 billion this year according to a medical report released 
Thursday 
Despite its declining mortality rate stroke remains the 
thirdleading cause of death in the United States after heart 
disease and cancer 
A report released by the American Heart Association showed that 
stroke also continues to be a major financial burden 
This year the association estimates that 92 billion will be 
spent on hospital and nursing home care alone for stroke victims 
who are often left paralyzed by their disease When doctor and 
nurse bills medicine and lost productivity are added the total 
annual cost of strokes in 1988 will be an estimated 129 billion 
In 1985 the last year for which statistics are available about 
500000 Americans suffered strokes 152700 of them died About a 
third of all survivors need help caring for themselves 
Not all the statistics are bad however The decline in the 
stroke death rate has been picking up speed in recent years 
The death rate is falling very dramatically said Dr Philip 
A Wolf of Boston University Medical School 
For the past four decades the death rate from stroke has been 
dropping at a rate of about 1 percent a year But since 1973 that 
decline has averaged 57 percent a year 
No one knows precisely why this cause of death is becoming less 
common However the risk of heart attacks is also going down and 
many experts believe the same factors are involved in curbing both 
diseases 
A lot of people think the control of blood pressure changes 
in lifestyles changes in diet more exercise and more health 
consciousness are affecting vascular blood vessel disease in 
general said Dr Louis R Caplan of Tufts Medical School in 
Boston and chairman of the heart associations stroke council 
Wolf who is also an epidemiologist at the longrunning 
Framingham Heart Study said that control of blood pressure appears 
to be the single most important of these factors 
He noted that when even mildly elevated blood pressure is 
brought down through drugs and behavior changes peoples risk of 
stroke is cut in half 
A stroke occurs when the blood supply in the brain is disrupted 
Often a blood clot chokes off an artery starving brain cells of 
oxygen Strokes also occur when blood vessels burst and flood brain 
tissue with blood 
Traditionally doctors have been able to do little for patients 
except send them to hospitals where they are taught to live with 
their disabilities However that is beginning to change Caplan 
said 
A lot of us are hoping that new technology used in patients 
who are diagnosed correctly may do a lot to help patients get 
better he said in an interview 
Caplan said that new diagnostic machines are becoming available 
that can help doctors pinpoint precisely where inside the head the 
blood vessels are in danger of clogging or breaking Strokes may 
then be prevented with surgery or treatment 
Doctors also are experimenting with drugs that may minimize the 
damage of strokes once they occur 
Most people have treated stroke casually said Caplan 
They say theres nothing you can do but rehabilitate the patient 
The excitement is that we are starting to have the technology and 
ability to do something 
However he said that most of the new tools and expertise are 
now available only at large medical centers He recommended that 
stroke patients be sent to the big hospitals for diagnosis
