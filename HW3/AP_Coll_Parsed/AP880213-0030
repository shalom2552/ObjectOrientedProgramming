The 12nation European Economic 
Community today ended months of financial crisis approving an 
agricultural reform package that for the first time limits farm 
spending 
The deal to control although not end the Communitys 
burgeoning agricultural surpluses was reached in the early hours 
averting virtual bankruptcy for the trade bloc later this year 
I think it was better to try to strain for agreement today 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain looking tired told 
reporters Her country had made major concessions 
The emergency summit which began Thursday was the third 
highlevel attempt in eight months to solve the Communitys 
financial woes The EEC had operated without a budget since 
December 
Mrs Thatcher long isolated by her European partners over 
finances dropped major demands for austerity in the face of 
persistent opposition headed by France 
The summit was marked by particularly angry clashes between Mrs 
Thatcher and French Premier Jacques Chirac 
Mrs Thatcher termed absolutely crazy French insistence that 
production quotas on cheaper commodities be referred to a foreign 
ministers meeting instead of agreed upon at the summit in an 
acrosstheboard deal 
Britain and the Netherlands endorsed the package which dealt 
with the most expensive crops on condition the foreign ministers 
approve curbs on the lesser commodities which was virtually 
certain 
It was the first time in the EECs 31year history that leaders 
fixed a limit to farm spending which eats up twothirds of the 
EECs annucal budget 
The agreement set a 344 billion limit on farm spending in 
1988 slightly higher than last year This can rise by no more than 
25 billion over five years Mrs Thatcher had wanted a 338 
billion limit for 1988 and a smaller increase in the years ahead 
West Germany the EEC chairman and France had wanted a 369 
billion limit 
Also the leaders agreed to limit grain production to 160 
million metric tons a year compared with 155 million tons demanded 
by Britain and the Netherlands 
Mrs Thatcher said her concession was partly offset by a 9 
percent automatic price cut over three years for grain production 
that exceeds the ceiling 
The agreement also set strict production quotas on oilseeds 
closer to British demands 
The EEC leaders agreed to raise by 80 percent over the next five 
years regional aid to Spain Portugal Greece and Ireland the 
poorest members Spain had sought a 100 percent rise compared with 
a 50 percent rise favored by the rich northern states including 
Britain France and West Germany 
The increase will bring regional aid to 1625 billion by 1992 
In addition to reducing expenditures the summit agreed to tap 
new revenues by basing membership dues on the relative wealth of 
member states rather than sales taxes only Italy with a large 
economy which isnt reflected in sales tax returns would have to 
pay more 
The agreement was widely seen as sending a signal to the United 
States to rein in its agricultural production 
I hope fervently that our friends across the ocean do 
their share to control their agricultural spending said Dutch 
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers
