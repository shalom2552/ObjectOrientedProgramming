A boom startled the sentries 
shattered the tropical predawn calm and cut off all the lights at 
the Salvadoran Cotton Cooperative Ltd outside this provincial 
capital 
The attack was part of the biggest guerrilla offensive this 
year The coordinated strike included a raid on the 6th Infantry 
Brigade base in Usulutan 5 miles east of the cooperative and the 
blowing up of two bridges and more than a dozen utility poles 
In San Salvador about 60 miles to the northwest foreign 
ministers of five Central American nations met to assess progress 
in implementing a regional peace accord signed last August 
Army officers said the attacks early Wednesday by 600 insurgents 
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front left at least 18 
people dead Fourteen people were wounded 
An entire family the five young Hernandez children and their 
parents perished when a guerrilla mortar fell short of the 6th 
Brigade compound and hit their oneroom brick and adobe home in a 
poor neighborhood 
Five soldiers of the brigade died as did at least five 
guerrillas said the brigade commander Col Inocencio Montano He 
said about 300 rebels took part in the strike on the base 
Montano said four of the 55 US military advisers stationed in 
El Salvador were at the base when the assault began at 1210 am 
but none was in danger 
Pvt Rodolfo Marinero Montoya slouched on the steps of the 
cooperatives makeshift barracks exhausted after many hours of 
combat 
After the mortar barrage he said the guerrillas attacked 
from all sides He said a mortar round scored a direct hit on one 
of the opensided zincroofed warehouses behind the barracks 
igniting stacked bales of cottonseed 
Marinero said he did not know if the other warehouses caught 
fire from the heat of the first blaze or if the dozens of rebels 
that penetrated the cooperative burned them 
Seven of the 15 warehouses were destroyed Members and officials 
of the cooperative did not have a dollar estimate of the damage A 
cottonseed oil factory next to the cooperative also was attacked 
and damaged 
By midday tired firefighters with sootstreaked faces took 
turns training a stream of water on the only warehouse fire that 
still threatened to spread 
Rebels fighting an 8yearold war against the USsupported 
government contend economic targets especially farms or storage 
facilities for coffee cotton and sugar are valid military 
objectives 
The three products account for 80 percent of El Salvadors 
foreign exchange 
Lt Jose Mejia Henriquez commander of the cooperatives 
permanent 30man police detachment said the attackers numbered 
about 300 
The guerrillas demolished a utility pole down the road from the 
big communal enterprise then fired 60mm mortars and 
rocketpropelled grenades for about 15 minutes 
Then they attacked shouting like Indians Mejia said on the 
porch of the cooperatives offices They shouted at us to 
surrender calling to me by my name that it was useless to resist 
His troops held the guerrillas off at the front of the 
cooperative he said but many rebels breached the defenses from 
the sides and rear and infiltrated the cooperative Julio Campos of 
the National Police was killed 
The rebels blew up the Palo Seco and Vado Marine bridges just 
west and east respectively of Usulutan The city 70 miles 
southeast of San Salvador and home to 70000 people is the capital 
of Usulutan province on this countrys hot scrub and palmstudded 
coastal plain 
Mejia said the battle at the cooperative lasted nearly four 
hours about an hour longer than fighting around the 6th Brigade 
He said he could not say categorically that the attackers 
suffered losses but said reinforcements that arrived after dawn 
found at least two places around the cooperative with pools of 
blood and firstaid refuse that indicated casualties 
The foreign ministers of El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua 
Guatemala and Costa Rica ended 10 hours of talks Wednesday in San 
Salvador without agreeing on the mechanisms for determining 
compliance with provisions of the regional peace plan 
They said they would meet again next month in Guatemala 
Salvadoran Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo Peralta opened the 
session by urging the signatories to comply with the peace plans 
injunction against providing aid to insurgents in any Central 
American country The call was apparently directed at Nicaragua 
which El Salvador claims backs the FMLN 
El Salvador a Massachusettssized country of 5 million people 
last year received more than 600 million in US aid most of it 
military or warrelated
