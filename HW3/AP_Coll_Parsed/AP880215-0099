Minority demonstrators occupying a 
building to protest campus racism sent a sympathy card to the 
universitys chancellor today after learning that his brother was 
ill and the chancellor responded with a basket of fruit 
Roscoe Robinson a spokesman for the group occupying New Africa 
Hall also said the group had revised the language of its demands 
to make them more acceptable to the administration However he 
said the thrust of the demands remains unchanged 
He refused to say anything further and said he wanted to give 
UMass Chancellor Joseph Duffey a chance to review them 
An estimated 125 demonstrators have held the fourstory brick 
building on the UMass campus since Friday to protest an alleged 
beating of two black students by whites Feb 7 and other recent 
racial incidents at the school Their demands include the 
suspension of five white students allegedly involved in the beating 
Protesters are to meet with Duffey on Tuesday Robinson said 
Duffey said he was unable to meet with them today because he had to 
visit his hospitalized brother No further information about the 
brother was available 
The protesters this morning sent Duffey a card expressing 
sympathy and wishing Duffeys brother a speedy recovery Duffey 
responded by sending the protesters a fruit basket 
I send affection and respect a card attached to the basket

With classes scheduled to resume Tuesday at the building an 
AfroAmerican studies center Duffey is trying to avoid a 
confrontation said university spokesman James Langley The 
students say they wont leave until Duffey meets their demands 
Were being as patient as we possibly can Langley said I 
dont think youll see any arrests They are being very peaceful 
The black Hispanic American Indian and Asian students who took 
over the New Africa Hall said Sunday a church had pledged money and 
restaurants had donated hot meals for the protesters 
We havent even had to leave the building to buy food said 
Rio Gabriel 21 a junior from Toronto 
Other demonstrators left briefly for showers and breakfast at 
home Ms Gabriel said The campus has been shut down since 
Saturday for the holiday weekend 
She said the leaders of the group talked with black 
administrators Sunday in preparation for a meeting with the 
chancellor on their demands which have been increased to include 
more financing for minority activities and increased hiring of 
minority faculty 
Duffey acknowledged over the weekend that racism continues to be 
a problem at the school 
I think weve got a continuing problem with harassment and 
abuse although it is not just racial he told reporters 
Last year the university disciplined six white students who 
pleaded no contest to charges stemming from a racial clash in which 
a black student was chased and beaten after the final 1986 World 
Series game between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets 
A report issued afterward by the Civility Commission a group of 
faculty and staff members that reviews campus confrontations 
called for hiring more minority faculty and administrators and 
urged antiracism education for administrators among other 
recommendations 
The report cited the investigation into the racial clash by 
Frederick Hurst the head of the state Commission Against Racism 
who had criticized the administrations historical denial of 
racial problems on campus 
According to the school 41 of its 1339 faculty members and 5 
percent of the 20000 undergraduates are black mirroring a 
nationwide decline in the number of black applicants in the last 
several years
