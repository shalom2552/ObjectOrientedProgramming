Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis said 
Friday theres a difference between talking about things and 
doing things a dig at the long legislative careers of his 
Democratic presidential rivals 
Trudging through a snowstorm that stalled New Hampshire Dukakis 
suggested that his chief Democratic opponents make speeches and 
promises while he as a governor takes action 
Dukakis said he is fit to lead because Ive done it Because 
Ive demonstrated I can do it These just arent promises these 
just arent speeches 
Theres a difference between talking about things and doing 
things Dukakis said in a snowy campaign stop at Manchesters 
fire department 
Dukakis finished third in Mondays Iowa caucus behind Missouri 
Rep Richard Gephardt and Illinois Sen Paul Simon both of whom 
have long legislative careers 
Polls leading up to Tuesdays firstinthenation New Hampshire 
primary show Dukakis in first place riding his regional advantage 
with Gephardt and Simon trailing 
The governors remarks echoed the recent Republican campaign 
tack of Vice President George Bush who has been contrasting his 
executive experience with Bob Doles congressional career 
Dukakis criticized Gephardt for failing to get his legislative 
agenda through Congress Dukakis said a Gephardt proposal to impose 
trade reprisals against countries that bar imports from the United 
States is stalled 
His amendment is dead Its been killed in a Democratic 
Senate which apparently he doesnt understand Dukakis said 
The governor opposes trade barriers saying they would only 
encourage other countries to follow suit 
We arent going to compete strongly and effectively in this 
world by putting walls Dukakis said Were not going to do it 
by hunkering down and going back to old ideas and old solutions 
that have been tried and failed
