A majority of Mexicos creditor banks have 
given the government permission to go ahead with a new proposal to 
swap some of its enormous foreign debt for special bonds the 
Treasury Department said 
At the same time it announced that the first auction of the 
bonds had been tentatively set for Feb 26 a week later than 
initially planned 
In New York JP Morgan amp Co the exchange agent of the deal 
said in a statement Thursday that the deadline was extended by a 
week in response to requests from numerous banks to prepare their 
bids 
Under the program the government plans to exchange some of the 
debt it owes foreign commercial bankers for new 20year bonds that 
will be issued by the government 
The Mexican bonds will be backed by 10 billion worth of special 
securities to be issued early this year by the US government 
Mexico is expected to pay about 2 billion for the 20year US 
zero coupon bonds which pay no interest but are issued at a sharp 
discount of their face value 
In a statement released late Wednesday the Mexican Treasury 
Department said it asked its approximately 600 creditor banks 
permission to offer the bonds because provisions in the loan 
contracts bar it from giving preferences in the repayment of the 
debts 
It received majority approval on Feb 5 it said 
Even so it said the fact that the banks have expressed 
agreement so that the bonds can be issued does not imply a 
commitment on their part to take part in the auction 
Jose Angel Gurria the nations chief debt negotiator said 300 
banks had given their authorization for Mexico to go ahead with the 
auction 
The program would apply to 51 billion of the countrys total 
foreign debt of about 105 billion the second highest in the 
developing world after Brazil 
Some major US banks reportedly plan to shun the auction 
because they are unhappy that Mexico will continue obtaining loans 
at 100 percent of their value while paying back through the bond 
program its old loans at about half their value 
They also are reluctant to accept losses of 50 percent or so on 
the loans entered into years ago 
Gurria in an interview with the government newspaper El 
Nacional shrugged off the banks concerns 
It doesnt worry us he said The banks should make 
their decision and quote it No one pressures them nor suggests a 
price to them 
We are not negotiating he said they are taking their 
position and they will declare it in a sealed envelope 
When government officials open the bids he said those that 
please us most we take and those that dont no The auction 
mechanism eliminates negotiations 
He said the government has no preconceived idea about prices 
or levels We have a totally open mind because we are entering 
new ground Nothing will happen if the offers in the auction are 
not accepted 
Government officials have said previously that if they dont 
consider the bids good enough they may well not accept any 
Under the program banks would exchange their old debt for the 
new bonds letting Mexico recover 52 cents or so for each dollar in 
the secondary market That means that Mexico could retire part of 
its debt for half its face value 
By reducing its debt the government will also cut the amount of 
interest it pays each year on the loans Mexico was scheduled to 
pay an estimated 8 billion to 9 billion in interest charges in 
1987
