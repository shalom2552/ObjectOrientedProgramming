The New Hampshire primary could be the last 
hurrah for several presidential candidates who have suggested 
radical changes in Social Security ranging from letting young 
workers opt out of the system to taxing all of affluent retirees 
benefits 
But even if the candidates who stumped for those ideas are gone 
Social Security will remain a hot issue in this presidential race 
just as it was in 1984 and in the last three congressional 
elections 
The likelihood is that it will also be a provocative topic in 
1992 and every four years after that for the foreseeable future 
Too many Americans have too much at stake in Social Security for it 
to be otherwise 
This issue may be with us for the rest of our lives said 
Paul Maslin pollster for Democratic candidate Paul Simon 
In the Iowa caucuses the candidates most closely associated 
with calls for changes in Social Security Republican Pete du Pont 
and Democrat Bruce Babbitt took a shellacking 
Republican Pat Robertson who like du Pont favors privatizing 
some of Social Security finished a strong second but it was his 
stand on moral issues not pensions that galvanized his Iowa 
supporters 
Du Pont who contends the system will crash in the next century 
under the weight of the retired baby boomers unless they are 
allowed to save their own retirement funds finished a distant 
fifth 
Rep Jack Kemp of New York the Republicans most vigorous 
defender of the status quo in Social Security was fourth but 
hoping to move up in New Hampshire with his unbridled attacks on 
Sen Bob Dole and Vice President George Bush for supporting a 
freeze on Social Security in 1985 
Dole on the other hand is telling voters everywhere he goes 
about his role on the National Commission on Social Security Reform 
in 1983 when the Kansas senator helped hammer out a lastminute 
compromise that put Social Security back in the black 
You dont have to worry about it being broke You dont have 
to worry about getting your checks And there I made a 
difference says Dole who never fails to add that Kemp voted 
against the Social Security rescue plan The New York congressman 
says he did so because of its increase in payroll taxes 
Kemp also argued that it was the improved economy and reduced 
unemployment that revived Social Securitys fortunes 
Kemps hardhitting ad campaign against Dole and Bush on Social 
Security has rekindled memories of the way Claude Pepper hammered 
Reagan and other Republicans for backing deep Social Security cuts 
in 1981 
Du Pont has accused Kemp of repeatedly misrepresenting his plan 
to allow workers to set up taxfree savings accounts if they 
relinquish future Social Security benefit rights Du Pont says 
Kemps attacks remind me of the demagoguery practices by the 
Democratic Party in the 1982 elections 
Some Republicans including Dole have said it was the 
Democrats pounding on senior citizens fear of Social Security 
cuts or freezes that cost the GOP control of the Senate in 1986 
On the Democrats side Babbitt has called for a universal 
needs test to discipline government programs including Social 
Security and suggested making wealthier retirees pay income tax on 
all their benefits instead of half 
Gary Hart also has suggested taxing 85 percent of the benefits 
The other Democrats generally have been vowing to safeguard 
Social Security and its COLAs 
Were going to keep it away from the Republican budget knives 
forever promises Missouri Rep Richard Gephardt 
Social Securitys trust funds which started 1988 with 67 
billion are expected to swell to 104 billion by the start of 1989 
and to top 400 billion by 1994 and 1 trillion before the end of 
the decade 
Ultimately Social Securitys trust fund is expected to peak at 
12 trillion 25 trillion in todays dollars around 2020 then 
be drawn down to nothing by 2050 to help pay the baby boomers 
retirement 
Du Pont and Robertson have argued that even before the trust 
funds are depleted there will be nothing in there but government 
IOUs To pay off those IOUs actually interestbearing Treasury 
bonds du Pont says we face a big tax increase 
When du Pont asked 80 people at a debate in Manchester NH 
how many thought Social Security would be there for them at 65 
three people raised their hands 
More scientific polls have shown young workers remain dubious 
about their personal prospects for Social Security 
But that sentiment has not translated into support for 
politicians such as du Pont and Babbitt who suggest overhauling or 
even tinkering with Social Security 
Maslin the Simon pollster said The elites have attempted to 
move the debate in a direction the voters dont want to move yet 
Young voters dont expect to get Social Security themselves Maslin 
said but they do expect it to be there for their parents 
For all of the provocation the voters are still on the side 
of protection said Maslin They understand that if the 
government does not provide those benefits they are going to have 
to pay for their parents retirement or health problems
