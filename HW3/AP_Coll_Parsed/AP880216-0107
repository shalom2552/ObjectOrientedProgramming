West Virginias financial troubles have 
eaten up the funds set aside for celebrating the 125th anniversary 
of statehood this summer 
Norman Fagan state Department of Culture and History 
commissioner said his agency had saved 100000 for the party But 
before the any plans could be completed the money was taken to 
help pay the states massive backlog of bills 
Well have something but it will be small and modest But 
that might be more appropriate Fagan said Tuesday 
The money would have been used to educate people about the 
anniversary provide grants for local governments to throw their 
own celebrations and print a special edition of a journal of West 
Virginia history 
In addition Fagan had hoped to have a shindig on the state 
Capitol grounds this summer as well as a celebration at 
Independence Hall in Wheeling 
Instead Fagan lamented Were down to a tiny ceremony 
West Virginia was granted statehood on June 20 1863 after 
delegates from the northwestern counties of what was then Virginia 
met in Wheeling and voted to join the North during the Civil War 
The 100000 fell victim to the states bills which amount to 
more than 200 million and are piling higher each day 
The Legislature is working on a measure that would allow Gov 
Arch Moore to borrow 50 million to pay some of the bills As part 
of that legislation Moore identified some areas where cuts in 
state spending could be made and that included the Department of 
Culture and History 
Nevertheless Fagan said the states anniversary wont go 
unnoticed Every year there is a celebration at Independence Hall 
and Fagan said this year will be no different 
Its too important in our history to let it go by he said
