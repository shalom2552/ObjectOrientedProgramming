To Alice Leitner her fiance is my Prince 
Charming 
Her Valentine present was a box wrapped in pink and fuchsia 
fabric 
When she opened the box in a parking stall Friday she found a 
65000 silver 560 SL MercedesBenz convertible coupe 
Leitner an architectural designer wont identify her 
boyfriend She says he has been very generous during their 
sevenyear relationship 
He always does very romantic surprises she said 
If I come home from a trip hell always have 10 dozen roses 
for me Once he gave me a ring with dolphins on it 
For her 1987 Valentines gift Leitner received a gold love 
bracelet which fastens with two gold screws He keeps the 
screwdriver 
Im so lucky she said on Friday This is better than a 
movie Hes my Prince Charming
