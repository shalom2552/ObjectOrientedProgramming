Sportswriter Dan Jenkins popularized the 
phrase dead solid perfect to describe a wellstruck golf shot 
and he wanted just that quality in the movie of his novel about a 
Cinderella barmaid named Juanita 
I like this one Jenkins says of Baja Oklahoma which 
Home Box Office will premiere this Saturday When Jenkins pro 
football novel SemiTough was made into a Burt Reynolds movie 
in 1977 most of the book had disappeared 
The adaptation of Baja Oklahoma is 500 times more faithful 
than what happened to SemiTough It was great having a producer 
and director busting their chops to make it more faithful 
Jenkins says 
Baja Oklahoma which is another way of saying Texas tells 
how Juanita Hutchins who works in Herbs Bar amp Grill finds true 
love with a guy named Slick and happiness as a country singer Her 
ticket to fame is her tune Baja Oklahoma Goodbye Pearl Beer 
and chickenfried steaks hello Nashville 
Lesley Ann Warren stars as Juanita Peter Coyote as Slick 
Swoosie Kurtz as Juanitas friend Doris Billy Vera as 
singersongwriter Lonnie and Anthony Zerbe as disc jockey Ol Jeemy 
Williams Bobby Roth directed from a screenplay by Roth and Jenkins 
In addition Willie Nelson Emmylou Harris and Bob Wills appear 
as themselves Alice Krige plays Patsy Cline The movie was filmed 
mostly on location in Texas with more than 2000 extras used in 
the scenes filmed at Billy Bobs Texas a huge honky tonk in Fort 
Worth 
Juanitas song of Baja Oklahoma was in the book as was her 
hero Willie Nelson 
Willies an old friend said Jenkins Ive known him for 
20 years I called him up and asked him if hed write the music for 
it We went up to Lake Tahoe where he was working and he wrote 
the music for two verses in 10 minutes Willie says It aint 
Stardust but it aint bad 
Jenkins has lived in New York City for more than 25 years but 
looks and sounds like he just came in from his hometown of Fort 
Worth Texas He still has a Texas drawl hes tall and still has 
most of his youthful slimness but his hair is white and thinning 
on top With his cigarette he could be a slightly overthehill 
Marlboro Man His wife June operates Mexican restaurants in Fort 
Worth New York and Florida named Juanitas after the heroine of 
Baja Oklahoma 
Jenkins spent 23 years as a senior writer at Sports Illustrated 
then left in 1984 to write a weekly syndicated column and columns 
for Sports Digest and Playboy magazines Hes also written four 
novels SemiTough Dead Solid Perfect Baja Oklahoma 
Life Its Ownself and Limo coauthored with Bud Shrake A 
fifth tentatively titled Dont Write Me Nothing That Rhymes a 
period comedy about the newspaper business is near completion 
I write comedy romances he said adding with a grin I 
write novels to support my journalism habit Journalisms my first 
love It keeps you alert I love novels but writing news is my 
real love 
One of his three children Sally Jenkins is a sportswriter for 
the Washington Post 
Baja Oklahoma has been through several typewriters on its 
way to becoming a movie Frank Pierson wrote the first two 
screenplays Joan Tewkesbury wrote another version 
Then I got a call from producer Marykay Powell asking me to 
write the screenplay Jenkins said It was going to be a 
theatrical picture with George Roy Hill directing and Shirley 
MacLaine playing Juanita It would have been a different movie 
more of a big comedy Now its more of a love story but we keep 
some of the comedy 
Given all the compromises you have to make adapting a novel to 
the screen it was a good experience It made me like Hollywood 
again 
Jenkins believes he can finish his latest book in about another 
month Its set in the 1930s and 40s so Ive had to do a lot of 
research he said I wanted everything to be accurate If 
somebodys talking about something in the news I want it to be 
right Its got a lot of old radio stuff too and thats all 
accurate Im a radio freak
