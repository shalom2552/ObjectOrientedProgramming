plans for a ship of return to take 130 deported Palestinians to 
Israel two days after the vessel was bombed in a Cyprus harbor

failed 
We have now decided to temporarily postpone the date of 
sailing said Sheik AbdulHamid alSayeh president of the 
Palestine National Council the PLO legislature He was the first 
person Israel deported after capturing Arab east Jerusalem in the 
1967 Middle East war 
He told a news conference the voyage would take place in the 
near future but organizers would not mention a date They sent 
home the hundreds of people including observers and journalists 
scheduled to make the trip who had been in Athens for nine days 
Those involved said it may have been the largest nonviolent 
protest ever attempted by the Palestine Liberation Organization 
Hanna Nasser a member of the organizing committee and 
interpreter for Sayeh called the effort a success because it has 
shown the world the amount of terrorism that is directed by Israel

Palestinian people going on a peaceful mission said Nasser who 
was president of Bir Zeit University in the Israelioccupied West 
Bank before he was deported

Corfu said that if the PLO gets another ship its fate will be 
the same

of war Bassan Abu Sharif PLO spokesman claimed earlier that 
Israel made the search for a ship difficult by threatening owners

deporting Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip

are illegal
