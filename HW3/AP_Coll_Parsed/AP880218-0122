Because parents of a child who was 
allegedly molested will not participate in a trial a federal judge 
dismissed the final molestation charge against a former Presidio 
Army base day care worker 
US District William Schwarzer took the action Wednesday after 
the US Attorneys Office learned the parents no longer were 
willing to participate in the April 4 trial 
Schwarzer dismissed the single charge that remained against Gary 
Hambright 34 
US Attorney Joseph Russoniello said investigators will 
continue examining evidence and his staff will see if theres not 
some way to put together a salvageable case that can be 
prosecuted 
That presented a lessoptimistic picture than was offered last 
week by two assistant US attorneys who vowed to return to a 
federal grand jury seeking new indictments against Hambright on 
more specific molestation charges after Schwarzer dismissed six 
charges because of vagueness 
Hambright once faced 11 molestation charges involving 10 
children Five counts contained in four charges were dismissed 
later when the government said there were evidentiary problems 
Hambrights case has been presented to a grand jury twice 
He had been charged in January 1987 with molesting a 2yearold 
boy at the day care center but was freed when the boy was found 
incapable of testifying and the judge refused to allow secondhand 
reports of his statements 
His indictment again last October triggered an investigation 
that resulted in the examination of almost 100 children from the 
day care center for signs of physical or psychological abuse
