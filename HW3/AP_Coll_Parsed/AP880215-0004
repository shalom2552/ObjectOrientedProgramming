When Pat Robertsons campaign bus pulls 
into shopping malls the driver turns on his tapes of John Philip 
Sousa marches and passersby strut on the sidewalks Inside 
Robertson and his aides are busy passing out a different type of 
cassette his positions on issues ranging from abortion to defense 
Robertsons campaign for the Republican nomination for the 
presidency is as much showmanship as it is politics Its one of 
the slickest shows in town now finishing its run in New Hampshire 
and heading South next 
At a major rally to fire up supporters Randall Brooks who 
starred as Annie in the smash Broadway musical 10 years ago sings 
the hit song Tomorrow 
And as the song goes you can bet your bottom dollar that 
Robertson is hoping the sun will come out tomorrow er Tuesday in 
the form of a strong showing in the New Hampshrie primary 
At a rally in Concord Saturday night youd have thought 
Robertson had already won his partys nomination It had all the 
trappings the straw hats and Robertson placards of a nominating 
convention 
Eight hundred supporters clapped stomped their feet and chanted 
We want Pat We want Pat 
Go Pat go Go Pat go 
Then of course Robertson came out on stage and whipped the 
crowd into a frenzy 
When I look at your faces and see this enthusiasm I believe 
we are going to see victory in New Hampshire he said Im 
talking to people who love America This state represents whats 
good in America because it stands for faith in God It stands for 
strong family values It stands for preservation of life for the 
unborn 
And when you ask around in the malls and at the rallies about 
Pat Robertson his followers tell you he stands for all those 
things Simple as that they say 
Kelly Griswold a mother of five children from Londonderry sang 
a couple of inspirational songs for Robertson 
One of them was Cant We Be Friends Cant we be 
friends Lifes too short Too soon it ends And good friends are 
so hard to find Cant we be friends Someone like you is one of a 
kind 
The second one Eagle Song she wrote herself An eagle 
tucked with golden wings is flying on his way upward heavenward 
bound 
I feel thats what Pats calling is she said later 
Thats what I believe Pat is meant to do Hes my man 
Martha Greer drove 30 miles from Laconia to see Robertson this 
night She explained that she was an 888 That means she found 
eight more voters to support Robertson in 88 
Hes a solid man she said He stands for a lot of good 
things He stands on the Bible for one thing Hes a good Christian 
man 
At the malls Robertson works the crowds relentlessly Hes in 
pizza parlors bookstores and barber shops smiling shaking hands 
embracing voters 
At a candy shop he wishes voters a happy Valentines Day then 
matteroffactly says to them I need some help on Tuesday
