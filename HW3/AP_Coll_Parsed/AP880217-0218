A judge Wednesday disputed a published 
report accusing him of approving a huge attorneys fee for Wedtech 
scandal figure E Robert Wallach after asking Wallach to lobby for 
his federal judgeship 
The San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday said thenSuperior Court 
Judge Eugene Lynch orally granted Wallach and his partner a 1 
million fee in September 1981 while the White House was 
considering Lynch for the federal bench 
Lynch was appointed a US District Court judge in January 1982 
Wallach in 1981 was the personal attorney of Attorney General 
Edwin Meese who at the time was a White House counselor 
Lynch said he has never been improperly influenced in any 
decision during his 16 years on the bench and he added I know 
of nothing that was improper or unusual about the process of my 
appointment to the federal bench 
The fee was awarded to Wallachs firm for representing two young 
sisters in a personal injury case It was reduced to 322000 in 
1982 by another judge on the grounds that it was excessive 
The article is misleading in at least one vital respect and 
should be corrected Lynch said in a statement 
Contrary to the storys implication Lynch said it is a 
matter of public record that I did not finally approve the 
attorneys fees that were the focus of the story He said a 
different judge ultimately set the amount 
A spokesman for the judge refused to say whether the judge had 
initially approved the 1 million to Wallachs firm according to 
The New York Times 
Lynch according to the Chronicle acknowledged seeking help 
from Wallach for the federal court appointment and said that 
Wallach was a friend of long standing 
Wallach strongly denied any connection between his endorsement 
of Lynch for the judgeship and the payment of attorneys fees the 
Chronicle said 
Wallach was indicted last month in New York on charges of 
influence peddling for allegedly taking payments from Wedtech Corp 
to lobby Meese before he became attorney general in order to get 
the company government contracts
