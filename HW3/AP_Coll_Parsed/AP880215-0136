Robert Redford has at least a few things in 
common with the average moviegoer For starters hes awed by Paul 
Newman And hed like to see his name alongside Newmans on a movie 
marquee again 
If I had to he said in an interview with Esquire magazine 
Id probably say that Newmans my best friend Hes the greatest 
Not much I wouldnt do for him 
After a recent evening with Newman Redford said he found 
himself thinking God heres old Paul He looks great feels 
great has lots of money gives to great causes hes in love with 
his wife he races his cars when he wants to makes a movie when he 
wants to hes incredibly happy and still has that face that looks 
the way it did when he was 20 
God by the time we got home I wanted to shoot myself 
Id love to make one more movie with him Redford added 
Just one more The two of us
