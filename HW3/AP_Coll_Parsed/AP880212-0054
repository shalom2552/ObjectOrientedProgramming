Democratic presidential hopeful Bruce 
Babbitts environmental record won him the gold star in a report 
card issued Friday by a national environmental watchdog group 
The League of Conservation Voters praised Babbitt and Republican 
presidential hopeful Pete du Pont for their stands on the 
environment while criticizing several other candidates notably 
Rep Jack Kemp 
The report gave the former Arizona governor high marks for his 
stands on air pollution acid rain land management and knowledge 
of worldwide problems such as depletion of the ozone layer and rain 
forests 
Also scoring well among the Democrats were Tennesee Sen Albert 
Gore and Illinois Sen Paul Simon with Missouri Rep Richard 
Gephardt getting the most lukewarm reception for votes on water and 
population issues 
Among Republicans du Ponts record in Congress on water 
pollution toxic waste cleanup and population issues won him the 
leagues highest score 
League Chairman Brent Blackwelder slammed several Republicans 
particularly Kemp and Vice President George Bush for their records 
and unwillingness to respond to questionnaires about their 
environmental views 
Kemps record has gotten markedly worse in our last two 
charts and the 50 percent grade we gave Bush is probably better 
than some of his recent statements might suggest Blackwelder 
said
