Anticipating higher numbers of refugees from 
Southeast Asia and Soviet bloc countries two organizations urged 
the United States on Friday to raise entry ceilings rather than 
shift immigration quotas among regions to compensate 
The US Committee for Refugees a refugee protection agency 
and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society migration agency of the US 
Jewish Community urged the Reagan administration and Congress to 
invoke emergency procedures of the 1980 US Refugee Act for 
raising the total number of admissions 
The administration has been considering a shift of 5000 from 
the Southeast Asian entry quota to provide for additional places 
for Soviet Jews and Armenians from Europe said USCR Director Roger 
P Winter in a statement 
Such a shift would have a disastrous impact on the safety of 
Vietnamese boat people refugees fleeing to Thailand Winter 
said This is because temporary refugee entry into Thailand depends 
on prospects for resettlement elsewhere 
The government is also proposing to reallocate 4000 entry 
places originally allocated for 1988 refugees from Africa the Near 
East and Latin America Winter said 
The increased refugee flow from the Soviet Union and other bloc 
countries is a direct result of the foreign policy successes of 
this administration said Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society official 
Karl D Zukerman in a telegram to Secretary of State George Shultz 
Such a challenge to our human rights and refugee policies 
cannot go unanswered nor should the lives and dignity of one set 
of refugees be balanced against others Zukerman said
