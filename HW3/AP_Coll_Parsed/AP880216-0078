Austrian President Kurt Waldheim says his 
service in Hitlers army reflects the normal fate of a young 
Austrian during World War II and says he wants the United States 
to release secret documents about his past 
In an interview on ABCTVs Nightline broadcast early today 
Waldheim reiterated that he had a clear conscience and would not 
step down as president despite growing opposition within Austria 
I have not hidden anything of my military career he said 
I think this whole accusation is unfounded 
He gave the 80minute interview to the network Monday 
immediately following a short televised speech to the Austrian 
nation In the speech he said that he rejects the conclusions of a 
panel of experts commissioned by the Austrian government to review 
his war record 
In a 202page report issued last week the six historians 
questioned Waldheims moral integrity saying he was in close 
proximity to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did nothing 
to stop them 
Though the panel said it found no evidence Waldheim 69 had 
committed war crimes it concluded he tried to cover up his 
involvement in World War II which was disclosed nearly two years 
ago during the presidential campaign 
In his interview with ABC Waldheim maintained that he could 
still function in the ceremonial post of Austrian president despite 
the controversy about his past He was elected in June 1986 with 
536 percent of the vote 
The 69yearold former United Nations secretarygeneral said the 
United States in putting him on a list of undesirable aliens last 
year had committed a serious violation of international law 
No state has a right to put a foreign head of state under its 
own jurisdiction he said 
Waldheim said he wanted to appeal the ruling and have the secret 
documents it was based on made public But he said the State 
Department said the only way to appeal the ruling was to apply for 
a visa which he said was unacceptable to a head of state 
Waldheim lashed out at those who said he is lying about what he 
knew and those who cite as evidence that in his writing about his 
past he left out the details of his military career He said his 
military service in Hitlers army was a common experience for 
Austrians 
If one pretends that I was lying because I did not give all 
the details of my military career right from the beginning this is 
not something that I can accept he said Serving in the German 
army was the normal fate of a young Austrian of lets say 20 22 
years of age To make him responsible for the wrongdoings of Hitler 
or the Nazi army which I condemned this is not fair 
At the end of the interview Waldheim appealed for understanding 
from the American people 
If I have misled my friends in the United States because I 
didnt say anything as far as my military career is concerned I am 
sorry It was not done purposely Believe me And I hope this 
will be understood because I have so many friends in the United 
States And I hope they will believe me that I havent done 
anything wrong
