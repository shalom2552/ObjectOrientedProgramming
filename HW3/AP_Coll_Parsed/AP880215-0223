The genes of people spiders mushrooms and most everything else 
are made of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA Each gene contains the 
code for assembling a protein thats used to build or regulate the 
organism When its protein is needed the gene spins off a mirror 
image of itself in a substance called ribonucleic acid or RNA The 
RNA is shuttled to the cells protein assembly factory where it 
serves as a temporary blueprint 
Retrovirus genes are backwards They are made of RNA To get 
going the virus has to translate them into DNA This is the job of 
enzymes made by a gene called pol 
Like other retroviruses HIV has three basic genes Besides pol 
they are env which makes gp120 and gp41 to form the outer shell 
and gag which creates the protein needed for the viruss inner 
core 
However unlike simple retroviruses HIV has at least four 
regulatory genes and probably more They are called tat art sor 
and 3orf Even though scientists have worked out the entire 
genetic code of the AIDS viruss RNA they are not sure how many 
genes are involved in all Some of them overlap sharing stretches 
of RNA while other genes are spliced together from here and there 
along the strand of RNA 
The pol gene produces polymerase and ribonuclease H known 
jointly as reverse transcriptase as well as protease and 
integrase Together these enzymes transcribe RNA into DNA clean 
it up and insert it neatly into the cells own genes where it 
becomes a permanent part of the bodys genetic library 
All the pieces are in place for the virus to instruct the cell 
to turn its attention toward making and assembling viral proteins 
In T4 helper cells however this usually doesnt happen Even 
though one in five of them may be infected only about one in 
10000 is actually producing viral proteins In the rest of them 
the virus lies quiet or latent 
It can come to life only when the T4 helper cell itself is 
stimulated by some immunological emergency to divide and produce 
new cells This is not true of monocytes and macrophages In these 
cells the virus can make a slow steady stream of new viruses or 
suddenly explode with activity But whether any of these infected 
cells actually churn out new viruses depends on an intricate 
interplay between the viruss regulatory genes 
Among the most intriguing of these is tat Its a kind of 
fastforward switch Tat produces a protein that causes the other 
genes to work faster It can speed up virus production 1000fold 
The tat protein even makes the tat gene work harder It becomes a 
positive feedback regulator triggering runaway viral production 
However tat has an alter ego called 3orf pronounced 
threeprimeorf It slows down virus replication and it may be 
one way that the virus establishes latent infection 
Another way is through the art gene also known as trs Art is a 
kind of switch When art is turned on the virus makes the 
structural proteins necessary for constructing new copies of 
itself But when art is turned off it makes only the regulatory 
proteins 
Finally there is sor Its protein somehow makes the virus more 
infectious so it spreads more rapidly through the body 
Using these genes HIV transforms useful cells into virus 
factories Most of the infected cells survive even though they are 
making virus However the T4 helper cells eventually die and they 
are killed in two ways 
When cells are infected with HIV they often display copies of 
the viruss envelop protein on their own surface The envelop 
protein is highly attracted to the T4 molecule This turns the 
infected cell in a sort of giant virus roaming the bloodstream in 
search of cells with T4 on them When it finds one it sticks to 
it This results in clumps of 100 to 500 cells known as syncytia 
and all of them eventually die 
The T4 helper cells may also die through a process called 
autofusion The surfaces of these cells contain so much envelop 
protein and T4 that its skin folds over onto itself and sticks 
together Each place that envelop protein and T4 touch a hole is 
punched The cell grows leaky and explodes 
How did HIV get to be such an efficient killer Probably by 
accident 
Most viruses whether they cause flu cold sores or warts dont 
kill their hosts A dead host after all is a very poor host 
Instead they cause passing illnesses or lifelong infections that 
may be aggravating but arent lethal 
The AIDS epidemic is just a slight miscalculation on the 
viruss part Haseltine says It could be a single mutation in 
almost any one of the regulatory pathways It allows it to make too 
much virus too quickly in T4 cells and that allows it to be more 
easily transmitted and more lethal It could be one single mutation 
that separates us from no epidemic and this terrible epidemic
