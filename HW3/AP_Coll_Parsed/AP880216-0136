A Conrail engineer who ran a stop signal and 
caused an Amtrak crash that killed 16 people pleaded guilty to one 
count of manslaughter Tuesday in a bargain that will bring him no 
worse than five years in jail and a 1000 fine 
Rick L Gates 33 who was scheduled to begin a trial on 16 
counts of manslaughter by locomotive was operating the three 
linked Conrail engines Jan 4 1987 when they skidded in front of 
an Amtrak passenger train carrying 660 people The worst accident 
in Amtraks history left 16 dead and more than 170 injured 
Gates was granted the guilty verdict after attorneys agreed to 
include in the single misdemeanor count the names of all 16 
fatalities Prosecutors reserved the right to ask for the maximum 
sentence of five years and 1000 
Baltimore County Circuit Judge Joseph F Murphy set sentencing 
for March 29 Gates remained free on 11500 bail 
Despite the admission by Gates and brakeman Edward Cromwell that 
they smoked marijuana in the cab prosecutors said expert witnesses 
were unable to render an opinion regarding impairment Blood 
and urine samples showed that both men tested positive for 
marijuana 
This is the firstever manslaughter by locomotive verdict 
said Sandra OConnor Baltimore County states attorney and the 
chief prosecutor This will send a message that operators 
cannot work under the kind of negligence that Mr Gates did 
But prosecutors she said were not certain the judge would have 
sentenced Gates if convicted to 16 consecutive fiveyear terms 
Mrs OConnor said one reason she decided to accept the plea 
agreement was the recent federal appeals court ruling against 
automatic postaccident drug testing for all railroad workers 
Families of victims survivors and friends filled the small 
courtroom some crying and others shaking their heads while a 
prosecutor read a 42page statement of facts detailing the crash 
and actions by Gates and Cromwell 
After the hearing Gates told reporters outside the courthouse 
I am ultimately responsible for the crash and for my negligence 
I cant begin to imagine the pain and grief of the families I am 
sorry 
The sentence is woefully inadequate said Arthur Johnson a 
founder of Safe Travel America whose daughter Christy was killed 
in the crash 
I am grossly disappointed that he can cause tens of millions 
of dollars in damage and kill 16 people and still face only five 
years on a misdemeanor charge said Dr Roger Horn whose 
16yearold daughter Ceres was killed 
Cromwell who was not charged was granted immunity from 
prosecution and was scheduled to testify against Gates 
The statement agreed to by both sides blamed Gates for missing 
two track signals and allowing the locomotives to skid through a 
switch where four tracks converge to two about 600 yards before the 
Gunpowder River Bridge crossing 
The statement revealed that Gates lied to the National 
Transportation Safety Board about the track signals and about his 
and Cromwells drug use on the train 
According to the statement the first signal 17 miles from the 
switch indicated that the Conrail engines should slow down and stop 
before crossing onto the Amtrak track Gates had insisted the 
signal told him to proceed 
The statement blamed Gates for failing to replace a cab warning 
light bulb and fix a whistle that was taped over Either warning 
device would have alerted Gates to the stop signals the statement 
said 
The statement also reported that Cromwell said he and Gates had 
smoked part of a marijuana cigarette in the cab shortly after 
leaving Baltimore 
Following the crash Cromwell ran back to the Conrail engines to 
get his marijuana pipe which he then discarded in the yard of a 
nearby home the statement said He left the scene while Gates 
stayed to help the rescue effort the statement said 
Gates and Cromwell met at Cromwells home on Jan 6 the night 
before they met with NTSB investigators and agreed to a version of 
the events that would not incriminate either of them
