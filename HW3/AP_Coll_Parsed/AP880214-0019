A nuclear accident was averted with minutes to 
spare aboard a British submarine in Scotland last month the 
Observer newspaper reported Sunday The Ministry of Defense denied 
there had been a crisis 
No public announcement had been made earlier about the incident 
On Sunday a ministry spokesman who wouldnt be identified said 
There was no emergency There was no possibility of anybody crew 
or general public being subjected to any radiation problems There 
was a minor electrical malfunction but no radioactive material was 
released 
The spokesman said the weekly was incorrect in claiming a 
nuclear accident was averted by minutes 
The Observer said that on Jan 26 at the nuclear submarine 
base at Faslane near Glasgow a fault developed in the primary 
cooling system of the nuclear reactor power plant on HMS 
Resolution the oldest of Britains four operational nuclear 
submarines commissioned in 1967 
The fault led to heat building up in the reactors core 
threatening a meltdown and potential disaster was only averted 
when two of the crew ran to start up a diesel generator to provide 
alternative power for the cooler the report said 
It said there was only between 1 and 7 minutes for the crew to 
take action and one of the two crewmen had to be scrubbed down for 
24 hours afterward because he was exposed to radiation 
A meltdown could have released radioactivity contaminating 2000 
square miles with devastating consequences for the 13000 
people living within a fivemile radius of the base the report 
said
