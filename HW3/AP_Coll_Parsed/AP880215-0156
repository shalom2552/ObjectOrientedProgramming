Pat Robertson defending his stance on womens 
issues says women hold top posts in his campaign and he expects to 
appoint women to a Robertson Cabinet 
Robertson in a Republican presidential debate Sunday night in 
Goffstown NH rejected criticism from the National Organization 
for Women but said that if working women are given tax deductions 
for child care then homemakers deserve tax breaks too 
The former television evangelist called NOW a very militant 
rather leftwing organization and said he would not trust one 
word that they said about his positions on womens issues 
NOW vice president Sheri ODell responded Monday Id have 
more cause for concern if he said something complimentary about 
us 
She said that Robertson has made clear in his writings speeches 
and sermons over the years that as a NOW summary of the 
candidates positions put it he advocates oldfashioned family 
values and the return of women to the traditional roles 
What that means is he believes women are to be submissive to 
men in the home in the workplace in anyplace said ODell He 
tries to use Biblical references to support that position 
The fifth chapter of Pauls letter to the Ephesians says wives 
must be submissive to their husbands Robertson has cited the verse 
in writings and on the religious television show he used to host 
The 700 Club according to ODell 
If the top campaign person on his staff is a woman I 
congratulate him Maybe hes making some progress on his point of 
view said ODell 
Robertson was asked by moderator Edwin Newman about a NOW 
political summary that concluded he favored a return of women to 
their traditional role 
Robertson replied I have more women in my campaign right now 
than any other presidential candidate sitting here or any of the 
Democrats The highest paid staff member I have is a woman 
His campaign headquarters in Chesapeake Va said he was 
referring to Connie Snapp his national director of communications 
Asked if Snapp earned more than Marc Nuttle Robertsons 
campaign director and chief political strategist Teresa George a 
campaign press aide said Nuttle is a consultant He is not 
actually on our staff so she is the highest paid person on the 
staff She said the campaign would not disclose Snapps salary or 
Nuttles compensation 
She added that women hold 160 of the 300 paid positions in the 
Robertsons national office and field staff 
Robertson also said his advertising was run by a woman and that 
Mary Ellen Miller runs his national voter identification drive 
All of the candidates except Michael Dukakis have men in charge 
of their campaigns Harvard law professor Susan Estrich is Dukakis 
campaign manager 
Robertson said he would appoint women to his Cabinet and added 
as a matter of fact theres one of those Doles would make a 
fantastic vice president 
When the moderator pressed him Robertson said I would say 
that the National Organization for Woman with all due deference is 
a very militant rather leftwing organization I dont know that I 
would trust one word that they said 
I do not feel that radical feminism is necessary for us today 
And what I think we should have in this society if a woman wants 
to work I want absolutely to maek sure that she gets the same pay 
as a man But if she wants to stay home for example and look 
after children I am advocating that if we can give tax deductions 
for childcare support for working women we can also give tax 
deductions to women who want to stay home and look after their 
children
