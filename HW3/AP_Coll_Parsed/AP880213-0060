Two hundred years after a group of men gathered 
to write the Constitution women and minorities are closing in on 
equal status but still have many hurdles to cross Coretta Scott 
King told a national symposium 
Mrs King wife of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King 
Jr said Friday that criticism of the Constitution as it was 
adopted in 1787 is justified 
Her speech came in the closing day of a symposium on women and 
the Constitution convened by former first ladies Rosalynn Carter 
and Lady Bird Johnson About 1500 women from all 50 states and 10 
foreign countries attended 
Some people apparently feel that blacks and women should join 
in an uncritical celebration of a document that protected the slave 
trade and denied women their democratic rights Mrs King said 
We still have a way to go before we can say that the Constitution 
is working for all Americans 
Mrs King echoed another speaker at the symposium 1984 vice 
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro in calling for more 
political activism on the part of women 
If America is to fulfill the promise of the Constitution we 
will need many more women of all races holding elective office 
Mrs King said We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for 
nurturing and compassion which has been finely honed and tempered 
in our struggle to raise families in a sexist society 
We just might save this nation from its pending apointment 
with Armageddon she said 
Mrs King said the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s 
laid the groundwork for the womens rights movements of the years 
that followed She said the kind of organized nonviolent dissent 
championed by her late husband is still an effective form of 
protest 
The civil rights movement showed millions of Americans that 
you can indeed you must defy authority when that authority is in 
the wrong Mrs King said 
Earlier Friday Ms Ferraro said that while no women are among 
the candidates for president in either party women have reached 
higher levels in the campaign organizations than ever before 
The women who hold positions of responsibility in presidential 
campaigns whether or not their candidate is ultimately successful 
will forge contacts and gain credibility that will endure beyond 
this election cycle she said 
Many of them will be back with higher ambitions and sharper 
skills in 1992 Ms Ferraro said 
Ms Ferraro whose presence on the 1984 Democratic ticket with 
Walter Mondale was a high point for the womens movement said the 
women in some of the 1988 campaigns will go on to be advisers to 
the next president 
And thats important too she said The current 
administration has widely been regarded as hostile to womens 
issues That is in part because this presidents inner circle of 
advisers have except for his wife been men
