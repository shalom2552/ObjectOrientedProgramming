A Soviet rocket exploded before 
reaching orbit this week and debris believed to be from the blast 
landed off Australia with another chunk expected to hit Earth on 
Saturday a defense official said 
We are trying to identify it and project an entry area We 
cant do that right now but should get that sometime tomorrow 
morning Bob Hollie a North American Aerospace Defense Command 
spokesman said Thursday 
One chunk believed to have been a foundation piece that held 
three satellites to a Soviet Proton rocket launched sometime this 
week came down off the southern coast of Australia Hollie said 
A second piece wont make it past the earths atmosphere but a 
third being tracked by NORAD is believed to be too big to burn up 
before hitting Earth Hollie said 
They may or may not be related to the Proton launch by the 
Soviet Union Hollie said We are not saying they are or are 
not The problem we have is they never made it into orbit The 
rocket blew up before it attained orbit 
Hollie said its hard to say right now if the debris poses 
any danger We dont know exactly how big the piece is he 
said but added that it is bigger than the piece that hit near 
Australia 
Because of the low orbit it is very hard for the US Space 
Command to track it Hollie said 
The Space Command also located near Colorado Springs tracks 
satellites rockets and space debris NORAD tracks of bombers and 
missiles
