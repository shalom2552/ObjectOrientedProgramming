The Panchen Lama Tibets No 2 religious leader 
and generally a supporter of Chinese policy says Beijings 
leftist ideology helped spark last falls violent antiChinese 
riots in the province 
The 49yearold high priest speaking to Tibets legislature 
last month also contradicted Chinese statements that no Tibetans 
were shot by police in a riot on Oct 1 
Western journalists reported as many as 14 Tibetans and ethnic 
Chinese were killed 
The Panchen Lama said most police followed orders not to fire on 
crowds in central Lhasa the Tibetan capital but that warning 
shots ricocheted injuring or killing people One person died after 
being hit directly by a bullet he said 
The demonstrations called for an end to Chinese domination over 
the remote mountain area China which claims Tibet has been an 
integral part of Chinese territory for seven centuries gained firm 
control after its army entered Tibet in 1950 
The Panchen Lamas Jan 19 speech was carried by Radio Tibet and 
seen Monday in a report by a British Broadcasting Corp monitoring 
service He returned to his home in Beijing from Tibet this week 
after a monthlong inspection tour 
When we arrived in Tibet we found that comrades of the Han 
nationality were angry as were comrades of the Tibetan 
nationality he said Hans are ethnic Chinese 
The Panchen Lama agreed with Chinese officials that the 
incidents were mainly caused by splittists inside and outside 
Tibet who colluded with each other 
But he added that over a period of more than 20 years under 
the guidance of erroneous leftist ideology we did many wrong 
things that we should not have done and we should correct these 
mistakes We left wounds in the minds of many people and need to 
cure such wounds 
Tibet was devastated in the 196676 Cultural Revolution during 
which Red Guards destroyed Buddhist temples persecuted people for 
their religious beliefs and tried to suppress the customs and 
language of the remote mountain area 
The Panchen Lama was critical of Chinese reports on the 
disturbances saying there were many misinterpretations because few 
Chinese journalists spoke Tibetan 
Reporters wrote their reports in Chinese according to these 
inaccurate interpretations and the editors or editorsinchief 
revised the reports according to the requirements of such 
reports he said 
The official Chinese media in a campaign to emphasize the 
government position on Tibet has carried hundreds of reports about 
Tibetans who condemn the rioters monks who regret their actions in 
the riots and social and economic progress in the area 
The reports have increased this week with the approach of a 
twoweek religious festival that attracts thousands of Tibetan 
pilgrims to Lhasa The Panchen Lama confirmed that officials 
considered canceling the festival because of concerns of possible 
violence 
The Panchen Lama is a loyal supporter of Chinese policy in 
contrast to the man considered Tibets religious leader the Dalai 
Lama 
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 and lives in exile in India 
The Chinese government says his antiChinese statements and calls 
for Tibetan independence were the main cause of the riots which 
were led by monks 
The Panchen Lama spent nine years under house arrest for 
refusing to denounce the Dalai Lama and was not permitted to visit 
Tibet again until 1982
