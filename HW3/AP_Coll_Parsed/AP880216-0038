Less than a week after deciding to permit 
closed meetings during the trial of impeached Gov Evan Mecham the 
state Senate is considering whether to scrap the idea 
Senators also decided Monday to reconsider whether to begin the 
trial Feb 22 as scheduled or agree to Mechams request and delay 
it until after his criminal trial 
Majority Leader Robert Usdane urged his fellow senators Monday 
to change rules adopted Thursday that would allow them to hold 
closed discussions at the request of only one senator 
Even though it was never the intent of the Senate to hide from 
the public or to railroad or exonerate the governor in private 
the press has intimated that this type of situation would not only 
be possible but probable behind closed doors Usdane said 
In a formal motion filed later Monday Mechams attorneys also 
asked for open discussions 
Absent a compelling reason the principals of fundamental 
fairness dictates that every moment of these impeachment 
proceedings the importance and gravity of which cannot be 
overstated be witnessed by the citizens of this state and 
nation defense attorney Rick Miller wrote 
Surreptitious meetings held in smokefilled back rooms will 
cast a dark cloud of suspicion over the hearings he added 
calling it nothing but a farce sham and a mockery for the 
Senate to meet secretly 
A twothirds vote is required to change the rules 
The president of the Arizona Newspapers Association Joe 
Soldwedel praised Usdanes appeal We would like all of the 
proceedings to be in public he said The Associated Press has 
filed a similar request 
Usdane in a letter to Senate President Carl Kunasek and 
Minority Leader Alan Stephens urged that all deliberations be in 
public and that closed meetings either be banned entirely or at 
least require a majority vote 
This will allow the public to know the senators who voted for 
a closed conference he said 
Usdane also said he might boycott closed meetings if the changes 
are not adopted 
Several rankandfile Republicans said they favored a change 
and Stephens a Democrat said he believed his caucus also would be 
willing to go along with changes 
Mecham is accused by a House resolution of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan lending 80000 to his car dealership from the 
governors protocol fund and obstructing justice The Republican 
governor has said repeatedly that he is innocent of all wrongdoing 
Mecham also faces a criminal indictment over the 350000 loan 
and a May 17 recall election precipitated by a petition drive
