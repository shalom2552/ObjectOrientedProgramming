The Journal of the American Medical Association 
says it will not comply with an order to name an essayist who 
claimed in a recent issue to have committed a mercy killing 
A subpoena was served Tuesday by the Cook County states 
attorneys office regarding a Jan 8 essay titled Its Over 
Debbie said Kirk Johnson general counsel for the nations 
largest organization of doctors 
Although the AMA strongly condemns mercy killing its 
journal will not comply with the subpoena he said in a statement 
Dr George Lundberg the editor in chief of JAMA has invoked 
the privilege protecting information obtained by reporters in the 
course of their work as provided in the Illinois Reporters 
Privilege Act Johnson said 
The act says a person seeking privileged or protected 
information must apply in writing to the circuit court to set aside 
the protection he said 
The act also says the court may overrule the privilege only 
when after a hearing it finds all other sources have been 
exhausted and disclosure of the information is essential to 
protection of the public interest said Johnson 
Because the states attorneys office has not complied with 
these requirements of the act JAMA will not comply with the 
subpoena the attorney said 
Terry Levin a spokesman for the prosecutors office said 
Tuesday We have no comment and in fact are not confirming we 
are even looking into this 
In the article a doctor described injecting a fatal dose of 
morphine into a terminally ill young woman he had never seen before 
who suffered from ovarian cancer 
AMA officials have said they did not verify the purported mercy 
killing but believe it was based on fact They said the author 
requested anonymity 
Handing over information would inhibit JAMA and other media 
from publishing information from sources who wish to remain 
anonymous Johnsons statement said Thus disclosure would 
strike at the heart of the Reporters Privilege Act and the First 
Amendment interests which it seeks to protect 
The AMA and its journal are based in Chicago The essay did not 
indicate where the author lived or where the purported incident 
took place
