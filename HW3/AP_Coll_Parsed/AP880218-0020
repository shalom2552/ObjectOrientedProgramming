Stories abound that prostitutes 
frequently visit ice fishing houses on Mille Lacs Lake where as 
many as 10000 men gather on winter weekends but authorities say 
they may just be fish stories 
Personally Ive never run across the hooks but I remember 
they were supposed to be working the lake back in the 60s said 
Jerry Anderson a fishing guide on the large central Minnesota lake 
whose shoreline includes this town 
At least it makes a nice story January and February can be a 
real boring time of year up here he said 
But Jim Forbord a state conservation officer who has worked the 
lake for nine years said he wouldnt be surprised if truth is 
found in one of two theories Prostitutes peddle their wares 
fishhouse door to fishhouse door or they do business in their own 
fishhouse 
When you check houses you run into everything under the sun 
he said You dont know if theyre girlfriends boyfriends wives 
or what Sometimes I have to let them pull on a blanket before I 
come in 
Authorities say no arrests or prosecutions on prostitution 
charges have been made in any of the three counties that include 
parts of the lake 
Last fall however an Aitkin County sheriffs deputy 
investigated a report that two local women were operating as 
prostitutes on the southeast shore said Sheriff Bill Sobey The 
report seemed credible but there wasnt enough evidence to make an 
arrest he said 
I used to always figure it was just talk Sobey said Ive 
never had a fishhouse myself so Ive never had a chance to find 
out 
He believes authorities would know if prostitutes were active in 
the area Youd hear something People talk he said 
Crow Wing County Attorney Stephen Rathke said Id heard of it 
for years and I guess Ive always assumed it was true because its 
so logical You know literally thousands of men in these little 
fish houses 
This winter there are nearly 4000 fish houses on the lake 
giving the frozen lake a bigger population than any of the cities 
on its shore 
Youve got to realize you get a real rowdy crew out there 
said Anderson Theres gambling seeing who can drink the most 
Maybe thats how the stories start 
Forbord has his own theory about the stories Fishermen like 
to talk a pretty good brag When you spend all weekend staring at a 
bobber you start thinking about something else to do
