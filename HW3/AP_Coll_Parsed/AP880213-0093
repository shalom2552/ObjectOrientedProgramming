The historians who determined Kurt 
Waldheim knew of and did nothing to stop Nazi atrocities were 
practically all his enemies Socialists and Jews an old friend 
and close aide to the president charged 
In their report the historians condemned Waldheim for not 
objecting to the atrocities they said he must have been aware of as 
a German army intelligence officer in the Balkans during World War 
II but said it found no proof he committed war crimes 
Today the West German news magazine Der Spiegel which 
published a telegram purportedly linking Waldheim to the 
deportation of civilians to concentration camps during the war 
said the document was a fake and it apologized for printing it 
Spiegel regrets that it presented this document to its 
readers as the proof of Waldheims involvement and not with the 
necessary distance the magazine said It said a document expert 
Bernhard Haas had concluded the telegram was in all likelihood a 
fake 
The commission that studied Waldheims wartime past did not have 
access to the original telegram 
The commission they were not his friends they were 
practically all his enemies Karl Gruber said Friday The 
German is a Socialist the others are of Jewish descent he said 
referring to West German historian Manfred Messerschmidt and the 
five other members of the international panel 
Commission Chairman Hans Rudolf Kurz a Swiss historian 
rejected Grubers allegations of bias saying the panels members 
were hired for their scientific expertise and had not acted as 
Waldheims enemies 
In an interview with Austrian Television Kurz reacted angrily 
to Grubers comment about the governmentappointed panel being 
comprised of people of Jewish descent 
He said he chose Israeli Professor Yehuda Wallach a Jew 
because I have known him for many years as an outstanding 
scientist Only later did he learn that British commission member 
Gerald Fleming was also Jewish he added 
Gruber a resistance fighter against the Nazis was Austrias 
first foreign minister after the war and brought Waldheim into the 
diplomatic service His comments to Italian television were 
broadcast on Austrian radio 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky a Socialist sent telegrams to each 
commission member apologizing for Grubers remarks which he said 
have nothing in the slightest to do with the governments view of 
your work 
Austrias Jewish community in a telex to news organizations 
said Grubers statement expressed the deepest hatred of Jews 
Vranitzkys government appointed the commission at Waldheims 
request in September after the US Justice Department put the 
president on a watch list of undesirable aliens that bars him 
from the United States 
Accusations that he committed war crimes arose during the former 
UN secretarygenerals election campaign in 1986 
Waldheims office said he will make a fiveminute address on 
national television Monday but a spokesman said he could not 
disclose its contents 
The president has consistently refused to resign and said this 
week he will stay in office despite the historians report which 
left open the questions of guilt and moral responsibility The 
202page document was presented to the government Monday 
About 500 intellectuals gathered outside Waldheims offices in 
the imperial Hofburg palace at dusk Friday and handed in a petition 
demanding his resignation Organizers said they collected 1200 
signatures 
Another antiWaldheim demonstration by prominent intellectuals 
is planned for Sunday 
When asked about Grubers comment that he was a Socialist 
Messerschmidt described himself as a lifelong liberal who never has 
belonged to a political party Critics of the commission should 
do their research better he said
