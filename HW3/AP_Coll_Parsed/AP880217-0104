A fire broke out today in an unoccupied 
fifthfloor room of the US Embassy in Moscow forcing about 150 
people to flee the building to a snowstorm outside 
Flames leaped from windows on the fifth floor of the aging 
10story building and smoke continued to pour out for an hour 
after it was evacuated 
Soviet firefighters were summoned to the scene in midafternoon 
and were escorted by US Marine guards into the embassy compound 
The blaze apparently began in an unoccupied room in an area 
undergoing renovation 
Philip Brown a senior embassy spokesman said the cause of the 
fire had not been determined No injuries were reported 
The building leased to the United States by the Soviet 
government since the 1950s was to have been replaced by a new 
diplomatic complex But the embassy building at the center of that 
complex remains vacant and unfinished following discovery that it 
was riddled with Soviet eavesdropping devices 
About 150 embassy employees were in the building when the fire 
broke out Ambassador Jack Matlock was not at the embassy at the 
time but returned after the evacuation press attache Richard 
Gilbert said 
Gilbert said the fire might be construction related but it 
has not been determined The spokesman said there was no serious 
damage to the main working areas of the embassy which are located 
on the sixth floor and above 
Most of the 40 apartments once used by guards and diplomats have 
been vacated in recent months as officials have moved into the 
modern brick townhouses that surround the new embassy building 
The diplomats and embassy workers were ordered out of their 
offices and stood on the sidewalk in a snowstorm to watch firemen 
combat the fire 
The blaze occurred in a section of the building that had been 
used to house Navy Seabees members of construction battalions 
and workers brought to Moscow on temporary assignment But a 
spokesman said the corner room where the fire broke out was not 
being occupied at the time 
Much of the building which is in poor repair is under 
renovation while officials in Washington ponder what to do with 
their new embassy building less than a block away 
A Soviet fire official said the blaze was confined to one room 
and that no injuries were reported Embassy employees were told to 
take the rest of the day off because the building could not be 
occupied for at least several hours 
Brown said embassy officials decided about 30 minutes after the 
blaze was discovered that they couldnt contain it without 
assistance and Moscow fire trucks were called to the scene 
Marine guards who are responsible for security inside the 
compound escorted the firemen and their vehicles into the 
courtyard of the prerevolutionary mansion and accompanied the 
firefighters as they trained hoses on the blaze and entered the 
main embassy building with gas masks and extinguishers 
US Reps Dan Mica DFla and Olympia Snowe RMaine during 
an inspection of the embassy last April pronounced it a firetrap 
and unsafe by accepted standards for general working conditions 
A more serious fire ravaged the top floors of the embassy 
building in August 1977 Officials said afterward the damage was 
particularly severe because Ambassador Malcolm Toon refused to 
permit Soviet firefighters to enter the topsecurity embassy 
communications center and some of its most sensitive work areas to 
combat the blaze 
In Washington a senior official said the fire was contained to 
an unclassified area and was unrelated to talks that Secretary of 
State George P Shultz will open Sunday with Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A Shevardnadze 
The fire was a fire said Assistant Secretary of State 
Rozanne L Ridgway It would be totally wrong it would be 
fiction to try to have it have anything to do with the upcoming 
visit 
Shultz will hold talks with Shevardnadze on arms control 
negotiations human rights and a prospective withdrawal of Soviet 
troops from Afghanistan They also will make preparations for a 
summit meeting in Moscow next spring between President Reagan and 
General Secretary Mikhail S Gorbachev 
Ms Ridgway who is in charge of the European bureau at the 
State Department and will accompany Shultz said the fire 
affected our communications somewhat with the embassy and that 
she did not have all the details 
The embassy and its operations in Moscow have been the center of 
controversy for more than a year 
A scandal exploded around accusations that Marine guards 
influenced by Soviet women with whom they were illicitly 
associating had permitted Soviet agents inside secret areas of the 
embassy when no diplomats were present Those charges were never 
proved but a Marine was convicted in August of espionage 
Officials disclosed in 1986 that the new 191 million embassy 
already five years behind schedule would not be finished or 
occupied until they decided whether it could be made secure from 
electronic bugs 
Proposals include razing part or all of the new building or 
building a new structure in the complex to house communications 
facilities and secret operations
