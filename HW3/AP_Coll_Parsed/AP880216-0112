President Reagan says that he and his wife of 35 
years cope with crisis together because She has made it so 
natural for us to be as one that we never face anything alone 
Reagan in an article in the March issue of McCalls magazine on 
his relationship with his second wife was asked how she is helping 
him cope with the Irancontra affair 
Its always our problem to be dealt with as something 
affecting the two of us he said Nancy sees this problem as 
something that happened to us together 
Mrs Reagan said she shared that sense of devotion I knew I 
was in love when I became more concerned about Ronnie than about 
myself 
The pair were married in March 1952 after 11 months of 
courtship that began with kind of a blind date said Reagan 
then an actor In case things didnt click I told her on the 
phone that I had an early call on the set the next morning so that 
evenings date would have to be short 
The couple ended up staying out late listening to Sophie Tucker 
at a nightclub Since that date 37 years ago Nancy has been the 
leading lady of my heart Reagan said 
Anything hed like to change about his leading lady 
Well Nancy worries when she thinks something might upset me 
or might go wrong Reagan said If she would only realize that 
nothing important can go wrong as long as I have her
