Nude drawings of women that county 
officials ordered removed from a courthouse gallery cannot be 
barred from the exhibit a federal judge ruled today 
Judge Edwin M Kosiks order allows the works by artist Joseph 
Ray to be hung immediately and they could be put back up today 
said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Stefan Presser 
This is what makes us different from the Soviet Union Were 
not supposed to have Big Brother saying You can look at 
landscapes and you cant look at nudes Presser said 
Ray an East Stroudsburg artist and psychology professor hung 
the nudes in a display of 50 charcoal drawings Feb 5 The show at 
the courthouse lasts until Feb 26 
Monroe County commissioners and President Judge James R Marsh 
objected to the nudes and Ray agreed to remove them because he did 
not want to jeopardize the rest of the exhibit But he sued county 
officials 
Ray argued that his rights under the First and 14th amendments 
were violated when his paintings were barred from public display 
Kosik ruling after a halfhour hearing said the Fred M Waring 
Gallery in the courthouse was wellestablished and could not be 
censored County officials established the gallery about 10 years 
ago 
They have indeed elected to enlighten or otherwise to open the 
public court as a designated forum for the display of art 
Kosik said 
Daniel M Corveleyn assistant county solicitor had argued the 
art should be screened because people often had to pass the gallery 
for court business and not by choice 
He later said the commissioners would not appeal the ruling 
Ray sought unspecified damages but that was not addressed in 
Kosiks ruling
