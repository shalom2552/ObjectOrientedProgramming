Comedian Red Skelton and singer Mary 
Martin were among the friends who gathered to remember composer 
Frederick Loewe as a man who could make life laugh and sing like 
the Broadway musicals he helped create 
The tragedy of my life is that I never did get to do a musical 
with him Miss Martin stage star of South Pacific and The 
Sound of Music told about 75 friends and fans at an outdoor 
memorial service at Loewes estate here Wednesday 
Skelton a friend for 32 years called Loewes music the pomp 
and splendor of life a celestial sound that inspires happiness 
Loewe who combined his music with the words of Alan Jay Lerner 
to create such Broadway classics as Brigadoon My Fair 
Lady Paint Your Wagon and Camelot died Sunday of heart 
failure He was 86 
The twotime Tony Award winner and cowriter of memorable tunes 
like I Could Have Danced All Night If Ever I Would Leave 
You and Thank Heaven for Little Girls was buried after a 
private graveside service in nearby Cathedral City 
At the public gathering Skelton recalled flashes of Loewes 
humor His responding to a compliment that the music in Gigi 
grew on people by calling the show a musical fungus and 
quipping that the best thing about rock music was that a listener 
couldnt tell if his record was scratched 
Life was truly a feast for him said friend Gloria Greer 
and he wanted to enjoy and savor every bit of it 
Dorothy Hart sisterinlaw of composer Lorenz Hart said Loewe 
had a flair for the extravagant even before he made it big 
If he had 90 to his name then hed buy 90 worth of 
caviar Ms Hart said 
Loewe grew up in Vienna Austria in a musical family and came 
to the United States in his 20s His marriage of 26 years to the 
former Ernestine Zerline ended in divorce without children
