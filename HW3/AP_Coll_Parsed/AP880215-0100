Boy Scouts of America officials voted to 
allow women in leadership positions because fighting continual 
court challenges had become too costly and damaged the 
organizations image a spokesman said 
For 12 years the Boy Scouts fought challenges to its policy of 
providing only male leadership spokesman David Corti said Saturday 
Corti cited the great cost to the organization both in terms 
of money and in the perception of what we are as reasons for the 
reversal 
Im very happy that other women will have the opportunity 
said Phyllis Gibson a California woman who was a troop committee 
chairman and who was one of several who filed suit over the old 
policy 
Corti said the organization had won our court cases and 
probably would continue to do so 
The organizations National Executive Board voted for the change 
during a Thursday meeting in Washington DC said Barclay Bollas 
a spokesman for the Boy Scouts which is based here 
Our volunteer hierarchy felt boys of this age group should 
have the opportunity to be associated with male role models he 
said 
Women had been barred from becoming scoutmasters leading a Boy 
Scout troop as well as assistant scoutmasters varsity or 
assistant coaches or leaders of Webelos a program for the age 
group between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts 
Some officials were critical of the reversal 
Experts are saying men must spend more time nurturing and 
providing male role models for youth and Boy Scouting has provided 
this in spades said Ron Phillippo executive director of the 
Indianhead Council which includes eight counties in eastern 
Minnesota and four in western Wisconsin 
Many positions were open to women including the job of leading 
a Cub Scout troop officials said Of 11 million volunteers 
nationwide about 500000 are women Bollas said 
There was never a question of the ability of women It was 
just that the Boy Scouts felt there ought to be male role models 
for boys Phillippo said 
The value in scoutings former policy has been that it 
provided boys with a nurturant male role model said Judith 
Erickson a consultant for Minnesota councils and an associate 
professor at the University of Minnesotas Center for Youth 
Development and Research 
With this change in policy men must be serious about taking 
on the nurturant role in this and other organizations or this will 
be one more instance of women alone developing that type of close 
relationship Erickson said 
Ms Gibson of Goleta Calif said she doesnt believe there is 
any reason why a woman cant be in a scout leadership position 
I have enjoyed working with the boys Ive been a good 
motivator of boys I think its very important for boys to be 
around men and women she said 
Her son Chad also saw no reason for women to be banned from 
leadership 
Some of the older scoutmasters care but none of the kids 
care he said
