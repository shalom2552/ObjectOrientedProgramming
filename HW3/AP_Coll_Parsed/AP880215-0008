Twentysix states are now wheedling extra dollars from their 
taxpayers with lottery games helping senior citizens in 
Pennsylvania schools in Ohio and economic development in Iowa and 
Oregon 
Total sales exceeded 12 billion last year Eight states sell 1 
billion or more in lottery tickets a year keeping a third or more 
of that amount to support state programs Within the last year 
Florida Kansas Montana and South Dakota have joined the club and 
Wisconsin and Virginia will begin games this year 
Though most states report rising income from wagering some have 
to hustle to keep bettors interested 
Last week Pennsylvania scrapped a lotto game that had sold 22 
billion worth of tickets since 1982 and launched a Wild Card 
Lotto game Players in the old game picked six numbers out of 40 
but the new game has 48 choices 
That changes the odds of winning from one in 19 million to one 
in 61 million That in turn increases the chances of creating 
one of those humongous 30 million or 40 million jackpots that 
inspire frantic ticket sales 
Weve had so many people whove won a million or more it now 
takes a pot of 10 million to generate the interest that 5 million 
did once says Laurie KippKlecha a spokeswoman for the lottery 
in Michigan where on Sunday officials said someone was holding a 
17 million ticket after the latest drawing 
People like to spend a dollar to have a shot at the moon 
said Kathy Rem a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery 
Thats also the theory behind the new sixstate Lotto 
America game launched last week in Oregon Iowa Kansas 
Missouri Rhode Island West Virginia and the District of Columbia 
With more bettors to lose money the game can offer bigger prizes 
a minimum of 2 million 
Our motivation is to offer Oregonians a chance to play in 
games they could play in one of the big states said James Davey 
whose state lottery faces bigjackpot competition along the 
California border 
No one picked all seven numbers to win the jackpot in the first 
Lotto America drawing held Saturday night More than 2 million 
tickets were sold spokesman Brett Voorhees said in Des Moines 
Iowa 
Colorado legislators who have seen lottery sales slump from 
1369 million in the first year 198283 to as low as 1053 
million in fiscal 1985 are debating a bigjackpot lotto game this 
year 
Donald L Bean assistant director of the Ohio lottery credits 
the states Super Lotto game with helping build ticket sales 
from 100 million in the first year 197475 to 107 billion last 
year 
There are seven other states in the billiondollar club 
California Illinois Massachusetts Michigan New Jersey New York 
and Pennsylvania 
New York has the most lucrative games earning 6668 million on 
sales of 146 billion a 45 percent profit in the fiscal year 
ending March 31 1987 
New Jersey Michigan and Pennsylvania all extract more than 40 
percent from their games as well 
However Missouris 2yearold lottery has run into problems 
because the state constitutional amendment authorizing the games 
requires that 45 percent of the proceeds go to the state and that 
no more than 10 percent go to administration 
An independent audit commissioned by the Legislature concluded 
that the game would fail early in 1989 unless more money was 
offered as prizes and more money was available for administration 
An amendment reflecting those recommendations will be on the 
Missouri ballot later this year 
The Missouri lottery earned 80 million last year far less than 
the 250 million a year some legislators had forecast 
Even a successful operation such as the New York lottery 
contributes only 25 percent of the states general fund budget 
and there is no reason to believe that lotteries have been a 
substitute for tax increases 
New Yorks game began at the same time sales personal income 
and corporate taxes were rising in the freespending years of Gov 
Nelson Rockefeller Washington states lottery came with a package 
of tax increases in 1982 when the state was hardpressed for cash 
Dave Ellis spokesman for the Massachusetts lottery recalled 
that the lottery was promoted in 1971 as a way of avoiding a sales 
tax increase from 3 percent to 4 percent In 1975 the sales tax 
went up to 5 percent part of a program by newly elected Gov 
Michael Dukakis to eliminate a 600 million deficit 
Pennsylvanias receipts are earmarked for senior citizen 
programs such as tax subsidies and prescription drugs Despite 
projected growth of 11 percent next year revenues were lagging 
behind program requirements and Gov Robert P Casey has 
recommended returning some of the senior citizen programs to 
general funding 
Iowa decided not to depend on lottery profits for state 
operations Instead Iowa Plan proceeds go into onetime 
economic development programs such as grants to new or expanding 
businesses 
Oregon also directs its lottery profits 473 million last 
year to economic development 
Florida which began its lottery last month has a novel clause 
making things more difficult for unscrupulous prize winners It 
provides for prizes to be awarded to dependents if the winner is a 
childsupport deadbeat Already 70000 has been earmarked for 
dependents
