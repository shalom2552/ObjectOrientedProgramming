Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole 
was upbeat Monday on the eve of the nations first primary but he 
refused to predict flatly that he would notch a second straight win 
in Tuesdays New Hampshire balloting 
It feels good like it did in Iowa last Monday Dole said at 
the Windham Town Hall his last stop during a day of lastminute 
campaigning 
Flanked by Olympic gymnast Peter Vidmar former baseball 
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and his chief New Hampshire backer Sen 
Warren Rudman the Kansas senator dodged repeated questions about 
the outcome Tuesday 
I dont know how were going to do Thats up to you he 
said 
Speaking to several hundred people in the town hall Dole used 
the analogy that Monday as primary eve was akin to Christmas Eve 
Its one hour before the stores close You might as well take 
me Im the last one who came along today he said 
Dole trailed Bush here in the polls by a substantial margin 
before Dole won the Iowa caucuses last Monday Since then he has 
surged in the polls some of which gave him a small lead But 
others suggested his surge had abated leaving the race too close 
to call 
William Brock Doles campaign manager said that no matter what 
the outcome Bush was a loser in New Hampshire You cant have a 
campaign that collapses this fast and have any credibility he 
said 
While Bush bid to salvage New Hampshire Brock already was 
looking beyond 
As for the Bush campaigns claim to have a fire wall of 
support in Southern states which hold primaries and caucuses next 
month Brock said Its made of straw Straw burns pretty fast 
Returning to the theme that has dominated his effort Dole said 
he stands behind his 27years of public service and nearly 12000 
congressional votes a record Bush has said does not mean Dole has 
the ability to lead a country 
Dole chided Bush for blaming Congress for Americas deficit 
ailments 
Bush bashes Congress all week and then brings up 35 
congressmen to help him out in New Hampshire referring the 
people who came to the state Sunday to help spread Bushs message 
Im not someone whos been on the sidelines Im someone whos 
been in the arena Dole said 
Earlier in the day Dole and his wife Elizabeth autographed 
copies of their book The Doles Unlimited Partners while at 
the Fox Run Mall in Newington
