carrying Valentines Day gifts has died from a selfinflicted 
gunshot wound officials said today

shooting his wife twice in the head Friday died Sunday at Wilford 
Hall Air Force Medical Center said spokesman Tech Sgt Lowell Cook 
Janie Gallardo died shortly shortly after she was shot The 
couple had married in 1986 but had been separated since December 
Police reports say Gallardo assaulted his wife at school in late 
January and friends said she was also attacked another time near 
where she was killed 
Mrs Gallardo was carrying a box of Valentines candy two 
carnations and a small stuffed bear when she was killed 
Authorities speculated Gallardo may have thought someone had given 
them to her at Lowell Middle School 
It appears this is what enraged him It appears it was 
jealousy police homicide Detective John Campa said Saturday 
Mrs Gallardo did not run when her husband approached said Lulu 
Gamboa 17 who was walking with Mrs Gallardo 
Johnny said Janie where did you get those roses but Janie 
didnt say anything She just kept walking with her head down 
Miss Gamboa said Saturday Then he pulled out a gun I thought he 
was just playing because he was smiling but he shot her and we 
ran 
Gallardo then shot himself Campa said 
Miss Gamboa said the flowers and candy were given to numerous 
girls by male classmates at a school party Friday Mrs Gallardos 
brother Santos Arocha said his sister was allowed to marry at 13 
because she kept running away with Gallardo 
Arocha said she returned to her parents home in December after 
repeated abuse and because she wanted to return to school 
Arocha said the family had been unable to get a restraining 
order against Gallardo after Mrs Gallardo said she wanted a 
divorce 
Miss Gamboa said Mrs Gallardo was lonely 
She needed a lot of attention and love and she thought she 
would get it from him but she didnt Miss Gamboa said
