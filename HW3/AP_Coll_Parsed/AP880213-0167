Thousands of people grabbed for cheap beads 
and aluminum doubloons tossed from parade floats Saturday the 
opening day of an unusual fourday Mardi Gras weekend and 
thousands more queued up to board a giant aircraft carrier 
The glitziest the Krewe of Endymion boasted party pooch Spuds 
McKenzie accompanied by his corps of noncanine cuties the 
Spudettes as its grand marshal Spuds is the first animal to 
serve as grand marshal of Endymion which always invites a 
celebrity of some sort to lead off its fancy floats 
The beer company spokesdog rode low in a tall directors chair 
snout between paws nose pointing down and sporting a hangdog look 
Spuds float followed those of countrywestern charmer Dolly 
Parton who tossed doubloons Dynasty star Heather Locklear 
whose black sequined gown drew shouts from the crowd and soulful 
crooner Smokey Robinson 
In all nine parades were scheduled Saturday in New Orleans and 
its suburbs starting at noon and ending well after dark There 
will be parades every day through Fat Tuesday itself 
A line five deep and about four blocks long snaked from the USS 
Forrestal which docked at New Orleans to give its crew of 5000 a 
great weekend and to give civilians a look at the largest warship 
ever to come to the city 
Announcements over speakers from the ship and military police on 
shore patrol advised people in line that it would take those at the 
end three to four hours to get aboard 
For those unwilling to wait that long or uninterested in seeing 
the 1039footlong ship and its fighters attack bombers 
antisubmarine jets and electronic warfare planes there were the 
parades 
Mardi Gras is a state holiday and the federal governments 
celebration of Washingtons and Lincolns birthdays gave state 
workers Monday off as well 
All New Orleans parades have one thing in common the masked 
and costumed riders throw beads and plastic toys to the crowds 
which scream scramble and sometimes even scuffle for the trinkets 
Why 
Ive been here for 22 years and I still wonder what makes 
people go bananas over junk jewelry said Dr Fred Koenig a 
sociology professor at Tulane Its not even jewelry Junk 
Still the parade watchers will go to extremes for the plastic 
beads whistles dolls and so on and maybe even once in a while a 
doubloon a big aluminum coin designed for each parade group 
Even babies perched high atop step ladders are encouraged to beg 
for the trinkets as the crowds scream Throw me something 
mister 
Its having a chance to get something that is free that is 
not easy to get Koenig said That has some appeal You get 
this kind of gratification Prestige Like knowing somebody on a 
float 
Its competitiveness that is engendered there on the sides of 
the parade routes explained Dr Cameron Camp an assistant 
professor of psychology at the University of New Orleans You 
want to get it before someone else does
