Jack Kemp on Sunday said he was convinced 
that Republican presidential rival Bob Dole has a secret plan to 
raise taxes using a blueribbon study commission as the vehicle 
Dole said it wasnt true 
Kemp whose third place showing in polls has been threatened by 
Pat Robertson insisted he will beat the former TV evangelist in 
Tuesdays primary because the people of New Hampshire want a 
conservative who can reach out beyond just one segment of the 
population and win 
Electability is going to be an issue he said 
With the campaign heating up over the weekend Kemp raised the 
tax issue that is dear to the hearts of Granite State voters who 
often hear candidates take a noincrease pledge 
The New York congressman said having a bipartisan blueribbon 
commission recommend how to balance the budget was first suggested 
by Democratic Gov Mario Cuomo of New York but the idea went 
nowhere until Dole the Senate Republican leader slipped it 
into recent legislation 
I am convinced that Senator Dole has a secret plan to raise 
taxes on the American people Kemp said That would totally 
frustrate the Republican message that we are the lowtax party 
Kemp said Dole is going to allow the commission to do a study 
endorse it and say Hey this is not my tax increase This is the 
commissions tax increase Thats what he did on the Social 
Security Commission 
Dole speaking on ABCTVs This Week With David Brinkley 
said he doesnt want our six Republican members of the 
commission going in there with any thought of raising taxes 
We just had tax reform We took a lot of things away from a 
lot of people My view is we ought to give the American people a 
rest from increased taxes 
Dole said he already has chosen one commission member Sen Pete 
Domenici 
Asked why he waited until two days before New Hampshires 
primary to raise the issue Kemp said the campaign is only now 
turning to issues 
Speaking at a school later Kemp said he would ask former UN 
Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick to be his secretary of state if he is 
elected president
