To promote peace in Central America the 
United States should immediately lift its trade embargo against 
Nicaragua and stop blocking loans to the Sandinista government 
said Costa Ricas ambassador to this country 
Ambassador Guido Fernandez said Washingtons tactic of financing 
Contra rebels to force the leftist Sandinista government to allow 
democracy in Nicaragua has failed and that other means should be 
used to achieve that goal 
The Contras have received 300 million from the United States 
from both official and unofficial sources but they have made no 
gains Fernandez said in a speech Friday night at Rockhurst 
College 
The presidents of Nicaragua El Salvador Honduras Costa Rica 
and Guatemala signed a regional peace plan last August in Guatemala 
City 
It calls for an end to outside support for insurgencies in 
Central America and calls on the signatories to take specific steps 
to allow democracy to flourish in their countries 
The plan also calls for ceasefires amnesty for political 
prisoners and an end to the use of one countrys territory to 
launch attacks on a neighbor 
Fernandez said Washington should make concessions now that the 
US Congress has denied President Reagans request to send 
military aid to the Contras 
Now that we have withheld the stick why not use the carrot 
more Fernandez asked 
The Reagan administration has said it is following a twotrack 
policy toward Nicaragua by applying military and diplomatic 
pressure But Fernandez said he has only seen the use of military 
pressure by Washington 
Where is the other track of the twotrack policy he asked 
We would like to see it 
Fernandez said the United States should immediately lift its 
trade embargo against Nicaragua He said in comments after his 
address that Washington should stop blocking loans by the 
InterAmerican Development Bank to Nicaragua 
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias was awarded the 1987 Nobel 
Peace Prize for being the architect of the peace plan Many members 
of the US House said they voted against military aid to the 
Contras earlier this month to give Arias plan a chance to work 
Fernandez said that if the United States grants the concessions 
he mentioned they always could be reversed if the Sandinistas fail 
to live up to the plans provisions 
As part of the plan the Sandinistas and the Contras have 
initiated meetings to agree on a ceasefire Fernandez said that if 
a ceasefire is established in Nicaragua the United States should 
then negotiate directly with the Sandinistas to address US 
security concerns
