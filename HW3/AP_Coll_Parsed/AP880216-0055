When harbor pilot Wright Skinner Jr 
fell into Winyah Bay he became the fifth person to disappear in 
the bay on Feb 13 in the past 11 years 
I dont think Ill go fishing on Feb 13 next year said 
Dean Jordan whose father and cousin drowned in the bay on Feb 13 
1982 It is a little unusual because the day my father 
disappeared out there the winds were coming from the northwest and 
it was cold These were the same conditions when Mr Skinner went 
out 
Ive heard people call that area in Winyah Bay the Devils 
Triangle said Bobby Goude who helped search for Jordans father 
and cousin as a volunteer with the Winyah Rescue Squad 
Skinner a second generation harbor boat pilot had piloted the 
freighter Tropical Sky out of Winyah Bay and was returning to the 
trailing pilot boat when he apparently fell from a ladder leading 
down to the awaiting boat He landed in the mid40degree water at 
330 am Saturday 
Skinner has not been found Volunteers searched the area for 
four hours Monday until foul weather forced them to stop 
We will continue to search until the family says they want us 
to stop said Glenn Wilson chief of the Winyah Rescue Squad 
The Coast Guard has discontinued its search until further 
developments a spokesman said 
On Feb 13 1977 David Browder and John Stanley Gore went to 
search for a friend in their 10foot outboard Their boat was found 
overturned the following day while their friend was found safe in 
his stalled boat The bodies of Browder and Gore were found later 
in Charleston about 60 miles south of Georgetown 
On Feb 13 1982 Hubert Jordan Sr and his nephew David Jordan 
left port in their 18foot boat to go shad fishing When they 
didnt return after dark a relative Tom Swinnie Jr went in 
search of them Swinnie found the bow of the Jordan boat sticking 
out of the water 
David Jordans body was found 32 days later and Hubert Jordan 
Sr was found 50 days later both near Charleston Goude said 
There are other stories about the mysteries of the bay 
Two guys told me they were out on the bay one time and they 
saw three men on a 40foot shrimp boat out there and they turned 
their backs to the boat for a minute and when they turned around 
the boat and the men were gone and they never found it or the 
men Goude said My soninlaw got stuck out on the bay about 
two weeks ago and he said he was never going back because it was 
very dark and eerie
