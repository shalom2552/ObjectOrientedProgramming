A judge has ruled that suspected terrorist 
Fawaz Younis may be tried on charges he led the June 1985 hijacking 
of a Royal Jordanian airliner but not on charges of assaulting 
passengers and blowing up the jet 
US District Judge Barrington D Parker on Friday dismissed 
three charges against Younis but refused to dismiss six conspiracy 
and hijacking counts of the indictment 
Each of the three charges Parker dismissed carried potential 
20year sentences and fines of up to 100000 The hijacking 
charges still pending against Younis carry life sentences 
Parker ruled that the Aircraft Piracy Act of 1984 provided no 
jurisdiction for US authorities to prosecute Younis for the 
bombing of the ALIA jetliner The plane was blown up at Beirut 
International Airport after the passengers aboard the aircraft had 
been released 
The judge ruled however that the Justice Department did have 
jurisdiction to prosecute Younis on the six other charges of 
conspiracy and hijacking under the Hostage Taking Act also passed 
by Congress in 1984 as part of a legislative package to combat 
terrorism The hijacking happened June 11 
That law gives US authorities jurisdiction because three 
Americans were aboard the flight when it was stormed in Beirut by a 
group of armed men carrying assault rifles and submachine guns 
Parker said 
There is no dispute that the only nexus to the United States 
was the presence of several American nationals on board the 
flight Parker said The airplane was registered in Jordan 
flew the Jordanian flag and never landed on American soil or flew 
over American airspace 
The judge said the government didnt have jurisdiction to 
prosecute Younis on charges of placing a destructive device aboard 
the plane destroying the plane and assaulting the passengers 
because the ALIA flight had no connection whatsoever with United 
States territory 
The judge refused to dismiss the six conspiracy and hijacking 
counts of the indictment and upheld the use of Navy vessels that 
transported Younis following his arrest aboard an FBIchartered 
yacht last Sept 13 in the Mediterranean 
Younis who later told the FBI that Lebanaons Justice Minister 
Nabih Berri approved the hijacking was lured aboard the yacht by 
the prospect of making a drug deal authorities said
