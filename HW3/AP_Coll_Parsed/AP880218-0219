A computer whiz who authorities say went 
on a shooting rampage at his former company when his fantasies of 
romance with a coworker unraveled was charged Thursday with seven 
counts of murder 
Richard W Farley also was charged with three counts of 
attempted murder burglary and vandalism in Tuesdays shotgun 
massacre at the defense plant in neighboring Sunnyvale 
The 39yearold San Jose man a software development engineer 
fired two years ago from ESL Inc was ordered held without bail 
He is scheduled to enter a plea March 4 
Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Alan Nudelman said 
he would seek the death penalty 
Farley who was being held under a suicide watch at the county 
jail shot his way into the highsecurity installation and damaged 
the interior authorities said Three people were wounded by 
gunfire a fourth broke an arm trying to escape 
Among those recovering Thursday was ESL employee Laura Black a 
26yearold electrical engineer called the main target of the 
shootings 
Black says she refused to date Farley but he haunted her for 
four years with strange gifts and threatening letters and 
frequently followed her 
She obtained a temporary court order earlier this month for him 
to keep away from her and that order was made permanent Wednesday 
At ESLs offices Thursday several employees were led through 
the facility where the attack occurred The tours were part of 
the healing process and were recommended by counselors 
spokeswoman Edie Cartwright said 
Employees saw walls and floors riddled with bullet holes and 
dozens of computer terminals with screens shot out she said 
Numerous windows also were shattered Blood stains had been painted 
over and most rugs removed 
The extent of damage made it evident we were very lucky not to 
lose a whole lot more people Cartwright said The company plans 
to reopen its first floor Friday and its second floor scene of 
most of the damage on Monday 
Meanwhile investigators and colleagues reported that the burly 
Texas native apparently had no criminal record had been honorably 
discharged after 11 years in the US Navy was highly intelligent 
and performed satisfactorily at several topsecret defense jobs he 
had held in the Silicon Valley 
He is a parttime student in computer science at San Jose State 
University and was engaged to marry another computer student 
He was known as competent cheerful a pretty nice guy said 
Ron Edinger president of Sunnyvalebased Covalent Systems Corp 
his current employer 
But neighbors said Farley who lived in a dilapidated cottage 
with peeling paint was a loner who never said hello to anyone 
When he failed to get dates with Black he began living in a 
fantasy world said Blacks attorney Mary Bird Farley was fired 
in May 1986 from his 36000ayear job as a software development 
engineer after sending a letter threatening Blacks life said 
Jerry DeRuntz a company manager 
The attack said police Capt Al Scott and Lt Ruben Grijalva 
was Farleys way of showing he wouldnt tolerate being spurned by 
Black or laughed at by other ESL employees 
According to court records Black filed in seeking the court 
order Farley believed the two had taken vacations together and 
even tried to pass faked photographs as proof that the dates 
occurred Toward the end of the four years of alleged harassment 
he issued frequent warnings that something bad could occur 
It might not really occur to you how far Im willing to go to 
upset you if I decide thats what Im forced to he wrote in a 
letter to Black last July 
Then on Nov 13 he wrote This is going to escalate All 
because you think Im a joke and refuse to listen or to understand 
that Im gravely serious 
Black said fear of the consequences had caused her to endure the 
behavior obtaining an unlisted phone number and moving three 
times until she realized last month that Im at the end of my 
rope
