The recent spate of skittish economic 
indicators is raising concerns that the next president will take 
office without the tools to combat a recession even if an 
electionyear downturn can be avoided 
Thats because the federal budget deficit has grown so huge that 
the historical remedies for jolting an economy out of a recession 
lower taxes and more federal spending simply will not be 
available to the next president a growing number of analysts 
suggest 
In fact if anything the next occupant of the Oval Office will 
be under extreme pressure to press for higher taxes to reduce the 
budget deficit a tactic that would become all but impossible 
during an actual recession 
In 1981 when the last recession began the federal budget 
deficit stood at 78 billion By 1987 with the recovery from that 
recession entering its sixth year the shortfall was 148 billion 
after soaring to a record 221 billion in 1986 
The bloated budget deficits of the 1980s will make it that much 
harder for Ronald Reagans successor to cope with a recession say 
analysts troubled by recent reports showing a faltering economy and 
by last weeks Congressional Budget Office report that the deficit 
may hit 176 billion next year 
Economists and political leaders are coming down with a good 
case of the jitters 
The ability of the new president to use the discretionary 
parts of the budget particularly large tax cuts just arent 
there said David Jones senior economist for Aubrey G Lanston 
and Co 
And William Dunkelberg business school dean at Temple 
University suggests The chicken is coming home to roost On 
Oct 19 the stock market plunge he came looking for a place to 
roost but he didnt do it He was just observed to be a very large 
chicken 
So far the focus has been on whether the nation will avoid an 
electionyear recession that could spell disaster for Republican 
candidates 
But even if recession is escaped this year many analysts see 
one lurking just around the corner perhaps in 1989 That would 
present Reagans successor with painful policy choices from his 
very first day 
Under the GrammRudman deficitreduction act passed in 1985 and 
revised last year the budget deficit is supposed to be trimmed to 
136 billion next year Congress and the White House in a rare 
show of cooperation cut a deal in the aftermath of the stock crash 
spelling out broad outlines of a package to do just that 
White House budget Director James C Miller III says that the 
fiscal 1989 budget that the president submits to Congress next week 
will hit that 136 billion target on the nose even though it 
will be close 
But the CBO has cast serious doubt on that projection with its 
report last week that the federal deficit in fiscal 1989 which 
begins next Oct 1 would miss the GrammRudman target by 40 
billion even under terms of the White HouseCongress budget 
compromise 
If a recession hits all bets are off Both the White House and 
the CBO projections assume that growth will slow in 1988 not be 
negative A recession is usually defined as a decline in the gross 
national product for two consecutive quarters after adjustments 
for inflation 
Deficits usually expand in recessions because tax revenues are 
off at the same time demand for government benefits rises 
Nobel laureate Paul A Samuelson an economics professor at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that if the nation 
gets lucky and a recession doesnt arrive by 1989 it could present 
a rare chance to get the governments fiscal house in order 
It can be done in the early years of the next president 
Samuelson said 
But Samuelson and many other economists say major reductions in 
the deficit likely will require new taxes a course Reagan has 
steadfastly resisted throughout his term 
Of all the presidential candidates only Democrat Bruce Babbit 
advocates higher taxes to reduce the deficit even though all 13 
six Republicans and seven Democrats give reducing the deficit a 
top priority 
Economic consultant Pat Choate of TRW says that regardless of 
whom is elected barring a recession the next president will 
raise taxes 
The case for a tax increase is now much stronger than it was 
in 1984 when Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale 
braved much political derision to advocate one says Harvard 
economist Lawrence Summers 
Still Murray Weidenbaum economics professor at Washington 
University in St Louis and Reagans first chairman of the Council 
of Economic Advisers argues Given the softness of the economy 
it would be hard to find a worse time to talk about a significant 
tax increase 
Either way a painful recession or a major tax increase the 
economic policy options facing the next president will be limited 
and difficult 
The question is who would want to win control of the White 
House or the Congress this time Maybe thats why nobody is 
running jokes Temples Dunkelberg
