Indian troops screened 30000 men in a 
search for Tamil rebels and detained 131 Indias chief diplomat in 
Sri Lanka said Monday 
Ambassador Jyotindra Nath Dixit also said nine people believed 
to be rebels died in the operation 
He said some rebels likely evaded Indian forces during the sweep 
that began Thursday in the Batticaloa district about 140 miles 
northeast of Colombo 
Investigations are continuing and we believe that some Tamil 
rebels have escaped Batticaloa and moved north and west of the 
town he said 
He said similiar searches were under way in the Vavuniya 
district in the north and the Trincomalee district in the northeast 
Meanwhile a curfew imposed by Indian troops in and around 
Batticaloa was lifted for 12 hours Monday Shops and businesses 
were crowded as people emerged after a weekend restricted to their 
homes 
Tamil rebels are fighting for a separate nation in the northern 
and eastern portions of the island Tamils who are predominantly 
Hindus say they are face discrimination from the majority 
Sinhalese who are mostly Buddhist 
Thousands of Indian troops have been sent to the island to 
disarm the rebels and enforce a July pact aimed at ending the 
fouryear Tamil separatist war 
Tamil rebels have rejected the accord which was signed by India 
and Sri Lanka The pact grants limited autonomy to Tamildominated 
areas in the north and east 
On Friday Indian troops herded hundreds of men into a football 
stadium and conducted housetohouse searches in the eastern region 
The operation is aimed at finding members of the largest Tamil 
militia the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam A statement issued 
by the Tigers said no Tiger rebel had surrendered or been captured 
by the Indian troops 
Dixit wouldnt elaborate on the detentions but said up to 31 of 
the 131 held were hardcore members of the Tiger group 
An Indian helicopter sunk a boat in the Batticaloa lagoon during 
the operation and about nine people died he said 
We believe they were Tamil Tigers Our helicopters fired 
warning shots but the boat did not stop and we had to sink it he 
said 
Dixit said that between 45000 and 48000 Indian troops were in 
eastern and northern Sri Lanka He denied media reports that nearly 
100000 troops were deployed 
He said less than 2000 troops were involved in the searches in 
the east Sri Lankan officials say nearly 15000 Indian troops were 
involved 
It is in no way a major military offensive as the media both 
here and in India has made out Dixit said 
More than 360 Indian soldiers have died since Indian forces 
began battling the Tigers in October according to official figures 
Tamils make up 18 percent of the islands 16 million people
