Ethan Canin could be easy to hate Hes a Stanford 
University graduate a student at Harvard Medical School a budding 
literary star and he even has what used to be called matinee idol 
good looks 
At age 27 he has seen his short stories collected in a 
critically acclaimed new book The Emperor of the Air Houghton 
Mifflin Co 1595 
Canin has enough charm to deflect resentment He is modest and 
selfdeprecating almost worried about his near overnight success 
And at a time when trendy young writers such as Jay McInerney Tama 
Janowitz and Bret Easton Ellis are regularly bashed by literary 
critics Canin is different enough to resist comparison 
Were different kinds of writers said Canin during a recent 
interview at the Harvard Bookstore cafe I dont want to be 
moviestar famous I want to move people with my writing 
because Im so moved myself by good writing But its really easy 
to get swept up by the American publicity machine 
Every story Canin has written since age 19 has been published 
And his stories bear little resemblance to the world of the 
neohip New Yorkers chronicled by the new breed of writers There 
are no tales of bohemian artists in SoHo no cocainesnorting 
yuppies no alienated college students 
Instead Canin writes simple and spare stories in the voices of 
the elderly and middleaged as well as the young They are about 
people on the verge of change people confronted with decision and 
possible crisis They are people not unlike Canin facing a new and 
scary experience Canin will tell you that most of the varied 
characters in his stories are me 
His tales also hint at the dark side of life the inevitability 
and quiet anguish of aging the shadow of infidelity over a long 
marriage the emotional violence that often lurks within families 
But they end just short of despair His characters have hope 
however jaded 
The old man in We Are Nighttime Travelers has been married 
to his wife for years The two have grown so far apart that they 
live isolated secret lives separated by inches of bedsheet every 
night that might as well be miles Though he feels himself dying a 
little bit more each day surrounded by pills poor circulation and 
a faltering memory the old man is suddenly seized by a sense of 
renewal in the midst of decay He takes his wife on a romantic walk 
in middle of a cold night Later he kisses her for the first time 
in ages and has the feeling of a miracle 
Canin is a fourthyear medical student at Harvard and said that 
some of his insight into the elderly came from the older people he 
has examined 
You meet 40 people a day and you talk to them about their 
lives he said A lot of them are older If someone comes in 
under 55 youre so grateful to see young flesh 
Medicine keeps him in contact with people He has balanced a 
love and aptitude for science with writing since he started at 
Stanford He began as a physics major and took a creative writing 
class for an easy grade His teacher sent one of the stories he 
wrote in class included as Lies in his book to a literary 
quarterly in the Bay Area and it was accepted 
Its still the biggest thrill Ive ever received he said 
He switched to an English major at Stanford and then earned a 
masters degree in fine arts from the Iowa Writers Workshop He 
only wrote two stories in Iowa and said its a competitive place 
where I think some people really clam up 
As a result Canin applied to medical school after Iowa and was 
accepted at Harvard He wrote most of his stories in medical 
school many when he had to study for exams It was a kind of 
minirebellion he said 
But once again Canin is postponing science Though he has only 
several months left of medical school he is planning to take at 
least a year or two off He leaves for Mexico on April 1 and hopes 
to write a novel there 
Canin freely admits to a charmed life But he is equally candid 
about the peculiar fears that accompany a lifetime of good fortune 
My life has been very good he said If it were to turn 
bad maybe Id be the first person to go out and stab someone 
That ominous sentiment echoes Canins favorite story in his 
collection American Beauty in which a boy waits all summer to 
hear worldly wisdom dispensed by a troubled older brother leaving 
home 
If something ever goes wrong youre going to turn into a son 
of a bitch just like me the brother tells him Just like 
every guy in the world You dont know it yet because everythings 
all right so far You think youre a nice guy and everything hasnt 
really affected you But you cant get away from it Its in your 
blood
