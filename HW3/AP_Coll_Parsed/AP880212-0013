The son of a man who lived nearly 40 years in 
the United States and then died in a Yugoslav prison after being 
convicted of Nazi war crimes challenged US officials Friday to 
admit they wrongly extradited his father to a communist court 
Rad Artukovic in a 135page report submitted to the Justice 
Department said the department used fraudulent evidence to send 
his father Andrija Artukovic to face a sham trial in 
Yugoslavia two years ago 
The elder Artukovic died last month at age 88 while awaiting 
execution in a Yugoslav prison 
The only way the U S government could get him was through 
fraud Artukovic told a news conference before leaving for Los 
Angeles to join a federal courthouse vigil in honor of his late 
father 
He said his father has become a hero to people from his native 
Croatia now a part of Yugoslavia 
Andrija Artukovic who was a cabinet minister in the Nazi puppet 
state of Croatia was called Butcher of the Balkans by the 
Yugoslav government and accused of ordering the deaths of thousands 
of people During his trial he was described as as overseer of a 
grisly network of concentration camps 
Rad Artukovic 39 said his father was minister of the interior 
had no military responsibilities and ordered no deaths 
He said his father was not mentally competent to stand trial 
US officials had declared him senile and legally blind when he 
was extradited 
Tom Stewart spokesman for the Justice Departments criminal 
division said a copy of Artukovics report had been received by 
the Office of Special Investigations and was being reviewed by 
investigators who handle allegations of war crimes 
Hes done a marvelous job of defending his fathers 
reputation but the matter was dealt with in the courts Stewart 
said 
Artukovic said in the report that both his fathers extradition 
and the trial in Zagreb relied mainly on false testimony from Bajro 
Avdic a man who claimed to have been a military escort for his 
father 
The report said Avdic was not an escort and was not in the 
places he claimed to be when atrocities allegedly occurred It also 
claims he made up the killings attributed to Artukovic 
I ask the Justice Department to go into court and revoke the 
order they obtained through fraud Artukovic said accusing US 
officials of collusion with the communist government in Yugoslavia 
Artukovic said he hopes for a renunciation of the extradition to 
invalidate the Yugoslav trial 
Artukovic said he and two of his four sisters visited their 
father during his imprisonment in Yugoslavia but his mother Ana 
never saw her husband after he was extradited The family lives in 
Seal Beach Calif His father for many years had been a bookkeeper 
for a Los Angeles construction company 
The younger Artukovic a stock trader said he worked for two 
years to research the report on what he said was false evidence 
against his father and is sending copies to members of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
He said the Justice Department went along with whatever was 
given it by the Yugoslavian government but could not collect enough 
evidence to deport his father 
Artukovic said Yugoslavia accused his father of war crimes to 
neutralize him as a Croatian political leader He said most other 
members of the Croatian wartime cabinet were executed as war 
criminals but Allied officials found no evidence against him and he 
was allowed to live freely in Ireland and later the United States
