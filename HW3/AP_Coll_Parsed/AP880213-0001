PORTAUPRINCE Haiti AP Opposition leader Louis Dejoie was 
summoned to court next week for a hearing apparently related to his 
arrest on charges of inciting the public to revolt a Dejoie aide 
said Friday 
Aide Philippe Stevenson said Dejoies lawyer had mistakenly 
informed him that the hearing was Friday 
Stevenson said that Dejoie went to the Palace of Justice Friday 
morning but was informed by court officials that his hearing was 
not until Thursday 
I think it will be just to close his case since he was 
officially in provisional liberty Stevenson said 
Neither Dejoies lawyer Georges Leger nor Dejoie could be 
reached at their homes for comment 
Dejoie was arrested Jan 20 when he returned from a monthlong 
trip to the United States Canada and the West Indies During the 
trip he called for an economic boycott of Haiti to protest the 
aborted Nov 29 election and governmentrun elections Jan 17 
Dejoie was charged with inciting the public to riot and held for 
two days before his release 
The Nov 27 elections which were run by an independent 
Electoral Council were canceled after thugs killed 34 people and 
wounded 76 Witnesses said the army did not stop the violence and 
in some cases participated in it 
President Leslie Manigat won a Jan 17 election that was 
boycotted by the major candidates from the Nov 27 balloting 
Turnout was low and there was no secret ballot
