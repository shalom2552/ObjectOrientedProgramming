The US ambassador to Honduras on 
Tuesday denied American newspaper reports linking highranking 
Honduran military officers to Colombian cocaine traffickers 
I am the principal and highest official of the United States 
in Honduras and I totally disavow this situation that has appeared 
in the newspapers of my country Ambassador Everett Briggs said 
during a news conference in Tegucigalpa 
Briggs called the stories very imaginative and inventive 
President Jose Azcona Hoyo on Tuesday called the reports and 
effort to discredit his government and said he summoned Briggs on 
Monday to clarify the State Departments position on the matter 
The reports Azcona Hoyo said constitute a campaign to 
discredit the armed forces and my government which has taken a 
series of actions to combat the narcotraffickers 
The New York Times reported Feb 11 that high Honduran military 
officials had become involved with a powerful Hondurasbased 
narcotics trafficker Juan Ramon Matta in shipping cocaine to the 
United States The article cited Reagan administration officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
It added the Reagan administration was increasingly concerned 
about the Honduran armed forces connections with Colombias 
Medellin cartel producer of up to 80 percent of all the cocaine 
shipped to the United States 
On Sunday the Miami Herald reported Gen Humberto Regalado 
Hernandez the armed forces chief was suspected by US officials 
of protecting Colombian traffickers who used Honduras as a staging 
base for cocaine shipments from Colombia to the United States 
Briggs told reporters The attitude of General Regalado 
Hernandez has been honest and thanks to this we now wage a war 
without quarter against the international drug traffickers 
Briggs announced the United States at the invitation of 
Honduras will open a permanent office in Tegucigalpa next month to 
monitor drug flows
