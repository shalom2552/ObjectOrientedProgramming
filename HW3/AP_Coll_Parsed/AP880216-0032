A union leader and people in Managua 
complained that the governments new attempt to combat runaway 
inflation through currency and economic reforms has sent consumer 
prices soaring 
On Monday the government began trading one new cordoba for 
1000 old ones and raised salaries up to seven times their December 
level 
It also increased prices and ended government subsidies for a 
host of staples ranging from rice to beans milk sugar and 
cooking oil 
Last year inflation reached at least 1500 percent 
President Daniel Ortega announced the reforms in a broadcast 
address Sunday declaring that 10 new cordobas would buy one US 
dollar 
The new measures enforced by the government has left us in an 
even worse state than we were before said Nilo Salazar general 
secretary of a 30000 member federation of construction unions 
Nicaraguans have until Wednesday to exchange up to 10 million 
old cordobas at 2000 booths the government has set up across the 
nation Bank deposits are being adjusted automatically 
Under the reform package the governmentsubsidized price of 
gasoline jumped fivefold overnight to 15 new cordobas a gallon 
Gasoline is rationed at 17 gallons a month for private automobiles 
Salazar said people in his federation say they are worse off 
than before 
As an example he cited an assistant bricklayer whose monthly 
salary has risen from 191808 old cordobas to 79250 new ones 
A liter of milk which yesterday cost 2500 old cordobas now 
costs 660 new cordobas or 6600 old cordobas That is to say 
these prices have gone up more than 60 percent Salazar said 
The leftist Sandinista government has said the new measures will 
benefit wage earners in the long run by reducing inflation 
The revaluation is also an attempt to do away with the black 
market where a dollar had until Monday been worth up to 60000 
cordobas 
On the official market used to import machinery petroleum and 
other essential goods a dollar had cost 70 cordobas while it was 
worth 21000 cordobas on the parallel market 
A pound of beef which used to cost 25000 cordobas now costs 
35 cordobas That means that an assistant bricklayer has to work 
1093 hours to buy one pound of meat Salazar said 
An urban bus ride which the government wont subsidize anymore 
will now cost half a new cordoba against 10 old cordobas 
They those in the government think they can deceive 
people Felix Carnonel a 26yearold carpenter asked as he 
waited in line Monday outside a bank to change his old cordobas for 
new ones 
Angel Moreno 40 a mechanic complained that a housemaid will 
not be able to buy anything with the 500cordobas a month minimum 
salary that she gets paid when a pound of beef costs 35 cordobas 
a dozen eggs 25 cordobas and bread from 7 to 10 cordobas a pound 
Many of shopkeepers closed their doors Monday to adjust their 
prices and to change old cordobas for new ones 
But at Managuas huge Oriental Market a center of black market 
dealing in foreign currency it was business as usual Black 
market dealers and stallkeepers accepted both old and new cordobas 
Three days were allowed for the exchange during which only 
newspapers fuel medicine and medical services could be purchased 
with the old bills In addition the government established a 
temporary radio service to provide information on the currency 
exchange 
Ortega has blamed Nicaraguas economic problems on the 
6yearold war with USsupported Contra rebels and an American 
trade embargo According to the government the two factors have 
cost Nicaragua 38 billion in lost income
