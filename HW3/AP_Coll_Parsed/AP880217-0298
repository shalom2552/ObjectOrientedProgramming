Two former executives of BeechNut Nutritional 
Corp were found guilty Wednesday of selling appleflavored sugar 
water labeled as pure apple juice for babies a prosecutor said 
I think its an important victory for consumers said Thomas 
Roche executive assistant US attorney for the Eastern District 
of New York who prosecuted the case 
Our whole trial team believes that justice has been done he 
said 
The defendants former BeechNut president Neils L Hoyvald and 
a former vice president John F Lavery faced hundreds of 
violations of federal food and drug laws and conspiracy and mail 
fraud charges 
Lavery was convicted of all 448 counts in the indictment Roche 
said 
Hoyvald was found guilty on 351 counts all violations of 
federal food and drug law Roche said 
The jury couldnt agree on the remaining counts regarding 
Hoyvald he said 
The company which also was named in the November 1986 
indictments pleaded guilty last year 
The indictment charged that BeechNut shipped adulterated and 
misbranded juice made from phony concentrate throughout the United 
States and overseas from 1978 to 1983 
The juice labeled as 100 percent apple juice for babies was 
actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no 
apple juice the prosecution charged It was bottled at a BeechNut 
plant in Canajoharie in western New York state 
There has been no evidence that the juice caused any health 
problems the prosecution said 
This case was tried not in terms of being a health hazard 
Roche said Wednesday It was tried as a fraud case It was our 
view that the evidence in this case demonstrated a massive 
defrauding of BeechNuts consumers by BeechNut 
US District Court Judge Thomas C Platt did not fix a specific 
date for sentencing but it should be within six to eight weeks 
Roche said 
Roche said both Hoyvald and Lavery face substantial prison 
terms and substantial fines 
Conspiracy is punishable by five years in prison andor a 
10000 fine mail fraud is punishable by five years andor 1000 
food and drug law violations are punishable by three years andor 
10000 Roche said 
The two men were allowed to remain free on bail until 
sentencing the prosecutor said 
During closing arguments last Monday Roche said that evidence 
presented at the threemonth trial never showed Hoyvald and Lavery 
worrying about selling fake apple juice to babies but they 
were instead concerned about bad publicity and profits 
This is not the way we expect corporate executives in this 
country to operate he said 
Hoyvalds attorney Brendan Sullivan Jr argued that the 
government had fallen short by an enormous margin of proving 
his clients guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 
Sullivan charged that two key prosecution witnesses who work for 
BeechNut had lied when they testified that they had repeatedly 
warned executives that the concentrate was phony 
Steven Kimelman Laverys attorney said his client was a man 
who had nothing to gain by committing a crime Lavery was in 
charge of manufacturing at the Canajoharie plant 
The jury began deliberations last Tuesday It was not told that 
on Nov 13 three days before the trial began BeechNut pleaded 
guilty to 215 counts of violating federal food and drug charges and 
agreed to pay a 2 million fine 
In May BeechNut a subsidiary of Nestle Inc that is based in 
Fort Washington Pa settled a class action suit that was filed in 
federal court in Philadelphia in response to the New York City 
indictment 
In that case BeechNut agreed to set up a 5 million cash fund 
for consumers and to provide 25 million in BeechNut and 
affiliated products to retailers 
Also on the team prosecuting Hoyvald and Lavery were two 
attorneys from the US Justice Departments Office of Consumer 
Litigation John R Fleder director of that office and Kenneth L 
Jost a trial attorney
