This budget also reflects my belief that the health of all of 
our citizens must remain one of our top priorities 
I continue to urge enactment of an affordable selffinancing 
insurance program through Medicare to protect families from 
economic devastation caused by catastrophic illness 
To attack the scourge of AIDS I propose 2 billion for 
additional research education and treatment in 1989 a 38 
percent increase over the 1988 level and more than double the 
federal governments effort in 1987 This includes 13 billion in 
funding for the Public Health Service 
Building upon the nations preeminence in basic biomedical 
research I seek a 51 percent increase for nonAIDS research at 
the National Institutes of Health 
Our fight against drug abuse must continue as well as our 
efforts to protect the individual against crime 
For expanded law enforcement including efforts targeted at 
white collar crime organized crime terrorism and public 
corruption I propose 45 billion an increase of 6 percent over 
1988 
For drug law enforcement prevention and treatment programs I 
propose 39 billion in 1989 a 13 percent increase over the 1988 
level 
To relieve prison overcrowding and adequately house a growing 
inmate population I would provide 437 million more than double 
the 202 million devoted to federal prison construction in 1988 
Other areas of federal responsibility receive priority funding 
in this budget 
For the Federal Aviation Administration to continue its 
multiyear program to modernize the nations air traffic control 
systems I would provide 16 billion a 44 percent increase over 
the level of 1988 
To improve coordination of federal rural development programs 
and to redirect funding toward needy rural areas and program 
recipients I propose a rural development initiative to be 
coordinated by the secretary of agriculture 
To carry out the joint recommendations of the US and Canadian 
special envoys on acid rain I recommend total funding of 25 
billion for innovative clean coal technology demonstration projects 
over the period 1988 through 1992 
I also recommend an expansion of hazardous waste cleanup 
efforts with an increase in Superfund outlays of some 430 million 
in 1989 
To continue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR at 
the current rate of 50000 barrels per day I would provide 334 
million in 1989 Contingent upon the enactment of legislation 
authorizing the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserves NPR I would 
provide an additional 477 million to bring the fill rate up to 
100000 barrels per day and an additional 208 million to 
establish a separate 10 million barrel defense petroleum inventory 
to offset the disposition of the NPR 
To improve the speed and accuracy of tax processing and expand 
information services provided to taxpayers I would provide a 241 
million increase for the Internal Revenue Service These funds are 
designed to assure smooth implementation of the 1986 tax reforms
