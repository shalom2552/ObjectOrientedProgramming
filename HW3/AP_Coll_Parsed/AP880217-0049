Democrat Gary Hart who finished dead last 
in the primary he won in 1984 vowed to remain in the race despite 
his poor showing 
Were going to take this fight all the way across this nation 
into the South into the industrial Midwest and then were going 
to head West where I live Hart told a roomful of supporters 
after finishing at the bottom of the Democratic field in the New 
Hampshire primary 
In nearly complete returns the former Colorado senator had just 
4 percent of the vote but put the best face on it 
His showing he said was 500 percent better than Iowa 
where he won barely 1 percent of the vote in last weeks caucuses 
Hart dropped out of the race last May after questions surfaced 
about his relationship with model Donna Rice He returned to New 
Hampshire to reenter the race in December soared for a time in 
the polls then slumped to the back of the pack 
Four years ago Hart stunned the political establishment by 
upsetting frontrunner Walter Mondale in the New Hampshire primary 
gaining status as a credible candidate He said he never expected 
to do that well again this year 
We have just begun We are committed said Hart 
Earlier Hart said his faltering campaign had enough money to 
last until delegaterich Super Tuesday on March 8 
Ive always mentally prepared for a longterm gain not a 
breakthrough early on Hart said 
Campaign manager Sue Casey said the candidate had 400000 in 
his campaign treasury enough she said for three weeks of 
campaigning prior to the caucuses and primaries in the 20 Super 
Tuesday states 
I dont have to do what other candidates have to do Hart 
said during a campaign stop in Portland Maine before the votes 
were tallied Other candidates have to make a certain showing to 
get money and get support We have support in 50 states
