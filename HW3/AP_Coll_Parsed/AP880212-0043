An airline passenger with a beef over a 
bunless hamburger threw his plate and eating utensils at a flight 
attendant who was unable to placate him with a First Class roll an 
airline official said Friday 
Matthew Wallis 45 of New York City was booked for 
investigation of misdemeanor battery when American Airlines Flight 
209 from New York landed at 1015 pm Thursday at Los Angeles 
International Airport He was freed after posting bail of 500 
Wallis was one of 50 people aboard the DC10 who had ordered a 
special meal said Steve McGregor a spokesman for American based 
in Fort Worth Texas 
He had ordered a hamburger For some reason the hamburger did 
not have a bun with it He became somewhat unhappy with that fact 
Our people notified the lead flight attendant who did obtain a roll 
from the First Class section thinking that might placate him It 
did not McGregor said 
Wallis wife who flew with him on the New York to Los Angeles 
flight ordered the same special meal McGregor said 
Her hamburger in fact did have a bun McGregor said 
When the proffered roll failed to satisfy Wallis chief flight 
attendant Sue Roen of Los Angeles advised the captain of the 
problem He told her to read him that portion of the law 
outlining passenger misconduct McGregor said 
She did but that only appeared to make the passenger angrier 
McGregor said 
After using profanities he picked up his plate with the knife 
and fork still on it and threw it at her Ms Roen hitting her 
and narrowly missing a passenger with the flying knife said Los 
Angeles police Sgt Joe Arreola 
Ms Roen was uninjured and none of the passengers around Wallis 
was hurt Arreola said 
Wallis was placed under citizens arrest by Ms Roen after she 
was struck by the plate The captain contacted Los Angeles 
International Airport and asked that police stand by McGregor said 
Interference with a flight crew is a federal offense and we 
always prosecute That will be the case here too McGregor said 
McGregor was unsure how many passengers were aboard the flight 
and didnt know what the menu item was for passengers who had made 
no special requests
