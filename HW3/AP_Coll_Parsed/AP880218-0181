Boris Yeltsin the former Moscow Communist Party 
chief had been an outspoken supporter of Mikhail S Gorbachevs 
policy of greater openness but it led to his downfall when his 
criticism apparently went farther than the Soviet leader was 
willing to allow 
Yeltsin 57 was fired from the Moscow post Nov 11 after he 
criticized the partys style of leadership and the slow pace of 
Gorbachevs reform policies known as perestroika during a 
meeting of the policymaking Central Committee 
At the next Central Committee meeting which ended Thursday 
Yeltsin was dropped from his position as a candidate or nonvoting 
member of the Communist Partys ruling Politburo 
Yeltsin came to Moscow two years ago to take over the party 
organization that had been run by Viktor Grishin who was tainted 
by charges of corruption 
He raised topics that previous officials had left untouched He 
discussed the existence of special food stores for the Soviet 
elite he used mass transit and made unannounced visits to stores 
to see if the products were fresh 
But when Yeltsin was stripped of the job in November Gorbachev 
sharply criticized him for being overly ambitious In remarks that 
were printed in the official press Yeltsin said he was very 
guilty before the local party organization and Gorbachev 
Purported copies of his Oct 21 Central Committee speech that 
were circulated in Moscow and printed in some Western newspapers 
said he had even criticized the style of Gorbachevs wife Raisa 
He was hospitalized for heart problems after he lost the Moscow 
party leadership but since has returned to work in his new job as 
a deputy chairman of the State Construction Committee a position 
that carries the rank of a government minister 
Yeltsins ouster was seen by some Soviets and Western observers 
as a bad omen for the continuation of Gorbachevs policy of 
promoting a greater variety of opinions and more openness known by 
the Russian word glasnost 
Gorbachev acknowledged in a speech to writers and artists in 
January that the firing of Yeltsin was viewed by some 
intellectuals especially the young people as a blow to 
perestroika 
However he said that was the greatest delusion
