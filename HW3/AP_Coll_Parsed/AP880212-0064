The dollar soared in value Friday against most 
major currencies around the world after the government reported 
that the US trade deficit shrank for the second consecutive month 
in December 
Gold prices rose At Republic National Bank in New York the 
late bid for the precious metal was 44550 a troy ounce up 5 
from Thursday 
Weve got the excitement at last said James ONeill an 
economist and currency analyst for Marine Midland Bank Within 30 
seconds that the trade numbers came out there was an immediate 
adjustment upward 
The Commerce Department said Friday that the nations 
merchandise trade shortfall shrank to 122 billion in December 
from 132 billion in the previous month as exports jumped 42 
percent 
The December gap was the smallest since a 119 billion deficit 
in January 1987 and much lower than market analysts had predicted 
The dollar had risen about two yen and it was up around two 
cents against the British pound and the Swiss franc shortly after 
the trade report was released according to ONeill 
Later in the day though some profittaking and a reluctancy to 
hold dollar positions through the long Washingtons Birthday 
holiday weekend helped pushed the American currency off its highs 
traders said 
Even though the numbers are good nobody wants to go home 
sitting on dollars because all the old fears havent dissipated 
said ONeill those fears being that the trade deficit is still 
too big and that the dollar may have to fall further to get rid of 
it 
The dollars protracted decline in value began more than two 
years ago as a result of coordinated efforts by the United States 
and its main trading partners to improve the US trade picture and 
avoid protectionist legislation In in the past several weeks 
however the dollars value has been relatively stable 
Gary Dorsch senior money market analyst for LNS Financial Group 
Inc said the dollar also was helped Friday by a rise in interest 
rates in the credit markets He said dealers believe the Federal 
Reserve wont move to push rates lower in order to prevent the 
dollar from falling 
Rising interest rates tend to support a currency because they 
attract foreign investors eager to buy higheryielding US 
securities 
The dollar rose above 130 Japanese yen for the first time since 
midDecember trading at 13115 yen in London from 12995 earlier 
in Tokyo and up from 12903 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday Tokyo 
markets were closed for a national holiday
