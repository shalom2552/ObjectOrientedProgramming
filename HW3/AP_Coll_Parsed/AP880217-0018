President Reagan is remaining mum 
on the battle for the Republican presidential nomination as he 
heads back to Washington and his regular weekly meeting with Vice 
President George Bush 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan watched 
returns from the New Hampshire primary on television on Tuesday as 
he wound up a threeday vacation at his ranch in the Santa Ynez 
mountains north of here 
We wont have any comment Fitzwater said when asked about 
the New Hampshire voting Reagan has maintained a public stance of 
neutrality in the race for the nomination although he has 
repeatedly praised Bushs performance as vice president 
In response to a question Fitzwater said the Bush campaign 
facing stiff competition from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole had 
made no requests that the president step up his commendation of the 
vice president He said Reagan had not talked with Bush in recent 
days 
The two are scheduled to have lunch at the White House on 
Thursday as they do each week 
Also on Thursday the president will meet with bipartisan 
negotiators in Congress who worked out the 11 trillion budget 
compromise to be formally unveiled that day Fitzwater said Reagan 
would tell them that it is a remarkable budget that includes 
more money for AIDS research more money for housing and education 
but makes cuts in other areas that will allow us to meet the budget 
reduction and keep the deficit on a downward path 
Later Thursday the president will attend the swearing in of 
Judge Anthony Kennedy of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals as a 
member of the Supreme Court He nominated Kennedy after the Senate 
rejected his nomination of Robert Bork and his second nominee 
Judge Douglas Ginsburg withdrew in the face of reports of his 
marijuana use in earlier days 
On Friday the president will meet with West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl before leaving for Camp David to spend the weekend 
At his final meeting with reporters in Santa Barbara Fitzwater 
was asked about a speech in which Edward L Rowny the presidents 
disarmament adviser told a group of scientists in Boston that the 
Soviet Union is squandering time in arms talks and remains a 
brutal adversary 
I think Ambassador Rowny was just giving them a little prod 
that says Come on fellows lets get down to business here 
Fitzwater said We might not use those words but we share his 
concerns 
The spokesman also announced that the president was signing a 
bill by Sen Daniel K Inouye DHawaii rescinding an 8 million 
appropriation for schools for North African Jews in France Inouye 
was criticized after including the funds in a catchall 
appropriations bill
