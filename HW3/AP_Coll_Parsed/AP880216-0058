Three birth control organizations serving Colorado 
and Utah have won a temporary reprieve from new federal rules 
barring federally funded family planning clinics from advising 
pregnant women on abortion 
US District Judge Zita L Weinshienk granted a preliminary 
injunction Monday against the new rules scheduled to go into 
effect March 3 sought by Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood of 
Denver Planned Parenthood of Utah and the Boulder Colo Womens 
Health Clinic 
She said the order applies only to the three plaintiffs clinics 
The order just says the government cannot put these 
regulations into effect until we have a chance to hear it in a 
final hearing Weinshienk said in an interview 
The judge said she expected new hearing dates to be set within a 
week She said two similar cases will be heard in federal courts in 
Boston and New York this week 
The Denver suit claims the new regulations violate the Title X 
statute and the intent of Congress censure free speech rights at 
family planning clinics and violate the right of privacy of clinics 
and their patients 
The Department of Health and Human Services ruled that family 
planning programs receiving federal funds may not provide pregnant 
women with information on abortion or refer them to other sources 
even if they ask 
Reagan administration officials have said the rule is intended 
to make sure federal funds are not used to promote abortion even 
indirectly 
Weinshienk accused the Reagan administration of trying to use 
the regulations to circumvent Congress and amend legislation that 
set up Title X of the Public Health Service Act in 1970 to provide 
family planning clinics 
Legislative history includes a groundswell of support in 
Congress for womens rights to abortion even three years before the 
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion in 1974 she said 
She said the new regulations represented a 180degree switch 
from past interpretations of the statute by previous 
administrations 
Weinshienk said she based her decision on many US Supreme 
Court rulings that barred rules that dictated to doctors what 
they say to patients which is what the regulations attempted to 
do
