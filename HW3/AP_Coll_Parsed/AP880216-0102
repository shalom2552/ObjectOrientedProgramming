Iraq said Tuesday its warplanes made the 
25th air raid of the year on an Iranian tanker in the campaign to 
destroy Irans oil exports and end the 7yearold war 
Only a few of the raids have been confirmed by shipping agents 
salvage executives or other independent sources 
Iran said its aircraft made a damaging raid on a petrochemical 
plant near Basra Iraqs southern provincial capital The report by 
the official Islamic Republic News Agency gave no details and Iraq 
did not comment 
Another USescorted convoy of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers made 
its way down the Persian Gulf and a new Navy command ship the 
Coronado arrived in the gulf with four other American warships 
A dispatch from the official Iraq News Agency news agency said 
warplanes attacked a very large maritime target the standard 
phrase for a supertanker off the Iranian coast overnight 
It did not give an exact time for the raid and there was no 
independent verification 
The news agency quoted a military spokesman not identified as 
saying Iraq will continue to destroy naval targets that ferry 
Iranian crude because oil revenues are being used to finance the 
aggression against Iraq 
Iran uses its own and chartered tankers to move crude oil from 
the Kharg Island export terminal in the northern gulf which is a 
frequent target of Iraqi bombers to makeshift terminals in safer 
waters about 450 miles down the gulf 
Included in the USescorted convoy which left Kuwait on 
Sunday were the 294739ton Townsend an oil products carrier and 
the 46723ton liquefied gas tanker Gas Princess escorted by the 
missile frigate Reuben James 
It was the 12th this year and 36th since convoys began last 
July The United States has given US registration and American 
flags to 11 Kuwaiti tankers so the Navy can protect them 
The 17000ton Coronado will become flagship of the US Middle 
East Force in the gulf and the La Salle command ship in the region 
for many years will undergo a major overhaul at Yokosuka Japan 
The Coronado did similar duty in 198182 
In other changes the 18000ton helicopter carrier Okinawa is 
leaving and command will be transferred in late February to Rear 
Adm Anthony Less from Rear Adm Harold J Bernsen 
Other Navy arrivals the missile cruiser Wainwright and frigates 
Samuel B Roberts Simpson and Jack Williams replace departing 
ships but the Okinawa will not be replaced when it sails for 
California this week with the last four minesweeping helicopters 
US officials say withdrawal of the Okinawa which will cut the 
gulf force from 17 ships to 16 is part of a plan to reduce the 
cost of the escort operation now running at an estimated 25 
million a month 
Both Iran and Iraq reported raids on military and other 
installations at the southern end of the 730mile border war front 
The activity appeared connected to Iranian preparations for a 
longanticipated winter offensive 
Diplomatic sources in Kuwait say Iran has marshaled about 
300000 men in the southern area near Basra where it has mounted 
several major offensives since the war began in September 1980
