About 90 soldiers have been 
arrested and face possible death sentences stemming from a coup 
attempt in Bophuthatswana leaders of the tribal homeland said 
Friday 
Rebel soldiers staged the takeover bid Wednesday detaining 
homeland President Lucas Mangope and several top Cabinet officials 
for 15 hours before South African soldiers and police rushed to the 
homeland rescuing the leaders and restoring them to power 
At least three soldiers and two civilians died in the uprising 
Bophuthatswanas Minister of Justice G Godfrey Mothibe told a 
news conference that those arrested have been charged with high 
treason and if convicted could be sentenced to death He said the 
accused were to appear in court Monday 
All those arrested in the coup attempt have been described as 
young troops the most senior being a warrant officer 
During the coup rebel soldiers installed as head of state Rocky 
MalebaneMetsing leader of the opposition Progressive Peoples 
Party 
MalebaneMetsing escaped capture and his whereabouts remained 
unknown officials said Several unsubstantiated reports said he 
fled to nearby Botswana 
Warrant Officer MTF Phiri described by Mangope as one of the 
coup leaders was arrested Friday in Mmabatho capital of the 
nominally independent homeland officials said 
Bophuthatswana which has a population of 17 million spread 
over seven separate land blocks is one of 10 tribal homelands in 
South Africa About half of South Africas 26 million blacks live 
in the homelands none of which are recognized internationally 
Hennie Riekert the homelands defense minister said South 
African troops were to remain in Bophuthatswana but will not become 
a permanent presence 
Bophuthatswanas Foreign Minister Solomon Rathebe defended South 
Africas intervention 
The fact that the South African government was invited 
to assist in this drama is not anything new nor peculiar to 
Bophuthatswana Rathebe said But why South Africa one might 
ask Because she is the only country with whom Bophuthatswana 
enjoys diplomatic relations and has formal agreements 
Mangope described the mutual defense treaty between the homeland 
and South Africa as similar to the NATO agreement referring to 
the Atlantic military alliance He did not elaborate 
Asked about the causes of the coup Mangope said We granted 
people freedom perhaps to the extent of planning a thing like 
this 
The uprising began around 2 am Wednesday when rebel soldiers 
took Mangope and his top ministers from their homes to the national 
sports stadium 
On Wednesday evening South African soldiers and police stormed 
the stadium rescuing Mangope and his Cabinet 
South African President PW Botha and three of his Cabinet 
ministers flew to Mmabatho late Wednesday and met with Mangope the 
homelands only president since it was declared independent in 1977 
The South African government has said without producing 
evidence that the outlawed African National Congress may be linked 
to the coup 
The ANC based in Lusaka Zambia dismissed the claims and said 
South Africas actions showed that it maintains tight control over 
the homeland governments The group seeks to topple the Pretoria 
government 
The African National Congress and other antigovernment 
organizations consider the homelands part of an apartheid system 
designed to fragment the black majority and deny them political 
rights in South Africa
