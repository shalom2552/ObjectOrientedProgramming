Erik Hoglund a commercial artist brought 
a new style to the old art of making crystal in Sweden 30 years 
ago He did it with a potato 
He threw the potato into a pot of molten glass creating air 
bubbles But when glassblower Ruben Hjelm began to shape a piece at 
the end of his fivefootlong iron pipe he became enraged 
The crystal had bubbles in it and wasnt clear as good crystal 
should be Hjelm told Hoglund and stormed out 
The story goes that it took a bottle of shnapps to get Hjelm 
back and thus was created a style of crystal bowl and vase with 
bubbles frozen into the thick glass that has distinguished Sweden 
in the art of glassmaking 
The story of the potato and the air bubbles has entered local 
folklore in Smaland a southern province in Sweden known as the 
Crystal Kingdom 
Here glassblowing is a matter of pride tradition and economic 
survival 
Smaland which is too hilly rocky and forested for farming has 
lived from glassmaking for 100 years The industry has suffered 
some hard times but the marriage of artistry craftsmanship and 
export marketing has helped bring a revival 
Glassmaking employs some 2500 of Smalands 700000 people and 
earned 180 million in export income during the first 10 months of 
1987 
Tableware from the Orrefors and Kosta Boda companies appear in 
homes from Tokyo to Topeka and can sell for as much as 80 per 
glass One vase made by Orrefors in 1939 fetched 93000 at an 
auction this past November 
Glassblowing is a craft that generally takes 10 years to master 
Its a tricky art to breath a bubble of air into molten glass to 
give the edge just the right thickness twirl the fiery mass on the 
end of the pipe shape it cool it and cut it 
Its an art still passed on from father to son in Smaland But 
some aspects of the industry are changing as big companies and 
highpowered managers take over 
When I first started working here in 1959 this was a 
familyowned company said Gunnar Cyren one of eight designers 
for Orrefors 
All the youth in the village gathered in the blowing hall to 
keep warm by the ovens The door was always open Today there is a 
fence around the factory 
Half a million tourists a year come to the village of Orrefors 
which has a population of 1000 to see the glassworks 
Smaland once had as many as 60 glass factories with 4000 
workers Many companies closed during Swedens economic crisis of 
the 1970s and now only 20 remain 
Orrefors which began as an ironworks in 1726 and turned to 
glassmaking later was bought in 1971 by Incentive one of Swedens 
largest holding companies Kosta Boda was acquired by 
UppsalaEkeby another multicompany group 
Anxious to keep employment high Swedens Social Democratic 
government subsidized the industries and pressured the larger 
companies to buy up the smaller factories to keep them open 
They were afraid that the villages would die if the plants 
closed Orrefors president Goran Bernhoff said in an interview 
A 1982 devaluation of the Swedish krona together with the 
bigscale management and marketing of the new owners turned around 
the industry 
Now the numbers are climbing again About 40 young artists have 
opened studios to sell to tourists and other small markets says 
Gunnel Holmer curator of the Smaland Museum here in Vaxjo the 
regional capital 
The threat to the handblown glass industry today comes from new 
technologies said Mrs Holmer 
If we make good tableware here others soon copy it with 
machines and sell it much cheaper But the unique pieces the art 
glass thats something else she said 
Glassmaking is a symbiosis between the artist and the artisan 
You dont do any of the craftwork yourself says designer 
Erika Lagerbielke 
You make a sketch and try to explain to the glassblower what 
is to be done When you work well with someone one plus one 
sometimes adds up to three or four Sometimes you both end up 
surprised 
That was the way it was 30 years ago with Erik Hoglund Ruben 
Hjelm and the hot potato
