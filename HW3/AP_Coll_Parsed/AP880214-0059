Sequin and featherclad 
Brazilians turned out in grand style Sunday in the second day of 
Carnival revelries that featured the first of the top samba 
school parades 
In Rio de Janeiro temperatures soared into the high eighties 
The skies were sunny a marked contrast to weeks of almost constant 
rain that left at least 205 dead and 13000 homeless 
Revelers sunbathed on packed beaches and summoned forces for yet 
another allnight preLenten blowout 
Spirits appeared high undaunted by the recent tragic flooding 
the 16 percent monthly inflation and the countrys 113 billion 
foreign debt 
Sundays festivities featured the samba schools made up of 
dancers from neighborhood organizations who compete for dancing 
prizes 
The dancers mostly from poorer areas don skimpy rhinestone 
bikinis and elaborate feather headdresses and often dance for 16 
hours at a stretch 
Each year the schools spend millions of dollars on 
extravagant floats and sumptuous costumes 
This year many of the dances performed before a crowd of 
90000 will poke fun at foreign debt worries government 
corruption and poverty and racism in Carnivals version of 
streetside democracy 
The current champion Mangueira planned to dance to the theme 
100 Years Since Slavery Reality Or Illusion Slavery was 
abolished 100 years ago but racism still exists in Brazil 
The Padre Miguel school said it would to poke fun at economic 
worries and political chaos with the theme Kisses Kisses Bye 
Bye Brazil 
The first eight schools were to samba from 830 pm Sunday 
until about 1000 am Monday with the second group parading 
during the same hours from Monday to Tuesday 
Tickets for the event went for as much as 1000 a piece 
Carnival revelers with less to spend were satisfied with the 
allnight parties in exclusive nightclubs or out under the stars 
One of these was the Great Gay Ball where men dressed as 
women frolicked to samba rhythms 
Other openair parties took place along sprawling beachfront 
Atlantic Avenue and through ritzy Ipanema where thumping samba 
drums beat out rhythms as revelers in sequined costumes tinsel 
wigs masks and outrageous outfits danced the hours away 
Veja the nations largest circulation newsmagazine reported 
that for the first time in recent memory hotels and charter flights 
were not full 
AIDS and crime were blamed 
Brazil is second only to the United States in the number of AIDS 
cases with an estimated 5000 As of Jan 4 the Centers for 
Disease Control in Atlanta had received reports of 50265 Americans 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 28149 had died 
Brazil averages 16 murders a day and 2500 muggings and 1300 
rapes throughout the year The United State government recently 
threatened to class Brazil with El Salvador and Beirut for tourists 
because of its crime problem 
Despite the bad image police said in the first two days of 
Carnival festivities there were no festivalrelated deaths 
Health officials have also distributed tens of thousands of 
pamphlets warning against AIDS in three languages 
The AIDS virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers It is most 
often transmitted through sexual contact
