Pete du Pont struggling to keep his 
presidential candidacy alive in the final days before the New 
Hampshire primary lashed out Friday at fellow Republicans Bob Dole 
and Jack Kemp 
At a news conference in this snowbound city du Pont said 
What Bob Dole says seems to depend on what state hes in He 
also called Kemp a big spender 
With the departure of Alexander Haig from the Republican 
presidential race on Friday du Pont a former governor of 
Delaware ranks at the bottom of the fivecandidate field 
He conceded that to stay in the race after Tuesdays primary 
you have to do well You have to start beating somebody 
Du Pont had kind words for Haig a former secretary of state 
calling him a credit to this process and saying he brought a 
little spice to the debate 
But he had no kind words for anyone else 
Asked about his prospects du Pont said All of New 
Hampshires in flux now that the vice president is in a free fall 
Vice President George Bushs standing as the clear frontrunner 
among New Hampshire Republicans has eroded since his embarrassing 
thirdplace finish in the Iowa precinct caucuses on Monday 
Du Pont called the upcoming days the four most volatile of 
this campaign 
Focusing on Dole du Pont said I dont think you can go to 
Iowa and talk to farmers about how many dollars youve appropriated 
and then come to New Hampshire and avoid it 
He also said the Kansas senator had told Iowans that he would 
not pledge to oppose any tax increases and then came to New 
Hampshire and said he would veto a tax increase New Hampshire 
voters have a reputation for solid opposition to tax increases 
Du Pont also said that Dole had supported an import fee on 
foreign oil in Iowa but in New Hampshire he says hell veto it 
As for Kemp a congressman from New York du Pont said Hes a 
big spender In fact hes got a spending record in the Congress 
that is even more liberal than Pat Schroeder a Democratic 
congresswoman from Colorado or Paul Simon the Illinois senator 
who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination 
So I dont think on Tuesday the people of New Hampshire are 
going to fall for a snow job he said
