Bruce Babbitt says he has appropriated 
Hamlets dilemma To be or not to be 
The former Arizona governor was talking Wednesday about the 
possibility of ending his twoyear longshot presidential bid He 
said he would give his answer on Thursday but fellow Democratic 
candidate Jesse Jackson was already angling for his support if he 
should drop out 
Babbitt aides said privately that he was unlikely to endorse 
anyone at least for now 
Babbitt finished sixth of the seven major candidates in the 
Democratic New Hampshire primary edging Gary Hart by less than a 
thousand votes 
At a news conference before flying to Washington Babbitt told 
reporters I wont waste your time playing Hamlet for more than 
24 hours but Im sure going to do it for 24 hours He said he 
would make up his mind after speaking with advisers and his family 
In the closing days of the New Hampshire campaign Babbitt had 
appealed directly to voters to keep his campaign alive 
He talked Wednesday of the possibility of staying in the race to 
try to force debate among the Democratic contenders to make them 
face up to issues such as the federal budget deficit 
There will be a lot more debates he said and all you 
need to get into those debates and keep people honest and talk 
about the future is the price of a plane ticket Even Bruce Babbitt 
can raise the price of a plane ticket 
In an interview with CBSTV Wednesday Babbitt said There are 
some mornings you know I wake up in a Motel Six in some small 
town that I dont even know the name of Im on the phone that 
night to my kids obviously they miss me Ive been away too long 
Those are the down moments Then youre on the phone begging for 
money to meet the payroll and you say Why did I ever get into 
this 
Despite these regrets Babbitt retained the optimism that has 
driven his candidacy for two years 
There are worse things than losing he said The worst 
thing of all would be to lose having had nothing to say not having 
made a difference 
Babbitt said Gary Hart has urged him to stay in the race and 
that Jackson has asked for his support if he quits 
He and Jackson share a lot of experience from the 1960s 
Babbitt said including the civil rights movement But he said he 
told Jackson his request was premature 
Jesse its awfully early Babbitt quoted himself as saying 
Im not ready to make any decision 
Jackson who finished fourth in New Hampshire said Wednesday 
I hope I gain his support 
A Babbitt endorsement would obviously broaden the base of my 
campaign he said 
Babbitts New Hampshire showing was worse than his finish in the 
Iowa caucuses where he was fifth
