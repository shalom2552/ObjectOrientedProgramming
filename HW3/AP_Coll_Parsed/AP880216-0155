The superconducting super collider a 44 billion project 
sought by seven states was warmly supported by people attending 
public hearings in Texas and Michigan on Tuesday 
Contrary to some other areas in the United States who are 
reluctant to participate in this razor edge of technology and 
engage in what I call frontier spirit we in Texas believe in this 
project and this community is 100 percent behind it Gov Bill 
Clements said at a hearing in Waxahachie 
Only a few people among about 600 who attended a hearing at in 
Stockbridge Mich expressed reservations A union official 
described the mood at that session as a pep rally with young 
women handing out buttons extolling the SSC and banners and road 
signs declaring Michigan Is the Place To Be 
Arizona Colorado Illinois North Carolina and Tennessee also 
are semifinalists in the selection process New York dropped out 
because of strong local opposition at its proposed site 
Scientists say the super collider a huge atomsmasher 53 miles 
in circumference will provide new depth in high energy physics 
research 
When completed in 1996 the facility is expected to provide 
2500 jobs and an annual payroll of 270 million 
Clements spoke near the beginning of a public hearing on the 
environmental impact of the project on Ellis County south of 
Dallas 
Officials said 112 people had signed up to make comments during 
the 4hour hearing Tuesday afternoon A second hearing was 
scheduled for the evening 
Local and state officials asserted the project has overwhelming 
support in the area southeast of Lansing Mich 
People have questions but once those questions are answered 
people are overwhelmingly supportive said state Rep Debbie 
Stabenow a Democrat whose district would include part of the 
accelerator 
Tuesdays meeting was advertised by the US Department of 
Energy as an environmental scoping session to explain the 
project and allow citizens a chance to comment about issues which 
should be considered in preparing an environmental impact statement 
This is not a public referendum but it is important we 
understand how people feel said Brian Quirke a spokesman for 
the DOE 
Michigan needs it for economic diversification said Dick 
Howlett a member of the Stockbridge Village Council which 
unanimously supports the project 
He said some property owners who would be displaced are worried 
about compenstation but he said threequarters of the people who 
attended a recent council meeting supported the project 
However one man questioned whether the project had a military 
application 
I personally feel it will be a tool used for military uses 
said Steve Grose of Onondaga There is no doubt it would be used 
for military means
