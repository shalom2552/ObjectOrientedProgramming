A Texas Board of Education committee 
rejected a petition Friday to ban the paddling of students in 
public schools 
The 40 vote was recorded after Education Commissioner WN 
Kirby told the Committee for Students he did not believe the 
education board had the authority to outlaw corporal punishment 
Schools now set their own policies on paddling of students 
The petition was presented by Jimmy Dunne of Houston a former 
math teacher who is the founder and executive director of People 
Opposed to Paddling of Students Inc 
Dunne who said the sixyearold organization has 225 members 
told the committee his group considers paddling legalized child 
abuse
