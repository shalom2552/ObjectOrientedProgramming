You Can Dance Warner Bros Madonna 
 
Its got a good beat and you can dance to it Madonnas new 
album isnt really new but rather a collection of danceable hits 
remixed by club deejays masterful at that peculiar art of taking 
the artists work track by track and reconstructing it Most such 
remixes become 12inch dance singles and You Can Dance is 
basically a compilation of these 
The album includes Everybody Madonnas first single 
remixed into a long dance version and the 12inch disco mixes of 
Holiday Into the Groove Over and Over Physical 
Attraction and Wheres the Party The only new cut is 
Spotlight 
All are vintage Madonna light unburdened often hypnotically 
rhythmic pop music that you can indeed dance to and sometimes 
even listen to 
Into the Groove may be recognized by film buffs since it got 
additional notice in Madonnas film debut the 1985 Desperately 
Seeking Susan Her film career hasnt prospered since then but 
her recording career has not flagged 
Wheres the Party is from her most recent album True 
Blue released last year 
Madonna got her start in dance clubs and You Can Dance is 
an obvious tribute to the disco milieu where stamina and 
dependability are more valuable than intellect any day It might 
just be the only dance record youll ever need if you need only a 
beat not necessarily heart to get moving
