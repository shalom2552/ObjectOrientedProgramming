New Jersey election officials are 
hoping for strictly nonpartisan reasons that some of the 12 
remaining presidential candidates will drop out before the states 
June primary 
Many voting machines have room for only eight candidates on a 
line and as of Sunday five Republicans and seven Democrats were 
seeking their parties presidential nomination 
Things looked up on Friday when former Secretary of State 
Alexander M Haig Jr dropped out of the GOP race And other 
candidates may drop out after Tuesdays New Hampshire primary or 
after March 8 when voters will choose candidates in 20 states in 
the South and elsewhere 
However with the Garden State primary scheduled for June 7 
New Jersey clerks cant afford to sit around and wait said 
Atlantic County Clerk Lori Mooney 
When one machine is used at a polling site a lever is used to 
set it for one party or the other depending on the voters 
registration But many county clerks have already arranged to rent 
machines from other states to give each party its own machine 
In addition to the presidential candidates New Jersey officials 
must find space on their ballots for candidates in congressional 
primaries the Democratic nomination for a US Senate seat and 
candidates for delegates to the two major parties national 
conventions 
Fewer presidential candidates would make life easier for 
elections officials but Monmouth County Clerk Jane Clayton said 
shes not so sure that the slate will get smaller 
Its so easy for them to get matching federal funds today that 
theyre just not as encouraged to drop out she said 
Weve been through this problem since 1976 and its getting 
worse every four years said Union County Clerk Walter G Halpin 
Many other states do not have to worry about overcrowded ballots 
because their local and state elections are held later in the year 
or even in nonpresidential years 
That really eases the pressure on our ballot said Ron 
Michaelson director of the Ohio State Board of Elections 
In California ballots were crowded in 1984 with long lists of 
delegates for the Democratic National Convention This year voters 
will vote directly for presidential candidates and the number of 
delegates will be allocated in proportion to the popular vote 
We have only 10 columns on our machines Ms Clayton said 
Theres no way I could make up a ballot for both parties to go 
into one machine 
Even Atlantic County which has new computerized voting 
machines may be forced to look as far as Louisiana or Tennessee to 
rent additional equipment 
Ordinarily we can play with our ballot across the whole 
spectrum while other machines are usually confined by rows or 
columns Ms Mooney said But we have burned the midnight oil 
trying to compose the current ballot in a way that fits 
Additional voting machines may cost as much as 700 each in 
rental transportation and storage fees she said 
Halpin said he warned the secretary of states office last 
summer about the voting machine problem 
It will cost Union County 378000 to rent extra voting 
machines he estimated and I would have extra costs involved 
more tabulating more paper more sample ballots 
Clerks in several New Jersey counties are not worried about the 
upcoming primary however because they use voting machines that 
take computer cards 
Each voter gets a ballot card that they slide into the 
machine said Sussex County Clerk Helen Honey Ackerman 
They use a stylus in the confines of the voting booth to punch 
out various numbers that denote the candidates 
The director of the state election division Christine St John 
has warned county clerks to make preliminary arrangements to rent 
extra machines 
But after Tuesdays primary and the many Super Tuesday 
contests held March 8 I think youll see some candidates drop 
out she said 
Theres usually a lot of nervousness among county clerks at 
this point It will phase out
