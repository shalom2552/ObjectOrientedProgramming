Chatru Singh has given up praying to the 
rain gods He is tired of waiting for the misery of drought to 
end Hes thinking about leaving his farm and moving to a city like 
New Delhi 
His fields lie barren his cows and buffaloes are emaciated for 
lack of fodder and he has barely enough food for his family 
Four consecutive years of drought here in the state of Rajasthan 
have reduced his farm and hundreds of thousands of others to 
expanses of dust 
The drought has brought severe shortages of drinking water and 
fodder spiraling prices and fears of even worse times ahead if the 
rains fail again this year 
The lack of water and feed even has afflicted the states 
hundreds of thousands of camels the main mode of transportation 
for villagers scattered about the desert area 
Instead of growing lentils and wheat on his fiveacre farm 
Singh 46 now builds roads under a government relief program 
He considers that demeaning work but it provides him with 70 
cents a day to feed his wife and three children 
First the monsoons failed so our summer crop was destroyed 
and then we couldnt sow the winter crop because there was no 
moisture in the earth Singh said during a pause in his work on 
the road Even so he said he sowed some seeds but the birds ate 
them 
The Rajasthan state government is engaged in a massive relief 
program selling wheat at subsidized prices hiring people for 
construction work running camps for abandoned cattle and deepening 
wells But officials say that if it doesnt rain this summer the 
state cannot continue the program 
Rajasthan which forms a part of the vast Thar desert extending 
from western India to Pakistan traditionally is droughtprone The 
normal rainfall in the state known for its forts and palaces 
varies between 2 inches to 10 inches but last year the rains failed 
completely 
India was gripped by the centurys worst drought last year and 
16 of its 25 states were affected Those states asked the federal 
government in New Delhi for 46 billion in assistance but got only 
154 billion to divide up among them 
We will have a law and order problem this summer if it still 
doesnt rain said RN Meena the Ajmer districts top 
administrator 
Many animals will die No one can save them Only the rains 
can 
The district has an estimated 650000 cattle and they need 
fodder Meena said 
We bring in about 80 to 90 trucks from other states while the 
requirement is 400 trucks 
Water in Ajmer a city of 450000 people comes once every three 
days and people store it in every available receptacle Housewives 
save bathwater to use for their laundry 
Anasagar a huge artifical lake that provided drinking water to 
Ajmer is completely dry for the first time since it was created in 
the 12th century by the damming of the Luni River Residents say it 
is a curious sight to see people walk on the lake bed 
There is hardly any ground water here because the area is 
rocky said Ram Prashad Choudhary spokesman for the district He 
added that only very big farmers can afford the high cost of 
digging irrigation wells 
It costs about 7692 to dig a well because the drilling has to 
go down 700 feet to reach ground water Choudhary said 
Many poor people whose main occupation was raising cows and 
selling milk have abandoned the animals or sold them to butchers 
from Bombay at throwaway prices 
A count in 1983 came up with 49 million head of cattle in all of 
Rajasthan Indias secondlargest state with 39 million people 
Nobody knows how many are left In normal conditions each animal 
requires about 45 pounds of food a day 
The people of Rajasthan often face the dilemma of feeding 
themselves or their cattle 
Zakeera Banu a Moslem woman working on a state project to 
deepen a pond near Ajmer said I earn 9 rupees 70 cents a day 
I can either buy enough fodder for my two goats or vegetables for 
ourselves
