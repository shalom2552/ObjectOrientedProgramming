Although many employers realize they must 
bolster workers skills to stay competitive others are 
restructuring so employees often dont have to read write or think 
a change some educators call dumbing down 
Examples already abound from the automatic teller machines at 
banks to the electronic scanners at grocery checkouts to the 
pictures of hamburgers instead of digits on the cashregister 
buttons at fastfood outlets 
Supporters of these computerized innovations say they raise 
efficiency and cut overhead and retraining costs Critics agree 
such strategies can be helpful but often are based on the 
assumption that illiteracy in the work force is intractable 
There are jobs that will be dumbed down The problem is that 
someone has to service the computers that do the thinking said 
Eunice N Askov director of the Institute for the Study of Adult 
Literacy at Penn State University 
Another problem she said is that dumbing down decreases job 
security and will likely raise turnover rates at jobs in which 
promotions are unlikely 
Of course people want to be able to advance in their jobs 
she said Fastfood cashiering is a dumbdown job But employees 
cant advance so they eventually drop out 
Lawrence Mikulecky an Indiana University professor and literacy 
expert said some companies opt for the dumbingdown approach 
simply because of the retraining costs which can become 
prohibitive among workers who lack a highschool education 
To give you an idea of the magnitude it takes about 100 hours 
to move somebody up one grade level So from sixth grade to high 
school youre talking about a substantial amount of time he 
said 
Youre talking about hundreds and hundreds of hours of 
training Nobody takes those decisions lightly he said Its a 
major investment and companies have to take a look at whos worth 
investing in 
Many companies dispute the argument that replacing people with 
computers is a longrange danger to a skilled work force Large 
grocery chains for example have found automatic checkout systems 
that track inventory can alleviate timeconsuming clerk jobs and 
free workers for more challenging tasks such as managing 
delicatessen counters 
At the Great Atlantic amp Pacific Tea Co a leading chain with 
more than 1100 stores computerized checkouts have raised 
accuracy decreased customer waiting time and largely eliminated 
the need for clerks to stamp individual prices on items said 
company spokesman Michael Rourke 
Im not sure I would buy the premise that the technology is 
put in place to make decisions for the workers he said Im 
saying the technology were putting into effect is to improve 
efficiency and improve speed in making decisions and hopefully 
overcome some of the menial labor tasks 
On a broader scale such a strategy is part of the longrange 
plans of automaking giant General Motors Corp which once 
predicted it would go from one technical job for every 56 manual 
jobs to a 11 ratio by 1995 The company already is ahead of 
schedule 
One possible result of such a trend educators say is a 
polarization of the work force into a small number of highly 
trained professionals and a majority of employees largely unable to 
advance from relatively simple tasks 
When your choice is I cant hire somebody for under 12 an 
hour and its going to take me 500 hours of training then maybe 
you fire six of those people and have the one remaining directed by 
a computer Mikulecky said
