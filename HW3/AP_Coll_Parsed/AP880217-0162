Bob Dole on Wednesday portrayed George Bush 
and his aides as the hatchetmen of the GOP presidential campaign 
with all the axes in town swinging them in every state 
Dole promised to swing back if attacked again 
Youre seeing a mean George Bush You ought to take a look at 
some of the things they have been doing and saying Dole declared 
as he tried to rebound from his stinging defeat at Bushs hands in 
New Hampshire on Tuesday 
The Kansas senator said he had been too soft on Bush and had 
erred in the final days of the campaign by not responding to 
negative ads run by the vice presidents campaign 
Bush meanwhile denied he had done anything wrong 
Im not going to dwell on it you see I dont want to be 
drawn into something like that the vice president said to 
reporters People in New Hampshire like clean campaigns and they 
endorsed me overwhelmingly 
Sticking with his contention that the Bush ads were false Dole 
said he would not make the same mistake again He was careful to 
say that his aides would do the heavy lifting in the 
counterattacks which were already under way 
The problem with George Bush is that he hasnt got a record 
Dole campaign manager Bill Brock told reporters on the campaign 
plane from New Hampshire If somebody can tell me what he has 
done in the last seven years Ill buy somebody a steak 
Brock however said Dole officials would not distort the record 
as they said Bush had done We dont have to wallow in the mud 
with them to answer their charges he said 
Dole himself did try to stay away from a role in the 
counterattacking which is a sensitive subject in light of his 
reputation as once the toughest hatchetman of the GOP Asked if the 
new tactics threaten to revive that old image Dole said it is the 
Bush campaign that faces the image problem 
They have all the axes in town They seem to be swinging them 
in every state he said 
Dole pointed to an ad run by the Bush campaign in New Hampshire 
that accused him of straddling the issues of taxes an oil import 
fee and the mediumrange missile treaty And Brock reminded 
reporters that Bushs Iowa campaign manager had attacked Dole for 
cronyism and meanspiritedness and raised questions about 
his wifes blind trust 
Dole blamed part of his New Hampshire problem on the surge of 
expectations that built after he trounced Bush in the Iowa caucuses 
on Feb 8 
If expectations hadnt gotten so good it would have been a 
victory today Dole told reporters at the airport in Washington 
We didnt win But thats only one step along the way Were 
going to South Dakota and Minnesota 
Dole talked with reporters on the campaign plane as it flew from 
Manchester to Washington where Dole spent the day in meetings and 
in a Senate debate on campaign financing He was asked if he had 
been too soft on Bush 
Probably Dole replied 
Should he have fired back at Bush 
Yes thats my guess he said I think we sat on our hands 
for three days 
As for the dispute distorted ads Dole said at the Manchester 
airport Im not going to run from it Im not known for running 
from a fight 
I never said I was going to raise your taxes I didnt say I 
was advocating a 10abarrel import fee But thats what Bushs 
ads say and they are not true 
It was Brock who laid out the new tactics for the Dole campaign 
against possible future Bush attacks 
When he does it from now on were going to respond very very 
forcefully Brock said on the plane Were tired of it Were 
sick to the gills of this type of tactic 
George campaign on your own Brock lectured Bush via the 
media Earn it on your own Dont try to put somebody else down
