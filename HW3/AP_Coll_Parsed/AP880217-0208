Leaders of white supremacist groups 
gathered in 1983 to discuss poisoning the water supplies of New 
York and Washington DC and establishing an Aryan nation in the 
place of the present US government federal prosecutors charged 
Wednesday 
Assistant US Attorney Steve Snyder outlined the meeting in his 
opening statement to jurors hearing the trial of 14 men all linked 
with supremacist groups charged with conspiring to overthrow the 
government or kill federal officials 
Defense attorneys contended that the issue in the trial was 
freedom of speech One of the defendants presenting his own 
opening statement told the jury Youre about to get a great 
civics lesson 
A jury of 12 whites was selected for the trial Tuesday Because 
the trial is expected to last about three months Judge Morris S 
Arnold seated six alternate jurors rather than the usual two 
According to Snyder James Ellison who is in prison discussed 
a poisoning scheme in 1983 at an Aryan Nations convocation in 
Hayden Lake Idaho with Richard G Butler and Robert Miles 
Butler 69 of Hayden Lake and Miles 63 of Cohoctah Mich 
are among 10 defendants charged with seditious conspiracy which is 
conspiring to overthrow the government by force 
Butler is the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian 
Aryan Nations while Miles is a former Ku Klux Klan official 
convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school buses in Pontiac 
Mich 
Ellison whose name is on the governments list of witnesses is 
the former leader of an Arkansasbased militaristic supremacist 
group named The Covenant the Sword and the Arm of the Lord 
Officials raised the groups compound in 1985 and seized weapons 
and a 39gallon drum of sodium cyanide 
At the time of the 1983 meeting Ellison had more than 200 
pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession Snyder said 
At that same conclave several supremacist leaders discussed the 
idea of abolishing the US government and setting up an Aryan 
state Snyder said 
Louis Ray Beam Jr 41 of Houston a former Texas Klan leader 
and another of the defendants told the 1983 conference that the 
time had come for war Snyder said 
Snyder said Beam told his audience that the antiGod 
slithering homosexual dwelt in Washington DC and warned If 
you dont help me kill them youre going to have to beg for 
your childs life and the answer will be no 
Miles made a speech urging the use of robberies to finance 
supremacist activities Snyder said and six holdups during the 
next 18 months netted supremacists more than 4 million 
Ellison sent a paper around to be signed and when it came 
back signed by the leaders Ellision said All of us today 
entered into a conspiracy against the government of the United 
States Snyder said 
The prosecutor said no one disagreed with Ellisons statement 
and the meeting ended with the Nazi stiffarm hail victory 
salute 
Butlers attorney Everett D Hofmeister G Butler told the 
jury that freedom of speech was at stake in the trial and quoted 
the late US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes as saying 
freedom of speech includes freedom for the thought we hate 
The whole nation is watching you Hofmeister said What 
are the limits of freedom of speech Even the speech we hate It is 
an aweesome responsibility that you have 
Beam in his 90minute statement said that if the government 
will admit that the Constitution is dead and there is no freedom of 
speech Im guilty But if our Constitution still exists Im not 
guilty 
Beam said he was under the impression I could say whatever I 
wanted to say in this country In fact at one time I fought for 
that right Thats why Im here Some of my views are unpopular 
He also contended Snyders account was a good story but 
thats all it is and he knew nothing about any such conspiracy 
Snyder said the supremacists viewed whites as the people of God 
Jews as the spawn of Satan and blacks as subhuman The 
government was called ZOG for Zionist Occupation Government 
Two defendants William Wade and his son Ivan Ray Wade both of 
Smithville enlisted the aid of Ellisons group to murder a federal 
judge and an FBI agent who had been involved in the prosecution of 
people who harbored tax protestor Gordon Kahl Snyder said In 
1983 Kahl wanted in the killings of two federal marshals in North 
Dakota was killed in a shootout near Smithville at a home on land 
owned by William Wade 
The Wades wanted the CSA to take action against Judge H 
Franklin Waters the chief judge of the Western District of 
Arkansas and FBI agent Jack Knox to show the people that 
patriots cant be pushed around Snyder said 
A group headed out of the CSA compound on Dec 26 1983 to 
carry out the killings but backed out after a van in which four of 
them were riding went out of control on a snowy road and collided 
with a pickup truck Snyder said
