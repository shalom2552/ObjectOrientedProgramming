Police on Thursday detained and 
questioned two American women working in a resettlement camp then 
turned them over to the US Embassy officials said 
An Episcopal minister the Rev Donald Lewis of San Marino 
Calif identified the two as Kathleene Hoy and Mary Parmenter of 
Pasadena Calif He claimed their detention was a part of increased 
harassment of US ecumenical workers by Salvadoran authorities in 
recent months 
The two California women were detained for entering restricted 
areas without authorization said agent Orlando Ramirez of the 
Treasury Police whose jurisdiction includes investigations of 
customs and immigration violations 
Ramirez said they were apprehended at the Copapayo camp near 
Suchitoto about 25 miles northwest of San Salvador Guerrillas 
frequently carry out operations in the area 
He said the women along with seven Salvadorans were detained 
Thursday morning and brought to the capital The two US citizens 
were released into the custody of US Vice Consul Mark Schall 
after several hours of questioning he said 
US Embassy spokesman Jacob Gillespie said the Privacy Act 
prevented him from confirming the womens names or details of the 
incident But he agreed with the Treasury Police report that two 
American women were detained and later released 
Lewis chairman of a diocesan task force for Salvadoran 
resettlement said he was informed of the detention by telephone by 
a US Embassy official in San Salvador 
He said the military has been harassing Americans providing 
humanitarian assistance in El Salvador since about 20000 
Salvadoran refugees in Honduras decided to return to their homeland 
last fall 
Since then the government nervousness and harassment of 
ecumenical workers has increased Our concern is that this kind 
of caseworker harassment has happened to others who are strictly 
down there for humanitarian reasons he said 
Guerillas from five leftist groups have been fighting since 1980 
to overthrow the USbacked government
