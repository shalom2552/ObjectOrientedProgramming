A magazine said today that a 
document purportedly linking Austrian President Kurt Waldheim to 
the deportation of civilians to concentration camps during World 
War II was a fake and it apologized for publishing it 
Spiegel regrets that it presented this document to its 
readers as the proof of Waldheims involvement and not with the 
necessary distance the Der Spiegal news magazine said in its 
latest edition 
Der Spiegel said Bernhard Haas a document expert from 
Stuttgart concluded that the military telegram was in all 
likelihood a fake 
The telegram published Feb 8 allegedly linked Waldheim a 
former UN secretarygeneral to the deportation of more than 
4000 civilians while he served as an officer in the German army in 
Yugoslavia in 1942 
The West German magazine published the text of the telegram two 
weeks ago which it said for the first time will prove Austrian 
President Kurt Waldheims complicity in war crimes during World War 
II 
The document published said Very urgent Lieutenant Kurt 
Waldheim from the staff of General Stahl demands that 4224 
prisoners from Kozara most of them women and children and 
approximately 15 percent older men be sent on their way 3514 to 
Grubisino Polje and 730 to Zemun 
Both places were prison camps near Belgrade during World War II 
The Hamburgbased magazine said the document was discovered by 
Yugoslav military historian Dusan Plenca Spiegel has not said how 
it obtained the document 
Waldheim has consistently denied allegations he participated in 
war crimes while serving with the German army in the Balkans during 
the war 
After Der Spiegel published the document a Waldheim spokesman 
dismissed it as a probable fake 
A panel of historians assigned to study Waldheims past 
presented its report to the Austrian government last Monday and 
condemned the president for not objecting to atrocities it 
concluded he must have known about 
But the commission also said it found no proof Waldheim actually 
participated in war crimes It did not have access to the original 
telegram published in Der Spiegel 
Plenca never produced the original document The commission 
appealed unsuccessfully to the Yugoslav government to help it find 
the original 
Yugoslavia placed Waldheim on a list of suspected war criminals 
and asked for his extradition from Austria in 1947 but it never 
pursued the extradition request and never publicly explained why 
Yugoslavias Tanjug news agency said this week that the telegram 
was a forgery 
Tanjug said a Yugoslav commission formed of historians 
archivists and other experts came to the conclusion that the 
telegram is not an authentic document and that there exists a 
founded suspicion that it is a forgery
