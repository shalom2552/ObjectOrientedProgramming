Congressional leaders have assured the 
AFLCIO that its top legislative priority a trade bill with 
mandatory advance notices of plant closings or mass layoffs soon 
will be sent to President Reagan 
But the HouseSenate compromise that is to emerge probably will 
not include the strict trade imbalancereducing quotas written into 
the House version by Rep Richard Gephardt DMo says House 
Speaker Jim Wright 
Wright DTexas told the AFLCIOs executive council here 
Monday he had won assurances from Senate Democratic Leader Robert 
Byrd of West Virginia and other key negotiators that the 
HouseSenate compromise version will be nailed down by March 23 
and on the House floor for final action the following week 
After slightly different versions won easy passage in the House 
and Senate last year the trade measure became a dead letter when 
the stock market crashed Oct 19 because of fears it would trigger 
more panic selling by stock and bond traders 
White House chief of staff Howard Baker said last month that 
Reagan would veto either version as it now stands as being too 
protectionist The main targets of the administrations opposition 
have been the Gephardt language in the House version and a milder 
variation of it along with the mandatory 60day advance layoff 
notices in the Senate measure 
No question in my mind well pass a trade bill with 
enough votes to override a veto should that be necessary Wright 
said 
He said he met last week with Treasury Secretary James A Baker 
III and Reagans trade representative Clayton Yeutter expressing 
a willingness to compromise and promising them a vote by the end of 
the year on a separate USCanada free trade agreement wanted by 
Reagan 
Both House and Senate versions of the trade bill require 
countries with free access to US markets to provide the same 
level of access to American exports If a country does not remove 
its tariffs or quotas on US goods the president would have to 
impose the same measures on their exports to the United States or 
justify why he would not do so 
Wright said some version of the mandatory advance layoff notices 
will be in the final package despite intense opposition from 
business groups But he indicated the bill likely will drop the 
Gephardt language complaining there is too much of a fixation 
on it 
Gephardts measure a major theme of his presidential campaign 
would mandate retaliatory quotas or tariffs on some countries if 
they do not reduce their trade imbalances with the United States by 
10 percent a year over a fiveyear period 
Gephardts campaign message of threatening Koreans with stiff 
US tariffs was credited with reviving his campaign with a victory 
in last weeks Iowa caucuses 
Labor leaders said the Iowa results confirmed their belief that 
the nations record trade deficits and their contribution to the 
loss of more than 15 million manufacturing jobs this decade is a 
if not the dominant political issue 
The public will begin to demand more strongly that something 
effective be done about this decline of the American industrial 
base AFLCIO President Lane Kirkland said Monday Everything 
is going down with it 
Wright agreed saying wage scales in many countries with the 
biggest US trade imbalances are so far below those of the 
United States that they are acutally depressing wage scales and the 
standard of living in our country 
Nonetheless he predicted the HouseSenate conferees will agree 
on something in between Gephardts language and the Senate 
version which targets raising exports to countries with large 
trade surpluses rather than mandating specific trade imbalance 
reductions
