Sen Alfonse DAmato RNY still trying to 
steer his party to a candidate who could unseat Democratic Sen 
Daniel P Moynihan suggested Wednesday that if Rep Jack Kemp were 
to quit the GOP presidential race he should run for New York 
senator 
But Kemp spokeswoman Mary Brunette said Kemp has absolutely no 
intention of quitting the presidential race 
We are on the move and I think its kind of absurd for Sen 
DAmato to make that suggestion although we appreciate his 
support Ms Brunette added 
DAmatos suggestion first made late Tuesday on WCBS radio in 
New York came after Kemp scored a respectable third place in the 
New Hampshire priamry behind Vice President George Bush and Sen 
Bob Dole 
Former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont and extelevision evangelist 
Pat Robertson trailed 
I wouldnt be presumptuous to urge Jack to drop out of his 
presidential race DAmato said in an interview Wednesday I 
think he owes it to his party to himself to those who support 
him to compete for the presidency as long as he feels he has a 
chance to win 
But if he chooses to withdraw now or even after Super 
Tuesday he can make an outstanding candidate and I think a winning 
candidate for the US Senate 
DAmato said he had not discussed the idea with Kemp and that 
it had only just occurred to him 
Moynihan spokesman Matt James asked about DAmatos suggestion 
replied Youve got our poll results 
He was referring to a survey by Moynihans campaign taken the 
first week of February showing that if Kemp were to challenge 
Moynihan the incumbent would be favored by 60 percent of the 
voters statewide while Kemp would be the choice of 24 percent 
Eight hundred voters were questioned statewide James said
