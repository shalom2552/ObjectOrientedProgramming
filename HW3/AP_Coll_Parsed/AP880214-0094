office without the tools to combat a recession even if an 
electionyear downturn can be avoided

available to the next president a growing number of analysts 
suggest 
In fact if anything the next occupant of the Oval Office will

budget deficit a tactic that would become all but impossible 
during an actual recession

enough to delay their puberty because this may help protect them 
from breast cancer and other diseases later in life a researcher

first menstrual period or menarche later than usual Even after 
adolescence starts they may miss periods if they work out
