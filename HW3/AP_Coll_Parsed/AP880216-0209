Two nights a week Demetrius Mosley leaves his 
job at a toystore warehouse for a midtown Manhattan skyscraper 
where volunteers help him read newspaper ads and write simple 
sentences in a frayed notebook Three months ago he could barely 
write his name 
It takes a lot for a person to say I need help said 
Mosley 26 who is enrolled in a class run by Literacy Volunteers 
of New York City Inc A lot of people are scared to admit it 
At 630 pm the Gulf amp Western buildings 40thfloor cafeteria 
becomes a school where Mosley and about 70 other adults many of 
them poor and unable to read beyond the secondgrade level receive 
tutoring in the literacy demands of everyday life ranging from 
paying the rent to getting a drivers license 
Some seek help to read dimestore novelettes Others want to 
study the Bible or even opera librettos Literacy Volunteer 
officials said 
But for many the training is vital to their ability to work and 
earn a paycheck 
The students are taught by professionals including advertising 
executives accountants and teachers some from Manhattans swank 
private schools All are recruited by the Literacy Volunteers 
which holds classes in 10 sites citywide 
When adults dont know how to read and write they dont have 
much faith in themselves said Eli Zal executive director of the 
Literacy Volunteers He said the group gets a large part of its 
budget from corporate donors 
Because of television publicity and a growing awareness of the 
nations illiteracy problem the Literacy Volunteers office has 
been inundated not only with applications from prospective 
students but tutors as well There is a 10month waiting list for 
student spaces and for the first time a waiting list for tutors 
who receive a special training course before teaching a class 
These people really want to learn Thats what is exciting to 
me said Ann Heininger a 30yearold volunteer tutor who works 
for Coopers amp Lybrand a large public accounting firm 
She began tutoring about three years ago and it has since become 
a regular part of her routine she said During that time she has 
helped students learn to scan helpwanted ads and write notes to 
creditors about disputed bills She recalled helping one student 
read a gambling handbook 
I try to get my students to help each other she said One 
of the biggest things is to get their confidence up and that 
strategy helps 
Mosley one of a halfdozen students taught by Ms Heininger in 
her current class said he decided to seek help partly because of 
his job at a Toys R Us warehouse where he needed to recognize the 
names of games and other toys 
When I first came to this class I couldnt read Picking up a 
book was like a disease he said But now no problem When you 
come to realize you can do this its great 
Nizam Ali a 28yearold student in Ms Heiningers class said 
he sought help after watching a TV ad about illiteracy 10 months 
ago Unable to read Ali only had been able to get errand jobs or 
other work that didnt require filling out a job application he 
said Now he is reading simple romantic novels and wants a 
highschool diploma 
Since I started here its done a lot for me he said I 
know how to do things Write a check read a sign The teachers 
here they help you a lot They have a lot of patience 
Zal estimated nearly 70 percent of Literacy Volunteer students 
are employed and most want improved skills to help them at work 
Although that is important Zal said he is concerned about what he 
called a preoccupation with workplace literacy that also could be 
harmful 
Its one thing to learn how to read names on a paintchip 
chart for your job he said But where does that person go to 
learn to read a bedtime story to his children If workplace 
literacy is where it stops it is rather frightening
