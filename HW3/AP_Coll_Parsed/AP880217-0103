Mayor Dick Crawford easily defeated his 
challenger in the Republican primary for City Hall and will face a 
state senator in the April general election 
Weve been looking to get this out of the way so we can get to 
the main event Crawford said after his victory Tuesday night 
over businessman Tom Quinn 
Crawford 54 who waged a minimal primary campaign won the 
Republican nomination with 14952 votes or 61 percent according 
to unofficial results from all 188 precincts Quinn received 38 
percent of the vote or 9327 votes 
Crawfords opponent in the April 5 race is Democratic state Sen 
Rodger Randle who contended Quinns relatively strong showing 
against an incumbent indicates voters are not pleased with Crawford 
Quinn only recently joined the GOP to stop Crawford from running 
unopposed Randle also noted Quinn a sign company president had 
defeated Democratic Mayor Terry Young in the 1986 primary 
It certainly would have to be a disappointment to Mr Crawford 
to have Mr Quinn run so well against him Randle said 
Randle won the Democratic nomination with 57 percent of the 
ballots cast or 20507 votes Former Tulsa water and sewer 
Commissioner Patty Eaton came in second with 13361 votes or 37 
percent 
The other four candidates in the Democratic primary received a 
little more than 5 percent of the votes cast 
Tuesdays election had a record turnout with more than 70000 
of the 250000 registered voters casting ballots Tulsa County 
Election Board Secretary Scott Orbison said 
Randle 44 has been a member of the Oklahoma Legislature for 17 
years and served as Senate president pro tempore He lost his first 
race for mayor in 1978 to Republican Jim Inhofe now a congressman 
from Oklahomas 1st District
