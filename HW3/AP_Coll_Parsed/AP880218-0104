Some of the nations biggest corporations have 
endorsed a socalled workplace bill of rights pledging to actively 
educate workers about AIDS and protect the rights of employees who 
have the deadly disease 
The pledge unveiled Wednesday by the Citizens Commission on AIDS 
for New York City and Northern New Jersey says people with AIDS or 
exposed to the suspected AIDS virus are entitled to the same 
rights and opportunities as people with other serious or 
lifethreatening illnesses 
The pledge endorsed by 30 employers adds that they do not pose 
a risk of transmission of the virus to coworkers through ordinary 
workplace contact 
Requiring workers or job applicants take blood tests for the 
virus is specifically rejected as is divulging medical information 
about an employee it says 
But it said Employers should provide employees with 
sensitive accurate and uptodate education about risk reduction 
in their personal lives 
IBM was the first company to endorse the principles John 
Zucotti cochairman of the commission said at a news conference 
Others are ATampT Time Inc Johnson amp Johnson WarnerLambert 
ITT Dow Jones Chemical Bank the city of New York the teachers 
unions of New York City and Newark NJ United Jersey Banks 
Shubert Organization Times Mirror Co Atlantic Industries Ms 
Atlantic Sassy and US News and World Report magazines 
Rubenstein Associates Rockefeller Brothers Fund the National 
Urban League the Girl Scouts Salvation Army Red Cross of Greater 
New York New Jersey A Philip Randolph Institute Lambda Legal 
Defense and Education Fund Fund for the City of New York Wildcat 
Services and Archie Comics 
Those companies that have subscribed to these principles have 
been very courageous said Thomas Stoddard executive director of 
the Lambda fund They have been willing to take the heat because 
they understand the gravity of the problem We will continue to 
have the problem of stigmatization until all companies subscribe to 
these principles 
The 15member commission was established in July and funded by 
17 local foundations Zucotti said its mission is to marshal 
information and mobilize effort to improve care for AIDS sufferers 
promote prevention and education about the fatal affliction and 
address its social impact 
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer There is no known cure 
It is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
The federal Centers for Disease Control estimates that AIDS will 
strike 270000 Americans and kill 179000 by the end of 1991 The 
CDC already has received reports of more than 28000 deaths of 
people with AIDS
