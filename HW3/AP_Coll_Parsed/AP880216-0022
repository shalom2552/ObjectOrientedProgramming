Vice President George Bush forecast a win 
but Sen Bob Dole also expressed optimism Monday as the GOP 
presidential field sprinted for the finish line in a tight New 
Hampshire primary race Democrat Michael Dukakis said his expected 
win might be smaller than predicted 
I sense a rising tide said Bush The vice president threw 
all the resources he could muster into his bid to arrest Doles 
weeklong surge campaigning side by side and in a hurriedly taped 
television commercial with Barry Goldwater patron saint of 
conservatives 
It feels good like it did in Iowa last Monday countered 
Dole hoping to ride to victory on the strength of the momentum 
spawned by last weeks caucus win 
One candidate after another posted hopeful predictions of a 
surprise when New Hampshire voters render their verdict in the 
nations leadoff primary on Tuesday 
I dont know where all those political pundits are today but 
they ran for cover four years ago and theyre likely to run for 
cover tomorrow said former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont back in 
the pack in the GOP race 
Rep Jack Kemp his GOP candidacy on the line held out the hope 
of a secondplace finish that would confound the pollsters Im 
going to finish in a good competitive third or higher he said 
Democratic Sen Paul Simon also facing tough times if he 
falters said he was sure hed defeat Rep Richard Gephardt for 
second place Referring to Dukakis commanding lead in the polls 
he said I think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming 
tomorrow 
Fellow Democrat Bruce Babbitt far off the pace in the polls 
said Im anticipating a strong showing and a surprise but I 
cant put a number on it 
Former television evangelist Pat Robertson bid to deal with a 
tempest that arose over his claim that the Soviet Union has 
offensive nulcear missiles in Cuba The Reagan administration 
denied the claim but the GOP hopeful said The least we can do 
is remove those nuclear missiles 
Democrat Dukakis lead seemed secure to judge by the polls but 
he and his aides worried that they would be held to an impossible 
standard when the New Hampshire results are analyzed Thus he 
noted that his rivals have been attacking him regularly adding 
I assume thats going to take its toll 
No two polls were alike But they all showed a Republican race 
as close as the Democratic campaign was not 
First results from New Hampshire as usual came from the 
mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch where midnight voters favored 
Bush and Gephardt who claimed 11 and 4 votes respectively 
In the rest of the Republican field Dole had 6 Kemp 5 du Pont 
2 Alexander Haig 2 Robertson 1 The only Democrat besides 
Gephardt to get any votes was Simon who received 3 
Dukakis governor in nextdoor Massachusetts held a commanding 
lead among the Democrats with support of roughly 40 percent of the 
voters Gephardt and Simon who finished a close onetwo in Iowas 
caucuses last week are in a duel for second place Jesse Jackson 
Babbitt Gary Hart and Sen Albert Gore Jr are far afield in the 
polls 
Among the Republicans the surveys said that Dole has wiped out 
all of Bushs oncecommanding lead in the eight days since the 
Kansas senator won the Iowa caucuses and the vice president slipped 
to third place behind Pat Robertson Robertson Kemp and former du 
Pont are in a close fight for third place in the same surveys 
What the polls couldnt say was whether Doles momentum would 
carry him past a struggling Bush to first place 
The vice president had his retooled informal campaign style on 
display He went from one restaurant to another to greet voters at 
breakfast time ordering pancakes at one stop sipping coffee at a 
second and eating an Egg McMuffin during a visit to a McDonalds 
Bush attacked Doles call for a spending freeze as a copout 
that avoids making tough decisions and forecast a victory for 
himself in the leadoff primary 
Im going to win tomorrow Believe me he told a cheering 
crowd at Daniel Webster Colleger in Nashua 
In the fiveminute television commercial Goldwater called Bush 
the best qualified candidate of my lifetime other than me 
George Addressing the voters Bush said Who can you most 
trust to continue the Reagan Revolution 
Dole and his senior aides sounded confident I think its that 
close said Dole who said a victory in New Hampshire might carry 
him all the way to the GOP nomination 
Im always skeptical until the polls close he said but 
then added that he had followed his pollsters example and slept 
well last night 
William Brock Doles campaign manager said that no matter what 
the outcome Bush was a loser in New Hampshire You cant have a 
campaign that collapses this fast and have any credibility he 
said 
While Bush bid to salvage New Hampshire Brock already was 
looking beyond 
As for the Bush campaigns claim to have a firewall of 
support in Southern states which hold primaries and caucuses next 
month Brock said Its made of straw Straw burns pretty fast 
But Bushs campaign manager maintained that Doles New Hampshire 
surge had stalled Bush was a little behind but hes moving up 
said Lee Atwater 
Among the Democrats Simon urged New Hampshires voters to 
assert their independence from Dukakis There is a difference 
between me and Michael Dukakis a difference in experience a 
difference in commitment he said 
Dukakis had a speech prepared taking aim at Gephardt and Simon 
but he chose not to deliver it when he faced a high school audience 
in Claremont 
This campaign is not about the past it is about creating a 
future in which all of you can work he said 
Gephardt made no attack on Dukakis or Simon in the final full 
day of campaigning Stand with me tomorrow and we will reform 
America he said
