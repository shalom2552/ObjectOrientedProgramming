Emory University researchers have fitted monkeys 
with contact lenses in a study that they hope could yield new ways 
to treat babies born with cataracts and other vision disabilities 
The study at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center 
involves a pediatric ophthalmologist a primate behavioral 
psychologist neuroscientists and several dozen monkeys 
In the experiments rhesus monkeys undergo lensremoval surgery 
to simulate the operation performed on a newborn with cataracts 
the cloudiness of the eye lens that often plagues older adults 
Such cataract surgery is not new In most cases when a lens is 
removed the patient can be fitted with corrective contact lenses 
or glasses 
But the surgery poses special problems in young children 
because humans are born without fully developed vision systems the 
eyes and the brain must learn to work together If deprived of 
normal visual stimulation such as by cataracts special cells 
needed for vision fail to mature properly 
Cataract surgery must be performed in children at a very early 
age Even so doctors have had poor results in trying to stimulate 
development Despite corrective lenses the best most children have 
achieved has been 2040 vision 
In the experiment the researchers remove a healthy lens from 
one eye of each monkey They fit them with contact lenses made at 
the centers lab and try various treatment to prompt successful 
vision development 
Hopefully well be able to relate these results to the human 
child Dr Ronald Boothe the ophthalmologist and behaviorist who 
heads the twoyearold study said in an interview Friday 
In both monkeys and man patients with one good eye and one bad 
one will rely on the good eye 
If a childs left to his own devices hell ignore it the 
damaged eye said Dr Howard Eggers a pediatric ophthalmologist 
from New Yorks Columbia University who is working with the Yerkes 
primate researchers We want to force usage of the cataract eye 
To force use of the weaker eye a child can be fitted with a 
patch over the good eye Monkeys dont like to wear eye patches so 
the Yerkes monkeys are fitted with a black contact lens over their 
good eye 
In either case stimulating proper vision development in the bad 
eye is not as simple as just blocking the good one Eggers said If 
worn too little a patch will leave the patient relying on the good 
eye too long and vision in the patched eye will deteriorate 
Doctors are unsure how long the patches or black lenses should 
be worn to give each eye the proper visual stimulation Eggers 
said We dont know the best method and we obviously cannot 
experiment with children 
To solve the problem Yerkes researchers are using different 
lens routines on different monkeys Some wear a black contact lens 
all the time some never do and others wear it for different 
intervals 
Researchers check the studys remaining 20 monkeys every two 
hours to make sure they havent lost their lenses They have a 
great ability to rub contact lenses out Eggers said Lost lenses 
are quickly replaced 
Researchers test the monkeys vision in part by showing them 
patterns on a video screen and rewarding them with banana pellets 
when they recognize the proper pattern thus proving their vision 
is working 
After the lens trials the monkeys are killed so researchers can 
examine their brains and the development of their optical nerve 
systems Boothe said
