The Last Emperor garnered nine Academy 
Award nominations but this years list of Oscar contenders is a 
diverse lot of epics comedies and dramas hardly a onepicture 
sweep 
The comedyromance Broadcast News received seven nominations 
Wednesday and the wartime drama Empire of the Sun showed up 
six times in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences list 
The six nominations also received by the psychothriller Fatal 
Attraction and the offbeat love yarn Moonstruck reflect the 
Academys orientation toward commercial hits rather than domination 
by artsy movies 
Fatal Attraction took in 129 million at the box office and 
The Untouchables with four nominations brought in 76 million 
At the same time the good showing by The Last Emperor 
indicates the academy looks beyond what succeeds commercially said 
the films director Bernardo Bertolucci 
Its fantastic to have with me all my people my collaborators 
who shared with me the Chinese adventure said Bertolucci who 
noted his associates on the movie the life story of Chinas last 
emperor were a mixture of Italians Britons and Chinese 
What I think is a great satisfaction for me today is to see 
that Hollywood has given this recognition The nomination 
already tells that there was for Hollywood a great proof of 
nonchauvinism None of these nominated for best director is 
from Hollywood he said today on ABCTVs Good Morning 
America 
Best director nominee Adrian Lyne said he finds it tough to 
believe people really liked his movie Fatal Attraction 
I got up early fearing and trembling watching the live thing 
on CNN Lyne said When the movie came up in category after 
category I was bouncing up and down with my wife and the dog 
Broadcast News set in a television news bureau brought 
nominations for stars William Hurt Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks 
Im on my way out to see the movie again to see what they are 
talking about Brooks said 
James Brooks was nominated for producing the picture and for 
writing it but startlingly not for directing it 
The nominations for Empire of the Sun also didnt include 
one in the directing category for Steven Spielberg who has yet to 
win an Oscar for best director despite being the top moneymaking 
director of all time 
His film also was not among the best picture nominees 
Broadcast News Fatal Attraction Hope and Glory The 
Last Emperor and Moonstruck 
Twotime winners Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep were nominated 
for their roles as Depressionera lowlifers in Ironweed 
Best actor nominees also included Michael Douglas for Wall 
Street Hurt Broadcast News Marcello Mastroianni Dark 
Eyes and Robin Williams Good Morning Vietnam 
It made me not only proud of our film Wall Street but it 
reminded me of what a wonderful part Oliver Stone created said 
Douglas

Moonstruck Glenn Close Fatal Attraction Miss Hunter

Sean Connery who never was nominated in his many appearances as 
James Bond placed among the nominees for supporting actor for his
