This town of cobblestone streets and 
sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in India but 
millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their 
sins in its holy lake 
Pushkar is a place revered by Hindus and even by some foreigners 
who seek out its tranquility 
Its beginnings lie with Lord Brahma the creator of the universe 
in Hindu mythology Hindu texts have it that when Brahma was 
seeking a place for a holy ceremony he chose Pushkar 
He dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the 
desert to form a lake according to the texts that date from the 
8th century BC 
In these modern times as the sun rises Hindu pilgrims chant 
mantras and take a dip in Pushkar Lake believing all their sins 
will be washed away by the holy waters 
Europeans and Americans often are seen by the lake sharing the 
religious experience They feed grain to pigeons and sweets to 
longtailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the towns 
400 temples where ascetics Hindu monks and other holy men gather 
Pushkar a town of 9000 people is an oasis of tranquility far 
removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of Bombay New 
Delhi and Calcutta 
The blazing sun soaks into everything 
It was the sacred month of Kartik signifying the onset of 
winter when Lord Brahma is said to have dropped his lotus blossom 
Brahma foremost in the Hindu trinity of supreme gods had been 
looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony 
But his wife Savitri could not attend the ritual Angered she 
decreed that henceforth Brahma would be worshiped at only one place 
Pushkar became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of 
creation while millions of shrines were erected across India to 
Lord Shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like Kali and 
Durga who are often depicted as firespitting images carrying heads 
of evil men they had slain in battle 
But this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for 
the Hindus almost equal in importance to Benaras the eternal 
city Hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in 
Benaras 
Pilgrims come by the thousands to Pushkar 250 miles southwest 
of New Delhi to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of 
Brahmas majestic rite every year on Kartik Poornima the full moon 
night in the month of November 
Shielded by Nag Pahar or Serpent Mountain Pushkar has Indias 
and perhaps the worlds only temple to Brahma 
The town centers on the lake where there are several steps for 
bathing Signs warn foreigners not to wear shorts and other 
revealing clothes not to smoke drink near the lake or take 
photographs not to kiss embrace or indulge in other irreverent 
acts 
The steps called ghats are controlled by vigilant and 
aggressive brahmin priests who preside over religious ceremonies 
armed with horoscopes They watch every pilgrim approaching the 
lake and pounce on potential clients 
Each visit is recorded in their bulky clothcovered books A 
priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited 
Pushkar by referring to the dogeared notebooks 
Displeasing a priest can be unpleasant He will pronounce curses 
on ones entire family naming all the grandfather father and 
sons 
From the lake the steps lead up to the main street a favorite 
shopping center with the tourists The shops are stacked with 
exotic handicrafts peasant skirts and other clothes native to this 
part of India Velvet shirts and pajamas musts for lowbudget 
travelers hang in vibrant displays
