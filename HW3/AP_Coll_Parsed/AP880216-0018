The roof of the Washington Public Power 
Supply System No 2 nuclear reactor building cracked because of a 
malfunctioning fan but the mishap posed no danger officials said 
Monday night 
During a safety check of a circuit breaker Sunday night an air 
supply fan came on inadvertently and within a few minutes had built 
enough pressure to pop about 200 bolts that fasten an interlocking 
grid of steel panels in the roof of the building said Lee Oxsen 
operations director The bolts are about a quarterinch in diameter 
and an inch long he said 
No loud noise accompanied the fracture and it was discovered 
only as a reactor operator noticed the bolts on the floor while 
making a routine hourly inspection less than an hour later Oxsen 
said 
The pressure pushed the roof upward a few inches and when it 
fell back into place there were two seams in a rough Tshape one 
seam about 40 feet long and the other about 25 feet long said 
Barbara Mathews of WPPSS 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified immediately but 
there was no danger to workers or the public Ms Mathews said The 
plant was shut down at the time 
Oxsen said repairs could cost more than 1 million a couple 
of hundred thousand dollars a day for up to a week 
These roof panels I should add are designed to do exactly 
what they did he said These bolts are designed to pop when 
internal pressure reaches a specified level 
He explained that the pressure system and roof design are 
intended to protect the reactor from inward collapse in the event 
of a tornado or other severe storm 
He said an initial inspection indicated the only repairs needed 
would be to bolt the panels back into place and restore the foam 
tar and gravel on top of the roof which is about 120 feet off the 
ground 
The whole building is pressurized he said 
Oxsen said similar accidents had occurred at other reactors 
including the Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey about 19 or 20 years 
ago He said he did not know the cost of repairs in that or other 
instances 
The plant at the nearby Hanford nuclear reservation was shut 
down Saturday to fix leaks in two condenser tubes in the cooling 
system so it was an opportune time to do some other 
maintenance Oxsen said 
The NRC had directed WPPSS to check for potential problems in 
some Westinghouse circuit breakers including the one linked to the 
errant supply fan he said Both exhaust fans and the other supply 
fan were turned off at the time he said 
Oxsen said the control panel initially failed to show the supply 
fan had come on and an automatic cutoff system apparently failed 
as well
