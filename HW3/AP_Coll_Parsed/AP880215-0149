His music will be immortal said comedian Red Skelton his 
friend of 45 years The world will always hear him speak feel 
his emotions for he has only put on a shroud that makes him

this exclusive desert community and was also friends with area 
residents Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra 
Im very sad He was an adorable person under his very rough 
manner said French actress Leslie Caron who starred in 
Gigi I was quite fond of him He looked a bit like Edward G 
Robinson playing a gangster When I first met him he put me off 
Then I realized he was a softy 
He was a very sentimental and gentle man He was always happy 
and never gloomy Skelton added 
The LernerLoewe team enchanted audiences with tunes from such 
classic musicals as Gigi Camelot My Fair Lady and 
Brigadoon 
Some of the other songs the team produced were Almost Like 
Being in Love I Could Have Danced All Night and Get Me to 
the Church on Time 
Actordancer Gene Kelly who starred in the film version of 
Brigadoon praised Loewe as a fine musician who did great 
things 
I was lucky to do Brigadoon because it was a singers 
picture Kelly recalled But Frederick helped make it a 
dancers picture with my small Irish tenor called upon to sing all 
those wonderful songs He was a fantastic man an eccentric and an 
adventurer 
Loewe known as Fritz died Sunday at 151 pm at Desert

unit which are used each year to buy Christmas gifts and toys for 
sick children there he added 
Lerner died in 1986 His widow actress Liz Robertson was in 
Manchester England on Monday performing in a revival of My Fair 
Lady 
He was just a wonderful generous man who wrote the most 
extraordinary beautiful music Im pleased to be performing My 
Fair Lady on stage in Manchester so that I can celebrate his life 
by singing his music tonight she said 
Lerner and Loewes partnership began with a onenight flop in 
Detroit in 1942 They parted bitterly after Camelot their last 
Broadway hit in 1960 After a 1973 reunion for the Broadway 
production of Gigi originally written in 1958 as a movie they 
remained friends

country prospecting for gold herding cattle delivering mail on 
horseback and teaching riding at a New Hampshire resort As a 
bantamweight boxer in Brooklyn he won eight of nine professional 
bouts 
In 1931 Loewe married Ernestine Zerline whom he divorced after 
26 years together with no children He has no survivors 
He began his collaboration with Lerner after accepting an offer 
from a stock company in Detroit to adapt a farce The Patsy 
Lerners fascination with the Scottish writer Sir James Barrie 
led to the teams first hit show Brigadoon and their first 
hit song Almost Like Being in Love in 1947

reunited in 1951 to produce Paint Your Wagon 
Next came My Fair Lady in 1956 a musical adaptation of

novella by Colette in 1958 It was the first film to win nine 
Academy Awards including an Oscar to Loewe as cowriter of the 
title song
