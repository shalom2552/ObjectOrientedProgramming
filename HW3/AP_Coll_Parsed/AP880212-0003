The parents of a student slain when he 
apparently stumbled onto a reputed Mexican drug lords party have 
dropped a 2 billion lawsuit against the man saying a trial would 
rekindle painful memories 
Alberto Radelat a dental student and journalist John Walker 
were tortured and killed in February 1985 in Guadalajara Mexico 
and authorities there said they believed the men were executed 
because they were mistaken for drug agents 
On Jan 29 Dr Felipe Radelat and his wife Ana filed a wrong 
death action against reputed drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero whom 
authorities have blamed for the deaths 
The younger Radelat and Walker had apparently entered a 
restaurant where Quintero was holding an afterhours party 
A witness told the Radelats that their son and Walker were 
stabbed with icepicks and switchblades before they were dumped in a 
crude grave outside Guadalajara where their bodies were found in 
June 1985 
On Thursday Radelat said he dropped the suit a week after 
filing it because it would revive memories the family had tried to 
put behind them 
My wife had settled down and this brought it all up again 
he said We dont want any more bad memories It was a sad 
experience I hope no one ever has to go through it 
Quintero was among nine people indicted Jan 6 by federal 
officials in Los Angeles in connection with the deaths of Drug 
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot 
who were killed about a week after Radelat and Walker were slain 
Quintero is in a Mexican jail charged with all four deaths US 
authorities indicted him and the others in Camarenas death in an 
effort to bring them to justice if Mexican authorities dont 
prosecute them 
Radelat said he filed the lawsuit because the US government 
had not indicted Quintero in the other deaths 
We were disappointed they US officials indicted Quintero 
just for the drug agent not the other Americans Radelat said 
We wanted to do this suit not so much for the money but just to 
do justice for our son
