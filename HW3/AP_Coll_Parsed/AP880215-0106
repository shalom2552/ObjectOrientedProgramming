Tourists are harassing the uniformed sentries at 
St James Palace according to lawmakers who want the government 
to do something about it 
I have quite often seen pretty girls putting their arms around 
soldiers on duty outside St James Palace while their friends 
take teasing photographs of them said legislator Harry Greenway 
Sometimes they hug the soldiers round the neck and squeeze 
them It requires the patience of Job for a young soldier not to 
react angrily or indeed in any other way he said 
At Buckingham Palace Queen Elizabeth IIs official residence 
sentries were moved in the 1960s from outside the gates to the 
courtyard where the public cannot enter after one soldier got fed 
up with being pestered and banged the butt of his rifle on a 
womans foot 
But theres no courtyard at St James Palace which houses 
court officials and is less famous and tourists can touch the 
sentries there if they dare 
Greenway and Sir John BiggsDavison said they will raise the 
matter in Parliament BiggsDavison said he will ask Home Secretary 
Douglas Hurd for a police report on steps being taken to stop 
sentries being tantalized 
It is very unfair that soldiers have to endure these 
unpleasant attentions without in any way responding and it is not 
good for the dignity of royalty or for that matter the army 
BiggsDavison said 
Greenway said tourists also bothered the horses of mounted 
sentries on duty at the Horse Guards in Whitehall the center of 
government offices 
I have often seen tourists prodding the horses with their 
fingers he said That is not only most unfair and demeaning 
but highly dangerous too
