More than 150 former officers of the 
overthrown South Vietnamese government have been released from a 
reeducation camp after 13 years of detention the official Vietnam 
News Agency reported Saturday 
The report from Hanoi monitored in Bangkok did not give 
specific figures but said those freed Friday included an 
exCabinet minister a deputy minister 10 generals 115 
fieldgrade officers and 25 chaplains 
It quoted Col Luu Van Ham director of the Nam Ha camp south of 
Hanoi as saying all 700 former South Vietnamese officials who had 
been held at the camp now have been released 
They were among 1014 South Vietnamese who were to be released 
from reeducation camps under an amnesty announced by the Communist 
government to mark Tet the lunar new year that begins Feb 17 
The Vietnam News Agency report said many foreign journalists and 
a delegation from the AustraliaVietnam Friendship Association 
attended the Nam Ha release ceremony 
It said Lt Gen Nguyen Vinh Nghi former commander of South 
Vietnams Third Army Corps and Col Tran Duc Minh former director 
of the Army Infantry Officers School expressed gratitude to the 
government for its humane treatment in spite of the fact that most 
of them detainees had committed heinous crimes against the 
country and people 
The prisoners had been held without formal charges or trial 
since North Vietnam defeated the USbacked South Vietnamese 
government in April 1975 ending the Vietnam War 
Communist authorities had called the prisoners war criminals and 
said they had to learn how to become citizens of the new society 
Small numbers had been released occasionally without publicity 
but the government announced last year that 480 political prisoners 
would be freed to mark National Day on Sept 2 
On Thursday Vice Minister of Information Phan Quang said 1014 
would be released under the Tet amnesty 
He reported a total of 150 prisoners would remain in the camps 
which he said once held 100000 
Depending on their repentance they will gradually be released 
within a short period of time Quang said 
He said many of the former inmates would return to their 
families in Ho Chi Minh City formerly the South Vietnamese capital 
of Saigon 
The amnesties apparently are part of efforts by Communist Party 
chief Nguyen Van Linh to heal internal divisions and improve 
Vietnams image abroad
