The nations baby boomers are poised for the 
first time to swing a presidential election according to a 
University of Minnesota research fellow 
Theres a good chance the baby boom vote could play a key role 
this year said Harry Boyte a research fellow at the Humphrey 
Institute of Public Affairs 
Boyte said a candidate who shows concern about the economy job 
security home ownership and the future of children can win baby 
boomer votes 
He said however that would require tapping an underlying 
social concern among older baby boomers who fought for civil 
righs and womens issues and awakening a political interest in 
younger baby boomers who have generally shunned activism 
But Bill Morris a private pollster in the Twin Cities says 
theres a coalition out there waiting to be mobilized but that 
none of the presidential candidates is doing it 
But some political analysts say it cant be done because the 
baby boomers are too varied to fit under one political banner

The campaign of Democratic presidential 
hopeful Bruce Babbitt is selling some computers but a spokesman 
says that doesnt mean the former Arizona governors campaign is 
closing up shop 
The Phoenix Gazette reported Monday that notices were posted on 
bulletin boards in Babbitt for President campaign offices in 
Phoenix Washington Des Moines Iowa and Concord NH offering 
nine computers to staff members for 1000 apiece 
The Gazettes story referred to the notices as what may be the 
most telling indicator of Babbitts fortunes in Tuesdays New 
Hampshire primary 
Campaign spokesman Scott Phelps denied that the computer sale 
indicated the campaign was closing and said the campaign has more 
computers than it needs now that last weeks Iowa caucuses where 
Babbitt finished fifth are completed

Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young will be part of a 
panel of moderators questioning presidential hopefuls for both 
major parties this week in nationally televised debates leading up 
to the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8 
The presidential debates will be held at Southern Methodist 
University in Dallas with the Democratic debate set for Thursday 
night and the Republican debate the following night 
Joining Young on the panel are Martin Anderson former adviser 
to President Reagan on domestic and economic affairs and 
television journalist Roger Mudd 
Young said he intends to focus first on international and 
national economics his primary areas of interest but frame his 
questions broadly Young said viewers should expect no twisting 
questions from him 
I think its a mistake to try to trick the candidates to 
undercut them to put them on the spot Young said Ever since 
Gerald Ford made a mistake or Nixon didnt look good people have 
perceived debates as a pressure cooker which will eliminate 
somebody I dont know that thats necessarily good
