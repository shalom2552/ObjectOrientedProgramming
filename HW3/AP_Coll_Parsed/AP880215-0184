On the eve of the firstinthenation New 
Hampshire primary Massachusetts Gov Michael S Dukakis ignored 
polls showing him far ahead and said the Democratic race is 
tightening 
Dukakis said he believes the attacks of his chief rivals 
Missouri Rep Richard Gephardt and Illinois Sen Paul Simon may 
have cut into his support 
I havent been watching a lot of television lately but Im 
told people have been saying some pretty nasty things about me 
Dukakis said I assume thats going to take its toll 
At a campaign stop in Concord Dukakis lashed back at some 
criticism he has been taking from Simon in recent days Dukakis 
bristled at the charge by Simon that he is a technocrat who doesnt 
care about people 
Ask the people who know me best Dukakis said if there is 
another state in the country that is seriously proposing universal 
health care I dont think youll find that in Illinois 
Simon Dukakis said obviously does not know what hes talking 
about 
Dukakis crisscrossed New Hampshire in a whirlwind final day of 
campaigning He said he would not speculate whether he will achieve 
the 10 percentage point margin that some observers have said is the 
dividing line between a convincing and a disappointing victory 
margin for the governor 
In the closing days of a campaign things always tighten 
Dukakis said The governor repeatedly exhorted his charges to take 
nothing for granted Tuesday and to work until the polls close to 
get out the Dukakis vote 
Looking ahead to primaries in the southern states including 
Super Tuesday March 8 when nearly all the Southern states hold 
primaries Dukakis said he will write off no region or state 
I want to be a candidate who demonstrates that he can do well 
in all parts of the country he said 
In a speech in Claremont NH to about 2000 students from 
several school districts Dukakis abandoned a prepared text in 
which he planned to take direct aim at Gephardt and Simon 
In one particularly pointed line directed at Gephardt in the 
prepared text Dukakis quoted from a speech by Missouri native 
Harry S Truman in which the late president said 
The policy of reducing barriers to trade is a settled policy 
of government It is a policy from which we cannot and must not 
turn aside 
Instead Dukakis freewheeled giving a brief standard campaign 
summary and then taking questions
