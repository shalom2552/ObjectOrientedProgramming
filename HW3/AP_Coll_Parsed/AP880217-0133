A judge in the Nazi war crimes trial of John 
Demjanjuk today reprimanded a defense attorney for comparing the 
proceedings to the Dreyfus case in which a Jewish officer in the 
French army was falsely convicted of treason 
Presiding Judge Dov Levine ordered defense attorney Paul Chumak 
to retract the statement and said No court in the world would 
allow such unfair claims to be made 
Chumak refused repeatedly but when Levine threatened to cite 
him for contempt of court both sides agreed to take the issue up 
at Thursdays session 
Chumak told the court during closing arguments that Capt 
Alfred Dreyfus was convicted at the beginning of the century on 
the basis of false documents in a wave of antiSemitism 
Paralleling this with antiUkrainianism this trial has all the 
earmarks of the Dreyfus trial 
The Ukrainianborn Demjanjuk is accused of being Ivan the 
Terrible a sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that killed 
850000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazioccupied Poland in 
1942 and 1943 
Demjanjuk 67 a retired Ohio autoworker claims he is a victim 
of mistaken identity He says he served in the Soviet army was 
captured by the Germans in 1941 and remained in prisoner of war 
camps until 1943 
Earlier Chumak alleged that the Soviet secret police forged a 
key piece of prosecution evidence as part of an elaborate 
conspiracy to discredit the Israeli court and create a rift between 
Ukrainians and Jews in the Soviet Union 
Chumak said the KGB forged the document Demjanjuks alleged 
Nazi identity card so it could accuse the court of injustice if 
Demjanjuk were convicted 
Levine responded sharply calling the theory distasteful 
The Sovietsupplied document is the socalled Trawniki card The 
prosecution alleged it was issued to Demjanjuk at Trawniki a Nazi 
training camp for death camp guards near Treblinka 
Chumak also sought to discredit prosecution witness Patricia 
Smith one of several experts who testified to the authenticity of 
the card 
Ms Smith an anthropologist authenticated Demjanjuks picture 
on the Trawniki card by superimposing it on video footage of the 
defendant taken two years ago 
Chumak called Ms Smiths method an unexplored field and 
said it was not accepted by the scientific community 
The defense is to wrap up its case Thursday and a verdict from 
the threejudge panel is expected by April If convicted Demjanjuk 
could face the death penalty
