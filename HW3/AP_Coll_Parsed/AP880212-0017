Empty Bullfrog County created from 
scrubland in a bid to assure the state of federal dollars should 
the government build a nuclear dump in Nevada violates the state 
constitution a judge has ruled 
Judge David Zenoff said Thursday the county stretched its legal 
limits every which way and left too many constitutional issues 
hanging in the air 
Nye County from which unpopulated Bullfrog County was carved 
had challenged the 1987 Legislatures creation of the states 18th 
county 
Zenoff a former state Supreme Court justice brought in to hear 
the case issued the ruling after less than 30 minutes of oral 
arguments in district court 
Zenoff said the governors authority to appoint three 
commissioners for the county ran contrary to the democratic 
process and contributed to its failure to provide representative 
government 
I cannot in good conscience uphold this law he said 
Obviously were very pleased said Nye County District 
Attorney Phil Dunleavy It confirms what weve been saying all 
along As far as Im concerned Bullfrog County is dead and it 
should be 
Attorney Frank Daykin representing the Legislature and Bullfrog 
County said it would be up to the Legislative Commission to decide 
whether to appeal Zenoffs ruling to the state Supreme Court 
The commissions next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday 
We usually dont accept defeat in the Legislature said 
commission Chairman Lawrence Jacobsen 
Legislators created the county out of a 144squaremile chunk of 
Nye County as a way of giving the state control over federal funds 
available for the proposed Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada is 
one of three sites under consideration 
Had Bullfrog County been selected the US government would 
have had to compensate the staterun county an estimated 8 million 
to 25 million a year officials said 
Personally I hope the Legislature doesnt appeal it because 
its brought enough embarrassment to Nevada and should be allowed 
to lay in peace Dunleavy said The Legislature needs to 
rethink its approach to the problem 
Nye County stands to lose revenue should the new county remain 
on the books 
Gov Richard Bryan who signed the law creating the county into 
effect issued only a brief statement upon learning of Zenoffs 
decision 
This apparently resolves the Bullfrog County issue unless the 
Legislature chooses to appeal he said 
Karen Zupon the governors press secretary said Bryan has 
always said hell abide by the courts decision Hes not a party 
to the suit and he hasnt said anything about whether he thinks it 
should be appealed 
Nye County challenged the countys creation on 37 different 
legal grounds in a 92page brief Its major complaint was Bullfrog 
Countys failure to provide representative government 
Zenoff agreed saying it was not answerable to the people 
Among other things he said the law made no provisions for a 
judicial district or legislative representation for the county
