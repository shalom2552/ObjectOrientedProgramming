The United States has accepted for 
resettlement 604 more Amerasians and their relatives but is still 
waiting to discuss its proposal to resettle all Amerasians within 
two years a US official said Wednesday 
Ross Petzing spokesman for the US Embassy in Bangkok said a 
team of US officials held interviews with the latest group of 
halfAmerican children and family members in Ho Chi Minh City on 
Feb 415 
US officials have approved the applications of 1672 
Amerasians and family members since Hanoi broke a long deadlock and 
resumed the resettlement program in September Petzing said 
But he said there was no word on when the two sides would 
discuss the twoyear program proposed by the United States 
We are still awaiting a date from the Vietnamese for this 
meeting to take place Petzing said 
Two US congressmen said after visiting Hanoi last month that 
Nguyen Co Thach Vietnams deputy premier and foreign minister had 
agreed in principle to the proposal Reps Robert J Mrazek 
DNY and Thomas J Ridge RPa had said there soon would be 
talks to work out a formal agreement 
Mrazek and Ridge cosponsored a bill signed into law on Dec 
22 that requires that all Amerasians be resettled in the United 
States within two years It also created a new category of 
immigrants Amerasians who have been leaving Vietnam as refugees 
US officials estimate there are about 10000 Amerasians and 
twice that number of relatives still in Vietnam They were 
fathered by US servicemen and civilians during Americas military 
involvement in Vietnam which ended with a pullout in 1973
