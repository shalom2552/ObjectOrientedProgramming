President Reagan asked Congress on Thursday 
for a new tax break to help parents finance a college education for 
their children 
In a budget recommending only a few tax changes Reagan called 
for requiring all state and local government employees to pay a tax 
for Medicare coverage He proposed a permanent tax benefit for 
owners of shares in mutual funds and an expanded break for 
independent oil producers 
In general Reagans proposed budget for the 12 months beginning 
next Oct 1 reflect his reluctance to recommend tax expenditures 
that would worsen the federal deficit and his opposition to 
raising taxes to cut that deficit 
However in his written message to Congress the president noted 
that costs of postsecondary education have increased 
substantially in recent years often faster than inflation As a 
result parents may have difficulty bearing these costs unless they 
establish a savings program for this purpose when their chidren are 
young 
To help solve that problem Reagan said he will propose that 
Congress exempt from taxation the interest earned on certain bonds 
that are redeemed to pay for college or vocational education of a 
taxpayer spouse or dependents 
The tax exclusion would be targeted on lower and middleincome 
taxpayers and would be phased out as incomes rise Neither the 
limitation on how much interest could be excluded nor the phaseout 
level has been decided by the Reagan administration 
The idea is not a new one in fact several bills with a 
considerable amount of support are pending in Congress to achieve 
the same goal 
One bill by Rep Pat Williams DMont would allow a family to 
buy a maximum of 2000 worth of taxfree bonds per year If the 
bonds were cashed for any purpose other than education the 
interest would be taxed and the owner would have to pay a 
10percent penalty 
Williams bill would allow the interest exclusion for regular 
savings bonds that students already own assuming those bonds are 
used to finance an education Reagans proposal would allow the 
benefit only for bonds issued after 1988 
The administration estimates its proposal would cost the 
government 10 million next year By 1991 that would rise to 100 
million 
Other revenue proposals in the budget would 
Require all state and local government employees to pay the 
145percent Medicare tax Most workers including statelocal 
employees hired after March 31 1986 already pay the tax as part 
of their Social Security payroll tax The president wants all hired 
before that date to pay as well on grounds most of them are 
eligible for Medicare benefits through their spouse or by having 
worked previously in a nongovernment job This would cost those 
workers 16 billion in 1989 and 21 billion in 1990 
Make permanent a oneyear tax break enacted in December for 
owners of mutualfund shares saving those shareholders 400 
million a year 
One provision in the 1986 tax overhaul allows deduction of 
miscellaneous expenses such as union dues only to the extent 
they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income The law also 
requires mutual funds to pass along to shareholders certain costs 
of managing the funds which must be reported as income Without 
the special tax break many shareholders would have no way of 
deducting those costs 
Make permanent a special tax credit expiring at the end of 
1988 for increased expenditures for research and experimentation 
This costs the government 400 million a year 
Allow US companies that operate abroad to allocate at least 
twothirds of their research expenses to domestic income saving 
them 600 million a year 
Permit the targetedjobs tax credit under which the 
government pays a share of the wages of poorer workers to expire 
as scheduled at the end of 1988 
Repeal the windfallprofit tax on the oil industry which 
was enacted in 1980 to take a portion of sharply rising oil prices 
Reagan says the tax makes no sense now that prices have fallen 
significantly 
Modify rules under which independent oil producers may claim 
the oildepletion deduction The changes would allow the deduction 
even when certain oil properties are obtained from major oil 
companies and even when the writeoff exceeds netincome 
limitations This would save producers 52 million in 1989 
Repeal a congressional provision that would automatically cut 
taxes on airline tickets and aviation fuel when federal spending 
for airport and airways improvements drops below a certain level
