As Republican presidential candidates sat 
on a college stage debating the problem of AIDS backers of 
presidential candidate Pat Robertson were outside jeering at 
victims of the deadly disease 
Its your own fault the roughly 25 students holding Youth 
for Robertson signs chanted at nearly 70 members of a group 
called Cure AIDS Now 
One Robertson supporter outside the St Anselm College debate 
hall said he heckled the AIDS victims and their friends because 
they dont live right He refused to give his name 
Michael Petrelis an AIDS victim and coordinator of Cure AIDS 
Now derided the Roberston backers as real good Christians 
Several members of the AIDS advocacy group retaliated by yelling 
and blowing whistles at the Robertson supporters 
The verbal skirmish occurred in a parking lot near the debate 
hall The lot was filled with cheering supporters of Robertson 
Kansas Sen Robert Dole and New York Rep Jack Kemp as well as the 
AIDS group and a small group of opponents of the Seabrook nuclear 
plant 
Petrelis said his group encountered Robertson as he drove into 
the parking lot for the debate but drew no reaction from the 
former television evangelist 
The groups supporting the candidates dispersed as the debate 
began and about 10 minutes later police escorted the AIDS group 
from the St Anselm campus 
Earlier a Cure AIDS Now rally in Manchester drew a brief 
appearance from Democratic presidential hopeful Sen Paul Simon 
who said more educational efforts should be aimed at intravenous 
drug users a highrisk group for the disease 
We accomplished what we wanted which was to get one of the 
candidates to say the Aword Now we hope to press the candidates 
harder on what theyll do about AIDS once the field is narrowed 
down some Petrelis said
