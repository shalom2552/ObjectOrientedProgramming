County health officials are calling for 
roundtheclock mobile psychiatric teams to help police handle 
disturbed people who may erupt into violence 
The officials in a report to the City Council on Wednesday 
recommended placing psychiatric nurses and trained caseworkers at 
Parkland Memorial Hospital to be sent out as needed 
Many emergency crises could be effectively interrupted if 
professionals were available seven days a week 24 hours a day to 
be dispatched to the scene their report said 
Law enforcement mental health and city officials have been 
looking for ways to improve treatment and avert violence by the 
mentally ill since Officer John Glenn Chase was killed last month 
by a disturbed homeless man who grabbed his gun 
Police Chief Billy Prince told mental health advocates Wednesday 
that the Jan 23 shooting persuaded him to speak out on the need 
for better treatment 
We need to help get these people off the street Prince 
said If the mental health care had been better he wouldnt have 
been out there 
Carl D Williams who died in an exchange of gunfire after he 
shot and killed Chase in downtown Dallas had been diagnosed 10 
years earlier as a paranoid schizophrenic 
Prince said that although he earlier laid blame for the shooting 
to an antipolice atmosphere created by department critics he was 
unaware of Williams history of mental illness at the time 
Some witnesses said a few spectators urged Williams to shoot the 
officer others said they did not hear any such thing 
County health officials plan for the psychiatric unit won 
plaudits from council members who said costs and coordination 
would have to be examined before a decision is made 
This thing should have been pursued much earlier before the 
Chase shooting said Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Diane Ragsdale 
Mental health experts estimate that only a small fraction of the 
mentally ill may become dangerous But Prince said officers 
regularly deal with more than a few time bombs who need 
treatment 
Youre talking about not only a social problem but a 
tremendous waste of police resources in dealing with the mentally 
ill who commit crimes Prince said
