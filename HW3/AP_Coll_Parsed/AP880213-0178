Former President Jimmy Carter speaking 
Saturday at the dedication of a new National Historic Site in his 
hometown praised the integrity and compassion of his neighbors 
saying they have traits that could benefit the rest of the country 
This is not just an opportunity to tell a story about a little 
farm boy who became president Carter told 450 shivering 
wellwishers gathered at the 19th century railroad station that 
served as his 1976 campaign headquarters 
It is an opportunity to tell the story to visitors from this 
nation and around the world of what America is all about 
You can talk to almost anyone who lives here and see 
characteristics of strength of honesty of integrity of 
compassion of understanding and of support Carter said 
Legislation signed into law Dec 23 designates Carters home 
the railroad depot a vacant brick building where he graduated from 
high school in 1941 and his boyhood home in nearby Archery as a 
National Historic Site 
John Tucker who will manage the site in addition to his duties 
as superintendent of the Andersonville National Historic Site said 
the park service will open the depot for tours and preserve Carter 
memorabilia displayed in a small museum there 
The Park Service also will offer tours of Plains and eventually 
will restore the depot the high school and Carters boyhood home 
The Carters will donate their fourbedroom ranchstyle house built 
in 1961 to the Park Service but will continue to occupy it 
throughout their lifetimes 
On hand for the ceremony were Sen Wyche Fowler and Rep Richard 
Ray two Georgia Democrats who led a sixyear effort to win 
congressional approval for the site 
Ray whose district includes Plains said the success of a farm 
boy who went on to become a state senator a governor and the 
nations 39th president is an example of what this country is all 
about 
President Carter was an excellent president and during the 
past five to seven years weve found out he was an even better 
president than we thought he was he said 
William Penn Mott Jr director of the National Park Service 
said Plains has the potential to become one of the top visitor 
attractions in the South 
By itself the life story of Jimmy Carter has earned a place 
in our hearts as well as our history he said But it struck me 
that we also have an opportunity to tell another story here the 
story of the rural South its agricultural heritage the strength 
and character of its people 
Currently about 80000 visitors a year stop at Plains small 
welcome center In a few years after the Park Service has improved 
some of the attractions Plains could attract up to 300000 
visitors a year Tucker said
