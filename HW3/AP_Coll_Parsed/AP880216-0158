A group of American scientists on Tuesday 
disputed Reagan administration statements that it was not practical 
to verify the dismantlement of nuclear warheads under an arms 
control agreement 
Members of the Federation of American Scientists outlined at a 
news conference a dismantlement plan worked out earlier this month 
in conjunction with the Committee of Soviet Scientists Against the 
Nuclear Threat headed by Roald Sagdayev head of the Soviet 
civilian space agency 
Jeremy J Stone president of the US group and members Frank 
von Hippel and Theodore B Taylor said they were concerned that 
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci may have raised misconceptions 
in defending the Intermediaterange Nuclear Forces pact The pact 
calls for the elimination of all mediumrange US and Soviet 
missiles 
Carlucci and other administration officials defending the 
treaty against conservative Sen Jesse Helms RNC said it did 
not require the destruction of warheads from the banned missiles 
because verifying that step could expose secrets on how the devices 
are built 
The administration further argued that destroying the warheads 
would free up weaponsgrade plutonium which could be used by 
terrorists And officials said the Soviets could simply produce 
more weapons material to replace any destroyed 
Although Stone Taylor and Von Hippel support the INF pact they 
took issue with Carlucci and proposed a system under which 
warheads could be dismantled and the material either used in 
reactors or buried underground 
Under the plan the Soviet Union and United States would each 
designate a dismantlement site which would be closely monitored to 
prevent the clandestine entry or exit of nuclear material said 
Taylor who worked in the national laboratory at Los Alamos in 
194956 designing nuclear weapons 
Nuclear warheads entering the site would be tagged for 
identification and fingerprinted by neutron probes xrays or 
gamma rays which the scientists said would verify that the devices 
contained nuclear materials but would not disclose their inner 
workings 
The warheads would then be dismantled behind closed doors at the 
nation which owned them and inspectors from the other nation would 
verify that nuclear material had left the site 
In the case of American warheads Soviet inspectors would 
only have to verify that a batch of nuclear warheads had entered a 
US dismantlement facility and that after all the warheads had 
been dismantled and their components destroyed beyond recognition 
no intact nuclear warheads remained inside the scientists said in 
a statement 
Taylor and Von Hippel recommended that weaponsgrade plutonium 
from the warheads be mixed with radioactive wastes and buried 
They recommended that highly enriched uranium also used in 
nuclear weapons be used to fuel reactors for electric power plants 
The estimated cost of dismantling the warheads about 6 billion 
would be dwarfed by the value of the fuel about 50 billion they 
said 
Taylor said in a paper that the approximately 1000 tons of 
U235 enriched uranium and 200 tons of plutonium in the worlds 
more than 50000 nuclear warheads could be consumed as fuel in all 
US and Soviet nuclear power plants in seven years or in all the 
worlds nuclear power plants in about three years 
Von Hippel acknowledged that the scientists had not devised a 
foolproof plan to enable each side to be assured that the correct 
type and number of warheads were being dismantled under an arms 
control agreement involving multiple systems
