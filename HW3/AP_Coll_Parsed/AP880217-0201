Winning the New Hampshire primary gave little 
more than bragging rights to Vice President George Bush and 
Democrat Michael Dukakis as each came away with just a handful of 
national convention delegates 
Bush who picked up 38 percent of the Republican vote in the 
primary gained 11 of New Hampshires 23 delegates to the GOP 
national convention In all Bush now has 61 delegates 
Dukakis who got 36 percent of the Democratic vote in the 
Tuesday primary won nine of the states 18 pledged delegates to 
the national convention The Massachusetts governor has 445 
delegates 
The lift from the early primaries and caucuses is more 
psychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1139 
delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination or 
the 2082 delegates for the Democratic nomination 
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas gained seven 
delegates in New Hampshire Tuesday to bring his national total to 
42 while Rep Jack Kemp of New York won three delegates to raise 
his total to 35 
Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri the winner of last weeks 
Iowa Democratic caucuses gained six national convention delegates 
for his secondplace showing in New Hampshire and Sen Paul Simon 
of Illinois followed with three delegates In the popular vote in 
New Hampshire Gephardt won 20 percent while Simon had 17 percent 
Gephardt now has 39 delegates while Simon has 33 
Under Democratic Party rules the national convention delegates 
were awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15 
percent of the vote In effect that disqualified Jesse Jackson 
Sen Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee former Arizona Gov Bruce 
Babbitt and former Colorado Sen Gary Hart from receiving any 
delegates from New Hampshire 
Jackson won 8 percent of the vote Gore 7 percent Babbitt 5 
percent and Hart 4 percent 
New Hampshire Republicans have a similar rule but the threshold 
is 10 percent That meant former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont who 
had 10 percent picked up two delegates but former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson who was within 1100 votes of du Pont 
received no delegates because he had just 95 percent of the vote 
Robertson already had eight delegates while du Pont had none 
before Tuesdays primary 
Among the Democrats Gore already had 1055 delegates Jackson 
had 98 and Babbitt had four 
The delegate totals for the Republicans include results from 
Michigan Kansas Pennsylvania New Hampshire and Guam Although 
Iowa and Hawaii both have held GOP caucuses precise delegate 
figures cannot be calculated until later because of the way the 
selection process is structured 
The Democratic totals include results from Iowa and New 
Hampshire as well as an Associated Press survey of Democratic 
governors and Democratic National Committee members who will serve 
automatically as delegates to their partys convention Some of the 
Democratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention
