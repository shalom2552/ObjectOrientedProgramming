One year after jumping bail and failing to 
appear in court for a trial on sexualassault charges a former 
high school honor student remains on the lam pursued by a bounty 
hunter the FBI and police 
Alex A Kelly now 20 of Darien has been missing since he and 
his parents parted at Denvers Stapleton International Airport on 
Feb 15 1987 He had been working in Leadville Colo and he and 
his parents had booked separate flights to Newark NJ 
authorities said 
Four days later he failed to appear in court in Stamford for 
the start of his trial on charges that he raped two teenage girls 
in 1986 
Weve had a lot of rumors but as far as I know the trail is 
cold Assistant States Attorney Bruce P Hudock said I 
personally have at least another 10 years on this job so Im 
patient 
Kellys parents Joseph T and Melanie L Kelly declined to 
discuss their sons case or his disappearance 
They may lose their 450000 home in this welltodo suburb of 
New York City because they put it up as security for Kellys 
200000 bond raised to 450000 when he failed to appear 
Prosecutors have filed a foreclosure motion that is pending 
Bounty hunter Philip B Dole of New York entered the case last 
year after Gov William A ONeill authorized a 20000 reward 
Dole who usually works for bail bondsmen said recently that he 
has uncovered some leads by talking to Kellys friends and checking 
places where he was last seen He declined to describe the leads 
but he said he expects Kelly to be arrested in less than a year 
Hes going to make a mistake Dole said People who stay 
out that long feel no one is looking for them 
Kelly is charged with three counts of firstdegree sexual 
assault two counts of kidnapping and two counts of threatening in 
connection with the attacks on Feb 10 and 14 1986 
Kelly was arrested the day of the second assault only days 
after his Darien High School wrestling coach wrote an article in 
the weekly Darien NewsReview describing in glowing terms how the 
teenager had overcome a troubled past 
Kelly had been charged with nine burglaries in 1983 and 1984 
and was sentenced to a fourmonth drug treatment program 
Coach Jeffrey Bouvier wrote that Kelly had returned to school in 
the spring of 1985 after completing the drug program was earning 
As and had applied to colleges in Colorado 
He is open about his problem and speaks candidly to groups 
of freshmen about drugs and their potential to ruin a life 
Bouvier wrote 
Kellys attorney Michael Sherman of Stamford said he thinks 
his client jumped bail because he feared he would not receive a 
fair trial after a judge decided to try the two assault cases 
together 
Its very easy for the states attorney to be very macho about 
it but youre still looking at a 19yearold kid at the time who 
is afraid and who is facing 20 years in prison Sherman said He 
was referring to a sentence proposed by prosecutors under a plea 
bargain agreement 
Kellys parents have said they dont know where he is but 
police are suspicious 
The assault victims were initially apprehensive about the trial 
Hudock said but Kellys disappearance has left them angry 
I would say their feelings go to the area of justice not 
having been served he said Their interest seems to have 
increased in the past year
