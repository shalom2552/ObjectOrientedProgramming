A 17yearold chemistry student committed 
suicide by injecting a homemade cyanide solution into his veins 
and seven people became ill after apparently handling the chemicals 
or breathing fumes police said 
The youth mixed up a substance like that used in execution 
chambers said Lt Calvin Latsis Salt Lake County fire hazardous 
materials officer He knew exactly what he was doing 
Sheriffs Deputy Dan Haggen was listed in serious condition at 
St Marks Hospital today Fire officials said Haggens illness was 
compounded by an allergic reaction to a cyanide antidote 
Three other sheriffs officers also became ill several hours 
after going to the teenagers home Wednesday morning They and the 
deceased youths parents and a 10yearold sister were treated and 
released 
The deputies apparently did not recognize the youth had died 
from cyanide and had no idea they were in danger while in the room 
with his body Latsis said About four hours later they began 
experiencing headaches nausea and tightness of the chest said Tom 
Bogle fire battalion chief 
Cyanide poisoning can occur from either breathing fumes or 
absorption through the skin Gas had permeated the home when 
deputies arrived but they and others in the home may also have 
handled some of the chemicals the fire officials said 
The 17yearold whose name was not released was an advanced 
chemistry student at his high school He died after creating a 
lethal dose of cyanide from several chemicals and injecting it into 
his veins Latsis said 
Sheriffs deputies said the youth left a note indicating that he 
was not getting out of life what he was putting into it 
When cyanide was suspected in the illness of the deputies 
family members were evacuated
