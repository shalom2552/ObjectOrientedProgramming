Former employees of a steel mill shut down eight 
years ago voted overwhelmingly Sunday to accept a settlement with 
Navistar International Corp that will give them 148 million in 
benefits 
The vote by former Wisconsin Steel Works employees was 58375 to 
approve the settlement which provides about 67 million less than 
the workers initially had sought said attorney Judith Teeter who 
represents the 2700 workers 
These are old people They have been fighting this case for 
years and years and theyre very happy its settled Ms Teeter 
said after the vote at a local union hall 
The vote is not binding said attorney Leon Despres another 
workers representative But he called it highly persuasive 
The plan has to be determined by a judge he said But the 
overwhelming vote makes his approval very likely 
Navistar then known as International Harvester Co sold the 
Wisconsin Steel Works shortly before it went into bankruptcy and 
was shut down in 1980 
The Save Our Jobs Committee representing the mill workers 
filed an 82 million lawsuit against IH contending it sold the 
mill to escape the payment of termination benefits if the plant 
closed Despres said 
The 148 million figure was suggested as a compromise by US 
District Judge James Moran after two months of mediation sessions 
Despres said The settlement goes back to Moran for final approval 
If the settlement is approved each employee could receive an 
amount ranging from 200 to 17000 based on age and length of 
employment he said 
Navistar offices were closed Sunday and company officials could 
not be reached for comment
