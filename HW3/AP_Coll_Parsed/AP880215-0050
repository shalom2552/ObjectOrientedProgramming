Faced with a twoyear population boom family 
planning authorities today said pressure will be increased on local 
cadres to enforce Chinas onechildperfamily limit which has 
been widely defied 
The authorities while putting most of the blame for the birth 
surge on a peak in the number of childbearing women also 
complained of a slackening off of birth control fervor in some 
places 
From now on cadres who implement the family planning policies 
well will get benefits and those who do not do well will not get 
benefits and will even be punished Liang Jimin director of the 
State Family Planning Commissions general office told a news 
conference He did not describe the punishments 
He said the move was ordered by acting Premier Li Peng 
It follows two years in which the number of births jumped 
dramatically in some places exceeding the planned level by 30 
percent as more and more peasants have second and third children 
The nationwide growth rate which had been tamped down to 11 
percent in 1985 hit 14 percent in 1986 and again last year 
bringing the population to 107 billion or nearly 15 million more 
than planned 
Liang said the main reason for the surge is an increase in the 
number of women of childbearing age themselves products of a baby 
boom during the 1960s He said the effects of this boom echo 
would peak this year and next 
But his deputy Shen Guoxiang acknowledged that more than 30 
percent of the births each year were not part of the state plan 
meaning the women defied regulations and married before the legal 
age of 20 or had more than one child 
Only members of minority groups peasants in some very poor 
areas and couples whose first child is handicapped are allowed to 
have more than one child 
Earlier marriages and big families have become increasingly 
popular following the breakup of the communes in the early 1980s 
and the reinstitution of family farming Now that peasants can sell 
a large part of their crops for their own profit extra hands 
translate into extra money 
The peasants new prosperity also means they can afford to pay 
government fines for having second which vary from place to place 
but usually amount to 1000 or more yuan per year for five years 
The average peasant family earns 500 yuan 135 per person per 
year but in good farming regions incomes of 10000 yuan 2700 
are not uncommon 
The staterun media have acknowleged that many peasants view 
fines as an acceptable price for having the muchdesired big family 
Asked if the system encourged rich peasants to buy a second 
child Liang insisted No its not like that Our emphasis has 
always been on publicity and education He did not comment 
further 
In a frontpage article last month the staterun Peoples Daily 
said the trend toward having more than one child had reached crisis 
proportions and warned that China might not be able to reach its 
goal of limiting the population to 12 billion in the year 2000 
Liang said the situation was acute and the task ahead 
arduous but he said the limit of 12 billion was still possible 
He said new emphasis will be put on signing family planning 
contracts with fixed birth targets In some cases women will be 
asked to sign contracts with local organizations to have only one 
child a practice that has been used in the past 
In other cases he said work units will sign the contracts 
Work units already play a significant role in urban areas in 
enforcing the onechild policy and in many cases suspend workers 
for one or two years if they have a second child 
Asked if placing greater responsibility on local cadres to 
enforce the onechild limit could encourage coerced abortions Shen 
said We are not going to take the number of abortions done as 
one of the indicators of a cadres success 
China already has 50 abortions for every 100 live births Liang 
said this is because most women in the countryside use intrauterine 
devices as birth control and that these have a failure rate of 
about 20 percent
