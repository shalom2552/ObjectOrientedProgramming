that burst into flames early today a few yards from Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatchers official London residence and office killing 
the driver

trace of an explosive device It added At no time did the car 
make any attempt to enter Downing Street and therefore the prime 
minister was not in any danger

prime minister had been at 10 Downing Street at the time of the 
incident
