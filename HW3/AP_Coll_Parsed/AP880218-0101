City officials stockpiled water in reserve 
tanks today after about 100000 gallons of a toxic chemical leaked 
from a ruptured Sun Co pipeline threatening water supplies for 
22000 people and forcing 500 to be evacuated 
The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency warned officials of 
this northwest Ohio city to plan to stop drawing water soon from 
the Sandusky River because some of the toluene had flowed into the 
river near Tiffin nearly 20 miles upstream 
About 300 people in the town of Old Fort were ordered to 
evacuate their homes today as the spill moved downstream said 
Seneca County Sheriff Weldon Neff About 200 residents in an 
18squaremile area along the Sandusky River were evacuated 
Wednesday night 
Three people were treated for exposure to toluene A firefighter 
inhaled the fumes and two other people fell into icecovered 
contaminated water 
Fremonts reserve tanks have been filled They hold about 4 
million gallons about one days normal supply said Gary 
Rathfelder assistant superintendent of the water plant He said 
the city will close the water intake valves just before the spill 
reaches the city 
The spill was about 12 miles upstream from Fremont and would 
reach the city in about two days he said this morning 
Don Higgins environmental coordinator for the Ohio 
Environmental Protection Agency said officials are not sure how 
much toluene had leaked into Sugar Creek a tributary of the 
Sandusky River Earthen dams were built on the creek to block 
further movement of the chemical into the river 
Its not the kind of stuff you want in a river he said 
It wont kill you but you dont want to be around it for too 
long 
Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or 
poisonous gases according to an emergency response guidebook 
published by the US Department of Transportation The chemical is 
used as an octance enhancer 
Forrest Brokaw spokesman for the Tulsa Oklabased Sun Pipe 
Line said he learned late Wednesday that some of the chemical 
spilled into the river and could affect Fremonts water supplies 
Sun Pipe Line is a division of the Sun Co 
Well naturally begin something to make sure they get 
emergency water supplies he said 
Brokaw said the spill was caused by a split in the line that 
might be connected to a 20gallon leak earlier Wednesday The 
pipeline runs from a Sun refinery in Toledo in northwest Ohio to a 
refinery in Marcus Hook Pa south of Philadelphia 
Workers have not pinpointed the leak however said Bob Arnet 
an environmental safety coordinator for Sun Pipe Line Its been 
shut off but its still leaking he said
