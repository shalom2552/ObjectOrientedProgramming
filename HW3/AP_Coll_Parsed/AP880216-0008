The House resumes its struggle toward a 
national AIDS policy this week with two sharply contrasting 
Californians at the extremes of disputes over issues ranging from 
discrimination to testing 
On one side is Democratic Rep Henry Waxman the liberal and 
influential chairman of the House health subcommittee whose Los 
Angeles district is ethnically diverse and bigcity tolerant 
Across the ideological gulf but geographically next door is Rep 
William Dannemeyer RCalif a conservative from straightlaced 
and suburban Orange County 
Their differences will be aired Friday at what Waxman is calling 
a refresher hearing on his bill to provide money for voluntary 
AIDS tests guarantee confidentiality for those tested and protect 
AIDS victims and carriers from discrimination 
The hearing follows a series of canceled work sessions last year 
that Dannemeyer claims were scratched because Waxman didnt have 
enough votes to win approval of his bill 
If he cant achieve his objective of antidiscrimination 
status for those with the virus he will not move a bill in the 
100th Congress Dannemeyer said 
We had other things pressing on us Waxman responded when 
asked why the sessions were canceled He said he expects to finish 
work on the AIDS bill within two months 
Though he maintained he is always open to discussion Waxman 
indicated he would not compromise on the measures confidentiality 
or civil rights provisions and said he detected little support for 
Dannemeyers positions 
The whole public health world has concluded we need to protect 
against discrimination Waxman said The only people likely to 
come in for tests if there is no protection are people at low 
risk of having AIDS 
Dannemeyer calls it inappropriate and absurd to legislate 
antidiscrimination safeguards because of what he contends is the 
unstable status of information about AIDS transmission 
While Waxman quotes the prevailing view of virtually all public 
health authorities that AIDS cannot be transmitted by casual 
contact Dannemeyer asserts that those authorities are rethinking 
their dogmatic pronouncements that the AIDS virus is not a threat 
in the workplace 
Dannemeyer says employers should be free to decide whether to 
fire an AIDS victim or carrier 
The civil rights of the uninfected are entitled to just as 
much protection as the infected Dannemeyer said He also 
asserted that protecting AIDS victims from discrimination conflicts 
with the heterosexual ethic 
Going against the grain of prevailing psychiatric thought he 
contended that homosexuals voluntarily choose their sexual 
preference and said schoolchildren should be taught that 
homosexuality is a perverse lifestyle its an unhealthy 
lifestyle Thats a fact We should tell that to kids 
Dannemeyer has introduced a bill requiring AIDS testing of 
marriage license applicants hospital patients people being 
treated for venereal disease and people convicted of drug or sex 
crimes He has also sponsored a bill that requires reporting by 
name of every individual who has AIDS or tests positive for 
antibodies to the AIDS virus 
Waxman said Dannemeyer and others who promote such reporting 
requirements seem to want these names for some other purpose 
and that suspicion would discourage highrisk individuals from 
being tested 
We have a clear danger of hysterical overreaction where many 
people might find themselves persecuted for being infected 
Waxman said We cant get sidetracked into an antigay crusade 
when our real job is to stop the spread of this terrible disease 
Waxman said the biggest concern at this point is not the 
transmission of AIDS among homosexuals but its spread among 
intravenous drug users and their sexual contacts in the 
underclass 
Dannemeyer contended that strong homosexual lobbies are hobbling 
Congress and some state legislatures in their handling of the 
disease He said AIDS victims have received kidglove treatment 
that flies in the face of traditional ways to halt epidemics 
If 73 percent of the AIDS cases were presented by people 
with gray eyes a highly disorganized group in America three years 
ago we would have witnessed largescale quarantine of anyone who 
had the virus he said 
Dannemeyer also condemned an educational film created by the Gay 
Mens Health Crisis in New York City He distributed videotaped 
copies to reporters and said the film uses tax dollars to promote 
homosexuality 
The tape features blunt language a demonstration of condom use 
on a cucumber and a scene of two men kissing in a shower 
Waxman said he had not seen the tape but added I wouldnt 
know how to design a message to the gay community I dont think 
Mr Dannemeyer would know how to design it But wed better 
start getting the message across and not pull our punches because 
were fearful of talking about sex
