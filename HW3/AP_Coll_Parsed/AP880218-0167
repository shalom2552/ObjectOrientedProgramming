The parents of a 5yearold girl 
stricken with AIDS have removed her from kindergarten just as 
community tensions over the girls admission appeared to be waning 
The girls parents said they decided to withdraw their child 
from the Roche Avenue Elementary School to give her more time to 
mature and give the community and school a chance to better prepare 
for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome said 
Principal Robert Boulton 
The girls removal wont stop efforts to educate parents and 
children about the lethal disease Superintendent Jacob Rankin said 
Were obviously going to plow ahead not only with parent 
information programs but also with developing AIDS policies he 
said 
Enrollment of the unidentified girl last week had caused concern 
by some parents about the safety of their children despite 
assurances from health officials that AIDS is not spread by casual 
contact 
Health officials have not said how the girl contracted the AIDS 
virus 
Some parents kept their youngsters out of school earlier inthe 
week as a protest The number of absences fell from 97 on Tuesday 
to 42 on Wednesday as attendance returned to normal 
School officials complying with state law refused to provide 
any details about the girls identity or background The girl had 
been examined by the Tulare County Health Department Valley 
Medical Center in Fresno and her personal physician and was deemed 
fit to attend public school 
The girl attended class Feb 8 but it wasnt mandatory for her 
to start kindergarten this year
