A bold thief stole a judges folded robe 
and keys while the judge stood a few feet away posing for a 
campaign photograph 
Circuit Judge Sam Monk was posing on the front steps of the 
courthouse Thursday and put his robe just inside the front doors 
only a few feet away He hid his keys in the robe after the 
photographer said they were making his pocket bulge 
Asked what he thought about the thiefs brashness the judge 
said The kings English fails me in that question 
Its obvious they knew what they were doing and who they were 
doing it to said Presiding Circuit Judge Malcolm Street Jr 
The church choir was not standing on the front steps 
This is just another glaring example of the lack of proper 
security in the county courthouse said Monk Locks have been 
changed at the courthouse and Monk has had to change locks in and 
around his home 
The robe was found in a downtown garbage bin but the keys are 
still missing
