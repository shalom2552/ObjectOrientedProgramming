JaymarRuby Inc which popularized 
the nobelt look for mens slacks has decided theres a future in 
belt loops 
Tired of battling the image that its stretchy waistbands are 
only for potbellies the company is readying a new advertising 
campaign to tell the world that Sansabelt is an old name with new 
style 
While conventional Sansabelt beltless slacks will still be 
sold Jaymar also will be offering pants designed for belts in 
1988 in a marked departure from its 29yearold marketing strategy 
Elbert Hand then JaymarRubys acting president said he got 
the idea for the change while watching the Masters golf tournament 
last April Hand who is chief operating officer of Chicagos 
Hartmarx Corp Jaymars parent company says he remembers seeing a 
wide range of men wearing Sansabelt 
Old guys and young guys and fat guys and skinny guys Hand 
said And those who seemed like they cared about how they looked 
and those who didnt 
Hand said there is a stereotypical image of the average 
Sansabelt wearer slightly overweight interested in comfort 
uninterested in fashion 
He decided it was time to wage war against that cliche 
Hand said that while Jaymar had an impressive 20to25percent 
share of the mens quality 40 and up slacks market it embarked 
last summer on an extensive consumer survey to find out what men 
liked and disliked in fashion 
The survey indicated a lot more men than the company had ever 
realized couldnt stand pants without belts Hand said 
The answers there were fairly clear said Jerry McCann 
Jaymars vice president for marketing communications Its part 
of the look Its like a whitecollar guy not wearing a tie to 
work 
Steve McGue who took over as Jaymars president in October 
says probelt customers were found to be an awesome segment of 
the better slacks business 
At the same time it was becoming apparent that Jaymars 1987 
sales would fail to break records for the first time in 10 years 
and that 1987 profits would lag behind those of 1986 
Sansabeltwithabelt was born last summer after Jaymar 
executives searched their corporate soul and the idea was endorsed 
by McGue when he took control 
For five weeks now sales people have been writing orders for 
the newstyle slacks with considerable success company executives 
say The fall line will hit stores next summer 
Because Sansabelt is a French and English amalgamation that 
literally means with no belt an obvious risk is that the new 
strategy will confuse customers 
I know its a contradiction in terms Hand admitted 
But Jaymar executives predict they can retain the Sansabelt 
customer who has sworn by beltless pants for decades They also 
think they can attract a more trendconscious perhaps younger man 
who doesnt associate the brand name with no belt anyway 
Its addressing a market that weve never addressed before 
thats a huge market McGue said 
To spread the word about the new Sansabelt line the company 
will undertake the biggest advertising campaign of its recent 
history Ads beginning in late August and September will show 
youngerlooking models wearing both beltless and beltstyle 
Sansabelt slacks The new slogan will be With a belt without a 
belt Sansabelt fashion it feels great 
Magazine ads will appear in Gentlemens Quarterly Sports 
Illustrated Esquire New York Times magazine and other 
publications
