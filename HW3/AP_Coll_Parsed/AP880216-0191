Theyre married but not married Theyre 
divorced but not divorced Thats the paradoxical plight of 
thousands of religiously observant Jewish women in broken marriages 
Although civilly divorced the man wont grant a religious bill 
of divorcement called a get 
Only the man can do that under Jewish law as observed in 
Conservative and Orthodox Judaism and if he doesnt that leaves 
her in an ambiguous state her marriage ended civilly but still 
binding her religiously 
Shes in a limbo neither married nor unmarried says 
Benita GayleAlmeleh of the American Jewish Committee who has done 
special research into the problem urging rabbinical action to 
remedy it 
In such circumstances she points out the woman is not free 
to remarry to pick up the pieces and go on with her life Her 
marriage has been dissovled but not dissolved 
Mrs GayleAlmeleh estimates at least 35000 Jewish women across 
the country are trapped in that situation 15000 of them in New 
York state alone 
Theyre in a terrible predicament she said in an interview 
maintaining that the problem has reached crisis proportions Jewish 
law requires no religious release for men to remarry but does for 
women 
It has a tremendous impact on the entire family in trying to 
raise and socialize children Its a continuous irritant and cause 
of tension It has the builtin possibility of a continually 
fractured family 
She said men withhold the religious get for various reasons 
sometimes for emotional financial or other blackmail to gain 
concessions about property or child custody 
This happens plenty of times she said In essence its 
extortion She said the possibility of a religious divorce is 
dangled in front of the aggrieved spouse to meet various demands 
In other cases she said women cant obtain religious divorces 
because the former husband is simply neglectful lazy refuses it 
in vindictiveness after the breakup drops out of sight or some 
fluke of cirumstances 
Without a get the civilly divorced woman under Jewish law 
is termed an agunah or anchored wife not free to remarry 
since further sexual union would be considered adulterous and any 
offspring would be mamzerim or bastards Mrs GayleAlmeleh 
said 
Such children are forbidden to marry other Jews and to this 
day they carry a terrible social stigma 
Mrs GayleAlmeleh program specialist in AJCs Interreligious 
Affairs Department and coordinator of its Women of Faith program 
said this painful religious problem demands creative and 
immediate action 
She commended the New York Board of Rabbis for a recent 
resolution urging sanctions against any former spouse who refuses 
to provide a get after a civil divorce if the woman wants one 
Such sanctions would involve denial of synagogue membership 
privileges such as the honor of being called to read the Torah 
Mrs GayleAlmeleh called the action a positive step but 
said the likelihood was that if a man had refused to supply a 
get he may well be beyond the point of caring 
For anyone willing to flout community morals this way his 
being called to read the Torah probably doesnt make a big 
difference she said However she said the system may be 
effective in some few instances 
The board also recommended that all rabbis urge couples to sign 
prenuptial agreements saying that in event of civil divorce both 
partners will cooperate in arranging for a get 
That however wouldnt solve prior situations 
She also cited drawbacks to a recently recently enacted New York 
State legislation saying a Jewish husband who filed for civil 
divorce must also grant his wife a get if she wanted it 
She said the constitutionality of the law has been questioned as 
on the slippery slope of churchstate entanglement and its 
also questionable if Jewish law should be subjected to legal 
systems and courts in 50 states 
Furthermore she said that such legislation puts the burden 
on women to get the state to compel relief It would require 
emotional timeconsuming and costly litigation an unacceptable 
route for many women 
In Reform Judaism a civilly divorced woman doesnt also need a 
religious divorce to remarry but it is required in Conservative 
and Orthodox branches 
Its one of the few instances in which Jewish law is rife with 
the possibility of mischief Mrs GayleAlmeleh said 
In a recent address on the problem to a womans conference in 
Philadelphia she said that through the centuries rabbis have made 
various efforts to temper the onesidedness of biblical law on 
the matter 
She said attempts have been made to get around the dictum that 
only a man has the right to divorce religiously but 
nevertheless a religious divorce is never granted in the absence 
of or without the consent of the husband
