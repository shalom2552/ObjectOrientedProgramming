Advocates for the homeless bore the plain 
wooden caskets of a man and woman to a Pennsylvania Avenue plaza 
across from city hall on Saturday and prayed for a world where 
people do not die in the cold 
Bundled against subfreezing temperatures and a bitter wind 
about 40 activists conducted a funeral service dubbed tasteless 
by city officials a day after the authorities lost a legal fight 
for custody of the corpses 
Mitch Snyder leader of the Community for Creative NonViolence 
said the public service prior to cremation of the bodies was 
designed to call attention to the deaths of 10 homeless people this 
winter on the streets of the capital The city says 13 people have 
died of hypothermia seven of them homeless 
Snyders group said prayers for Henry Dixon found dead of 
hypothermia Jan 2 at a parking attendants booth three blocks from 
the funeral site and for an unidentified woman who died Jan 7 
The Rev William Wendt holding his left hand on the casket of 
the woman called Jane Doe read the names of the dead as those 
surrounding him cried out Forgive us after each name 
Let us pray for ourselves who are tested by their deaths 
Wendt said May God grant us and others too new courage to face 
life and do something about it This world should be a place 
where people have a home and do not die in the cold 
CCNV says it has picked up from the city morgue the remains of 
about 40 people in the last eight years who have died of 
hypothermia and whose families have not come forward to claim the 
bodies The city had agreed in the past to turn the bodies over to 
CCNV in the groups capacity as a friend of the homeless The 
group has preserved the ashes of each victim 
Jerome Woods director the Department of Human Services ordered 
the two bodies held this week however citing a city law that 
allows the government to withhold the remains if they are to be 
used in a tasteless way 
US District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the bodies 
released Friday saying CCNVs plans for a service on Pennsylvania 
Avenue were no different in principle than the public funeral 
corteges of President Kennedy and the Rev Martin Luther King Jr 
I cant believe we had a tugofwar over this said Snyder 
wrapped in a blanket against the cold winds The city doesnt 
care about these people when theyre alive and all of a sudden 
they care when theyre dead 
CCNV members said the city has ignored a city law passed last 
month requiring public buildings to be opened to the homeless when 
the temperature falls below 25 degrees 
City officials countered that an elementary school was opened to 
the homeless but wasnt fully utilized by them
