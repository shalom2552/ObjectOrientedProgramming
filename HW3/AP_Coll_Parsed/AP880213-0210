Oil prices have closed out the week on a 
negative note pulled lower by technical factors and slumping 
prices in Europe 
Traders were also more interested in selling than buying because 
they do not want to be holding contracts over the threeday 
weekend The market will be closed Monday in observance of the 
Presidents Day holiday 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange contracts for March 
delivery of West Texas Intermediate the benchmark US crude 
closed at 1675 per 42gallon barrel down 36 cents from Thursday 
Among refined products wholesale heating oil contracts fell 
075 cent to 4660 cents per gallon while wholesale unleaded 
gasoline sold for 4628 cents per gallon down 037 cent 
Andrew Lebow an analyst at the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc 
said he did not see any fundamental reasons for Fridays declines 
It was really pretty much a technical market all day today 
he said 
He added that crude having failed to break above 1775 
earlier this week appeared to be on the downward path in its 
yearlong range between 1575 and 1775 
Another factor pressuring crude prices was an overnight decline 
in North Sea Brent crude on the London exchange said Jayne Ball a 
broker at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc 
She said the holiday also played a part 
Traders all closed their books and said Forget this 
stuff Ms Ball said
