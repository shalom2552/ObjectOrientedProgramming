An American serviceman crossed the 
border today one of more than 20 Americans who remained on the job 
in south Lebanon despite the kidnapping of Lt Col William R 
Higgins a day earlier 
UN spokesman Timor Goksel said there were no plans to change 
UN regulations that restrict Americans to the border and 
headquarters areas for most duties and require armed escorts for 
travel beyond those areas 
Higgins told UN officials he had full authority from the 
American government to travel wherever he wished according to 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
Goksel said 16 American servicemen and a halfdozen civilians 
continued to work in Lebanon most of them staying overnight at 
headquarters in Naqoura to follow the search for Higgins 
One officer who identified himself as an American working for 
the UN Truce Supervision Organization UNTSO was seen crossing 
into Lebanon But he refused to give his name or answer a 
reporters questions while waiting for Israeli guards to open the 
blue steel gate at the border checkpoint 
Other American personnel reached by telephone at UN 
headquarters in Naqoura and in Jerusalem referred reporters to the 
Pentagon saying they were not permitted to speak 
Higgins 43 a Marine officer from Danville Ky was new on the 
job taking up his post Jan 8 as commander of 75 unarmed observers 
from 16 nations He was kidnapped Wednesday while returning from 
the southern port city of Tyre where he met with a Shiite Moslem 
political leader 
Asked why Americans were still working in southern Lebanon in 
view of recent abductions Goksel said American observers had been 
under a travel ban since 1985 Higgins felt he couldnt abide by 
these restrictions He assured us there would be no problems 
Goksel said 
Higgins felt that as chief he should be out with his men and 
know what they are doing he said noting Higgins commanded a 
force made up largely of nonAmericans 
Goksel indicated the Americans were safe because they are not 
serving the United States but under the UN flag 
The border area is also more friendly for Americans because it 
is controlled by Israeli troops and allied Christian militiamen 
But Higgins was traveling outside this zone when he was taken 
In general Goksel said Americans in the observer corps have 
been doing headquarters duties and working in observation posts 
along the Lebanese side of the border with Israel 
Goksel said one of the main functions of the observer group was 
to maintain contacts with local leaders and Higgins visit to Amal 
representatives was an initial courtesy call arranged through the 
Tyre UN office 
Until now we have always felt safe in Tyre Goksel said 
Higgins the first UN peacekeeper to be kidnapped in Lebanon 
was traveling alone and unarmed in a UN vehicle following 
another UN vehicle with two observers a Dane and an American 
Goksel said UN troops from Fiji Ghana Ireland and Finland 
were leading the search for Higgins 
He said the mainstream Shiite militia Amal was heavily involved 
in searches outside the UN zone They are reporting to us but 
we are not coordinating with them he said 
UN officials said they were encouraged by the fact that the 
militia was involved noting there had been no active searches when 
Westerners had been abducted elsewhere in Lebanon
