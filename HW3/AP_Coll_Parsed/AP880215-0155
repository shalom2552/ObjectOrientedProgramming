Supporters of a presidential primary for 
Washington state said Monday they fear the measure has been killed 
by pressure from the two political parties and will die without 
coming to a vote 
The bill which would allow voters to decide whether to scrap 
the complicated caucus system remained bottled up in the House 
Rules Committee on Monday 
The two main backers of a primary Republican Secretary of State 
Ralph Munro and Democratic Rep Ruth Fisher charged that House 
Speaker Joe King a Democrat was holding up the bill at the behest 
of Democratic state officials 
Both Munro and Mrs Fisher said reports that former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson may win Washingtons Republican caucuses 
on March 8 show how easily the caucus system can be manipulated 
Said Mrs Fisher If Robertson wins you can bet well have a 
presidential primary created next year 
Mrs Fisher said Washingtons caucus turnout is usually no more 
than 3 percent of the registered voters but that a primary would 
easily attract 50 percent 
Munro said more people attend a Seattle Seahawks game than their 
precinct caucuses
