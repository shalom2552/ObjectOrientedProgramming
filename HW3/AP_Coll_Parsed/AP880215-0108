The Senate majority leader called today 
for his colleagues to scrap a plan to meet privately during the 
impeachment trial of Gov Evan Mecham 
The decision to allow for closed meetings had been criticized by 
Mechams lawyer and had touched off protests and editorials from 
news organizations 
It has become evident after several days of comments regarding 
the adopted Court of Impeachment rules from both the public and the 
press that the intent of our actions has been misinterpreted 
Robert Usdane said in a letter to Senate President Carl Kunasek and 
Minority Leader Alan Stephens 
It appears to me that the benefits to the Senate would be 
significantly outweighed by the detriments to the process he 
added 
Usdane like Mecham a Republican suggested that the rules be 
changed to require that all deliberations in public and to either 
ban secret meetings or require a majority vote before any closed 
meeting 
Kunasek declined to say whether he would support the change But 
several rankandfile Republicans said they favored it and Stephens 
said he believed his caucus would go along with it 
A twothirds vote is needed to change the rules 
Usdane said deliberating in the open will erase any question 
as to the fairness and honesty of the outcome of the Senate vote 
Mecham is accused by a House resolution of having broken laws by 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan lending 80000 to his car 
dealership and obstructing justice Mecham who also faces a May 17 
recall election and a criminal indictment over the 350000 loan 
has said repeatedly that he is innocent of any wrongdoing 
Rules approved Thursday by the Senate require a closed 
conference at the request of any single senator
