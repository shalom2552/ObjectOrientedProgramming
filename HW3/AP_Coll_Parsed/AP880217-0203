A television weatherman had some 
explaining to do after a windbreaker with a container of marijuana 
in its pocket blew out of his helicopter and was recovered by some 
junior high school students 
Jerry Foster of NBC affiliate KPNX in Phoenix said he found a 
canister of the drug Tuesday while filming near the Salt River 
earlier in the day 
He said he made arrangements to turn the marijuana over to 
Maricopa County Sheriffs deputies but first he had to stop by the 
school to film preparations for a flagraising ceremony so he 
stuck in it in his jacket 
Foster an honorary deputy said he didnt notice the black 
nylon windbreaker missing until he was already at the sheriffs 
office 
Apparently the jacket just blew out of the helicopter I 
never did see it go he said 
Ironically the jacket was found by two students from nearby 
Mesquite Jr High which is sponsoring a Just Say No to drugs 
program this week They turned it over to Gilbert police 
The Gilbert police officer wanted me to explain and I did 
Foster said He called the sheriffs department and they backed 
me up 
Sgt Jay Ellison said Foster reported finding a small canister 
of marijuana a 32caliber pistol and some other items when he 
landed to change film near the river 
Foster said he placed the canister in the jacket so it wouldnt 
spill 
Gilbert Police Sgt Steven Olsen said the marijuana would be 
turned over to the county
