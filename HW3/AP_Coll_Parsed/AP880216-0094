The discovery of two species of the 
daddylonglegs insect family in Edgewood County Park may block a 
proposed 18hole golf course 
Both species are called the Edgewood Park harvestman of 
Sitalcina minor They live only in serpentine rock formations in 
the parks hills and several conservationists want the habitate to 
be preserved 
Constructing a golf course would wipe out the whole harvestmen 
populations said Thomas F Briggs a science teacher at San 
Francisco Lowell High School 
These are about the smallest daddy longlegs in the world he 
added 
Briggs discovered one of the species in 1983 and the other in 
1985 Both have eight legs and bright orangered bodies that 
measure about 1 millimeter Unlike spiders daddylonglegs do not 
spin webs 
Along with Darrell Ubick an entomologist Briggs has submitted 
a proposal to the US Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the 
species discovered in 1983 be declared a federally protected 
creature which could halt any development of their only known 
habitat 
San Mateo County purchased the 468acre site in 1980 from the 
state and has been attempting to build a golf course there for 
several years 
This little spider is just another ploy to keep from having a 
golf course said Barbara Kootz of nearby San Carlos a golfer 
and leader of prodevelopment interests in the area
