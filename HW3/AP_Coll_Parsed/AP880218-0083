Boris N Yeltsin the outspoken former protege of 
Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev was ousted from the ruling 
Politburo today Tass reported 
Two rising stars in the Communist Party hierarchy were named 
nonvoting Politburo members the official Soviet news agency said 
The policymaking Central Committee made the changes after 
Gorbachev told the party leadership that his efforts to modernize 
the economy and Soviet society did not constitute a retreat from 
socialism 
We are not retreating one step from socialism 
MarxismLeninism everything which has been won and created by the 
people Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying 
We are striving in the present conditions to revive the 
Leninist look of the new system to rid it of the accumulations and 
deformations of everything that shackled society and prevented it 
from realizing the potential of socialism in full measure he 
said 
Tass said the Central Commiittee meeting freed Comrade BN 
Yeltsin from his duties as a candidate member of the Politburo 
Yeltsin 57 was brought into the ruling body by Gorbachev in 
February 1986 and named Moscow party boss But he fell from favor 
last fall when he complained to the Central Committee at its last 
meeting that an entrenched bureaucracy had stalled Gorbachevs 
efforts to modernize Soviet society 
Yeltsin earlier had been removed from his party post in the 
Soviet capital but was given a ministerial job in the governments 
construction bureaucracy leaving his political future in doubt 
The move to drive him from power was seen as an indication the 
party remains unwilling to tolerate criticism in key areas despite 
Gorbachevs program of glasnost or openness which has 
encouraged freer expression of ideas 
He said his program is instead designed to root out dogmatism 
and bureaucracy 
Tass said Georgy Razumovsky 52 a Gorbachev protege who has 
been handling party personnel matters for almost two years would 
take a seat as a nonvoting member of the Politburo He has been a 
secretary of the Central Committee a key post in the Communist 
Party apparatus 
Also named to candidate or nonvoting membership was Yuri 
Maslyukov 50 who this month was named chairman of the State 
Planning Committee the body that historically has controlled the 
nations planned economy 
The party chief acknowledged that his program of 
perestroika or restructuring has caused some confusion 
Perestroika seeks to decentralize control of industry and make 
plant managers responsible for their own products in an effort to 
streamline production improve quality and make consumer goods 
available to the Soviet public 
The Tass account said some people have questioned whether the 
new unaccustomed forms of economic management and social life 
actually constitute a revision of fundamental MarxistLeninist 
teaching 
The awareness has been established now that perestroika is an 
objectively necessary stage of the development of Soviet society 
whose essence is a transition to its new qualitative state 
Gorbachev said 
On Wednesday Yegor K Ligachev outlined plans for an overhaul 
of the countrys school system saying the rigid and centralized 
Soviet bureaucracy must ease its control over schools to allow more 
flexibility at the local level 
Ligachev is considered to rank second behind Gorbachev 
Western reporters are not allowed to attend the meeting of the 
more than 300 members of the policymaking body The committee is 
composed of top national officials regional and local party 
bosses and Communists from the armed forces government 
ministries industry and agriculture
