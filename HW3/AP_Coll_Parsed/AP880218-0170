Leukemia victim Stephen L Chapman says it 
may be best that his younger brother rejected his request to donate 
critically needed bone marrow for a transplant 
The younger brother Randy J Chapman 31 ran away from home 14 
years ago and now lives on the streets of Miami earning money as a 
test subject for medical experiments 
He was a last resort for a match Being on the streets that 
long he could be sick or on dope Steve Chapman 38 said 
Wednesday Theres no telling what hes got Maybe its better 
that he didnt agree 
Steve Chapman hospitalized at St Vincent Hospital in 
Indianapolis was urged by his physician to locate the brother 
because blood types from other relatives were not compatible for a 
marrow transplant His wife two teenage children a sister and 
another brother had all volunteered 
I just had a feeling that he wouldnt do it anyway said 
Steve Chapman of Oolitic 
Chapmans wife Cathy wrote letters to a Miami newspaper and 
called the FBI the Internal Revenue Service Rep Frank McCloskey 
DInd and others she thought could help locate the brother 
He was found this week but Randy Chapman told the Miami News 
that he wanted nothing to do with his brother 
Im not even going to consider it said Randy Chapman If 
I sound cruel well thats the way I feel Im not a very forgiving 
person If he dies he dies 
Chapman on leave from his job as a heavy assembly operator at 
the RCA plant in Bloomington was diagnosed in December as having 
leukemia 
Chapman said his disease is in remission and he hopes to leave 
the hospital next week He said his physician is considering a 
treatment used when no compatible donors are available The 
procedure involves removing the victims bone marrow and treating 
it to remove leukemic cells before returning it 
Chapman said he hadnt talked to his younger brother in 16 years 
and wasnt disappointed that he refused to help 
He said he is not sure what caused the rift between the 
brothers who grew up in Bedford in southern Indiana playing 
basketball and fishing together 
He said his brother got into that longhaired stuff before 
he left Indiana 
We tried to figure out what he was mad about We just figured 
he had a chip on his shoulder the elder brother said Randy 
was always a loner He got worse after Dad died in 1967 
Im glad hes OK Id like to see him Chapman added
