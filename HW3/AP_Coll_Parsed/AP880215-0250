Israels consumer price index rose by 16 
percent in January slightly higher than predicted the Central 
Bureau of Statistics announced Monday 
In December the inflation rate stood at 13 percent and for 
all of 1987 it reached 161 percent the lowest in 15 years 
Finance Minister Moshe Nissim called on employers unions and 
workers to show restraint in wage negotiations in order to slow 
down inflation 
The index is relatively high and we have to work for a lower 
figure Nissim told Israel radio But there is no doubt that if 
want to reach a desirable level a European level it doesnt work 
at once 
The price increase was largely fueled by rising prices for 
fruits and vegetables The consumer price index measures the change 
in retail prices for a basket of goods and services 
In 1985 the government launched a sweeping austerity program to 
curb tripledigit inflation and reduce a 750 million budget 
deficit 
The reforms helped reduce inflation from a record 4449 percent 
in 1984 to 197 percent in 1986
