A federal judge Tuesday reset the start of 
Teamsters President Jackie Pressers trial on labor racketeering 
and embezzlement charges to July 12 the second time the case has 
been delayed 
Presser 60 is accused of creating a 700000 scheme in which 
people were paid for doing no work at Teamsters Local 507 where he 
is secretarytreasurer He was charged in 1986 with two counts of 
labor racketeering one of embezzlement and two of filing false 
reports with the government 
Two codefendants Harold Friedman and Anthony Hughes also are 
to stand trial then Friedman is a Teamsters vice president and 
Local 507 president and Hughes is the locals recording secretary 
At an informal session with lawyers in the case US District 
Judge George W White said he was rescheduling the trial date not 
knowing what Mr Pressers condition may be Friedman and Hughes 
should be ready to go to trial whether or not Presser is 
ready he said 
Pending legal matters caused the original trial date Aug 10 of 
last year to be delayed The trial was reset to Monday but was 
delayed because of Pressers health problems and a matter pending 
before the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals pertaining to defense 
discovery of evidence 
White said he expects the trial to start on the assigned date 
this time unless the court of appeals tells me differently 
Three of Pressers predecessors Roy Williams Jimmy Hoffa and 
Dave Beck were convicted of federal crimes after becoming 
president of the union and resigned their posts Another 
predecessor Frank Fitzsimmons never had a police record and died 
while in office 
Presser assumed leadership of the 16 millionmember union April 
21 1983 when a Teamsters executive board allowed him to complete 
the fiveyear term of Williams He was reelected in May 1986 a 
few days after he was indicted 
Last year Presser underwent surgery for removal of a lung 
tumor but his doctors have since declared him free of cancer 
Chemotherapy and radiation treatments however have caused him 
health problems and he is recuperating in Phoenix said John R 
Climaco Pressers lead defense lawyer

undergo a physical examination next week at Georgetown University 
Medical School with an endocrinologist the Justice Department has
