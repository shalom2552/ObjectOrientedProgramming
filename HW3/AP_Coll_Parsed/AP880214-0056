A Tanzania Airways pilot tricked 
four hijackers into believing he had flown them to Kenya then 
landed his plane at a Tanzanian airport where troops overpowered 
and arrested the young men Sunday 
Capt Dominic Ngandile also managed to send a secret distress 
signal to the Dar es Salaam airport which turned off its terminal 
and runway lights making it look like a small Kenyan airport 
authorities said 
After landing the pilot stalled the assailants telling them 
they would have to wait until daylight to refuel the plane Just 
before dawn army troops stormed the plane and arrested the 
hijackers 
The hijackers stabbed Ngandile in the neck and hands after they 
realized they had been tricked His copilot Christopher Mnika 
suffered cuts on his hands The injuries were not serious said 
airline and security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
Among the 70 passengers on the Saturday night flight were two 
senior government officials Home Affairs Minister Muhidin Kimario 
and Hamad Rashid Mohamed deputy minister for finance economic 
affairs and planning None of the passengers was hurt 
Officials said the four hijackers arrested Sunday made no 
political statements or claimed any affiliations and that their 
only demand was to be flown to London 
The Boeing 737 carried a crew of six on the internal flight 
between Dar es Salaam the capital and Kilimanjaro a northern 
town near the Kenya border and the site of Mount Kilimanjaro 
Africas highest mountain

announced that the flight had been hijacked and that they were 
going to London via Addis Ababa Ethiopia and Egypt

Ngandile told the hijackers that the plane did not have enough 
fuel to reach Addis Ababa and suggested he refuel instead at a 
small airport at Ludwar Kenya the sources said 
The hijackers agreed 
Instead of heading for Kenya Ngandile flew the plane in a wide 
arc and headed back to Dar es Salaam After he sent the secret 
distress signal airport officials turned off some airport lights 
The Boeing 737 landed about 1030 pm and taxied to the old Dar 
es Salaam terminal

In 1984 four men claiming to be members of a group called the 
Peoples Democratic Movement of Tanzania hijacked a Tanzania 
Airways jet on an internal flight from Mwanza a Lake Victoria 
trading center in western Tanzania to Dar es Salaam 
The hijackers demanded the resignation of then President Julius 
Nyerere blaming his socialist policies for Tanzanias deplorable 
economic condition 
They forced the pilot to fly the plane to London where the four 
men surrendered peacefully The Tanzanians were tried and convicted 
and sentenced to prison terms in the United Kingdom 
Nyerere retired from the presidency in 1985 but still holds the 
most powerful political position in the East Africa country as 
leader of the ruling party
