Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said Tuesday 
his coalition will survive a split over President Kurt Waldheims 
conduct in World War II but the issue is isolating Austria from 
the rest of the world 
The Socialist chancellor in coalition with a conservative party 
that supported Waldheim for the presidency also repeated his 
threat to resign if the Waldheim affair is not resolved 
Waldheim said he will sue Der Spiegel a West German magazine 
that printed a copy of a document purportedly linking him to 
deportation of civilians in the Balkans where he was a lieutenant 
in the German army The magazine has retracted the story and said 
the document probably was a fake 
In London Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain will 
reopen the files on six commandos taken prisoner in 1944 on the 
Germanoccupied Greek island of Alimnia 
We have taken the allegations concerning Dr Waldheim very 
seriously particularly those concerning British servicemen she 
told the House of Commons in a written reply to a question 
An international commission of historians that investigated 
Waldheims past said in its report that it could not prove a 
connection between him and the commandos but found the initial 
W on transcripts of interviews with the six men The report 
suggested that Waldheim knew the Gestapo shot captured commandos 
After meeting with Deputy Chancellor Alois Mock head of the 
conservative Peoples Party Vranitzky told reporters We have 
clearly affirmed the intention to have this government continue 
His statement seemed designed to quell speculation that 
divisions over Waldheim might dissolve the coalition 
The chancellor runs the government and the presidency is largely 
ceremonial The Socialists are the senior partner in the coalition 
with the Peoples Party which backed the former UN 
secretarygeneral for president in 1986 
Vranitzky criticized Waldheim for what he called failure to take 
a clear stand on key points of the report by the commission of 
historians The 202page document said Waldheim was in close 
proximity to Nazi atrocities must have known about them and did 
nothing to stop them 
In a televised speech Monday the president said he would not 
resign and asked Austrians to unite behind him 
Mock one of Waldheims staunchest backers said Tuesday the 
presidents speech offered dialogue and said clearly he is 
conscious of his integral role 
But Vranitzky repeated his threat to resign saying he can only 
lead in good conscience if the working conditions are such to 
allow me to assume these obligations in a responsible way 
Vranitzky also voiced concern about the impact of the affair on 
Austrias tourism economy and its relations with other Western 
countries 
Major US travel operators are flying Americans to Budapest 
rather than Vienna he said adding Our business people cannot 
be easy about that 
Referring to Austrian efforts to establish closer trade links 
with the European Community Vranitzky noted We cant be 
indifferent to the fact that in the whole year 1987 only two 
government leaders visited us 
The Soviet and Liechtenstein premiers were in Austria last year 
What I really think is necessary for everybody in this country 
and therefore also for the president is to try to emerge from 
this isolation out of this selfchosen inner emigration 
Vranitzky said 
Waldheim spokesman Gerold Christian said it was unclear exactly 
on what charges Waldheim planned to sue Der Spiegel Under Austrian 
law the president must instruct state prosecutors to begin any 
legal proceedings on his behalf 
Der Spiegel published in its Feb 1 edition a copy of a telegram 
allegedly linking Waldheim to the deportation of more than 4000 
civilians from the Kozara region in Yugoslavia in 1942 
A copy of the document was sold to Der Spiegel by a Yugoslav 
journalist The original could not be found Der Spiegel in its 
current issue apologized for publishing what was most probably a 
fake 
In May Waldheim instructed state prosecutors to sue World 
Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman for asserting that 
Waldheim was part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine 
Late last year Waldheim ordered prosecutors to sue the Austrian 
magazine Wiener which published a supplement on the Waldheim 
affair 
A poll conducted for the conservative Vienna daily Die Presse 
reflected rising public pressure for Waldheim to resign The 
telephone poll was based on interviews with 440 Austrians 
Fortysix percent of those who responded were against 
resignation and 37 were in favor Two weeks ago a similar poll 
said 72 percent of those surveyed opposed Waldheims resignation 
Fortyfive percent of those polled said they wouldnt vote for 
Waldheim if an election were held on Sunday while 34 percent said 
they would
