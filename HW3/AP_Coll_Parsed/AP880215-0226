EDITORS NOTE A sharp drop in boxoffice sales is putting a 
lot of French movie theaters out of business in a country where 
cinema is a national passion Film directors say theyre keeping 
busy but in the words of one Any director who shuns television 
is a dead man

Film directors here who regard reports of the 
death of French cinema as highly exaggerated have not slowed their 
pace They make a movie every three days as many as the Americans 
Crisis crisis mocks Claude Lelouch who is spending 10 
million on a JeanPaul Belmondo film he wants to premiere in 
Madison Square Garden All this whining is ridiculous 
JeanJacques Annaud another Frenchman with an Oscar laughs 
You think there is a crisis Try to find a cameraman Or an 
actor Theyre all busy and their prices go up every day 
Talk of crisis followed a year of mediocre films and a 20 
percent drop in boxoffice sales in France A revolution in French 
television means six channels show 1200 films a year Video 
rentals are up 
Directors say that is a challenge to make spectacular or 
imaginative films to lure couch potatoes back into theaters In any 
case they add television is just another branch of the business 
This is a problem of theater owners not filmmakers Annaud 
says I may be sad that people see my work on a little box 
instead of a screen but I dont feel Ill lose my job if cinemas 
close 
Few directors seem endangered in a country where the film 
industry is a national obsession French filmmakers in a nation of 
55 million earn 10 percent of world boxoffice receipts 
The range is wide 
Francois Truffautdied in 1986 but every other major director of 
the 1950s New Wave is still making movies Claude Chabrol does two 
a year Eric Rohmer at 67 works hard on tiny budgets 
JeanLuc Godard an aging rebel loved mainly by critics just 
brought out Soigne Ta Droite Watch Your Right a metaphysical 
meander in the mind of a director trying to make a film to order 
At the other extreme hot young comers like Luc Besson 
Subway and Leos Carax Mauvais Sang or Bad Blood are 
trying to solidify success from their early films 
Louis Malle after slowing down in the United States came home 
to make a smash hit Au Revoir les Enfants Goodbye 
Children about kids deported by the Nazis 
Bernard Tavernier finished with Round Midnight returned to 
do La Passion Beatrice a hard saga of incest and violence set 
in a corner of 14th century France 
At the Cannes Film Festival Maurice Pialats Sous le Soleil 
de Satan Under Satans Sun was the first French entry to win 
the bestfilm award since Lelouchs A Man and a Woman 20 years 
ago 
Claude Berris backtoback films about the disappearing French 
peasantry Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources were 
successes even in US shopping mall cinemas So were Diva and 
Betty Blue by JeanJacques Beneix 
There is no reason not to be optimistic says Serge Tubiana 
editor of the prestigious Cahiers du Cinema Some fine films are 
being made 
Plenty of money is available Tubiana says but a new breed of 
businessmenproducers do not know how to spend it He says it will 
take time for television executives to learn to wield their power 
For example no one would touch Coline Serreaus Trois Hommes 
et un Couffin It was a smash when someone finally did As 
Three Men and a Baby the US remake grossed 70 million in 
1987 
The state works hard to assure a steady crop of filmmakers Its 
influential academy the Institute for Higher Cinema Studies turns 
away three times more students than it accepts 
The tendency among younger people is toward the classical the 
old styles says Solveig Anspach an IDHEC student I dont see 
any worry about the future 
She said her class is 40 percent women a level that few would 
have believed possible a decade ago 
It is not easy for a young director to find backing but if 
you have a good idea and you are determined you can do it said 
Camille de Casabianca whose Pekin Central won praise 
Any director with a screenplay can apply for an advance from the 
statesupported National Cinema Center which takes a cut of 
boxoffice receipts Private money is often available 
But successful filmmakers like Annaud prefer to cross borders 
breaking out of the limited French market 
His Name of the Rose was based on an Italian novel with 
English actors and German money The script was written in English 
and French He shot the film in English and dubbed it for France 
I would much rather spend 25 million for the international 
market than 3 million for only France he says The risk is 
less because of the percentages 
Crossing cultures can be risky Annaud won an Academy Award for 
foreign films with Black and White in Color But the film 
ridiculed colonialism and it flopped among the sensitive French 
Annaud is unperturbed by a dearth of French stars Directors 
fight over the bearlike Gerard Depardieu But Annauds next film 
stars a real bear Called lOurs The Bear it looks at 
hunting from the viewpoint of a Kodiak cub 
Lelouch corraled Belmondo fresh from a hit theater run in 
Kean He plays a 50yearold adventurer the worlds ninth 
richest man who grew up in a circus and trots the globe taming 
lions and women 
It is called lItineraire dun Enfant Gate meaning the 
Journeys of a Spoiled Brat 
The director who not coincidentally just turned 50 wants to 
present the film on a 7500squarefoot screen at the Bercy sports 
complex in Paris Then for America at Madison Square Garden 
We have to find new limits new ideas that become possible as 
the technology develops Lelouch says I hope in my lifetime I 
can film the picture that keeps turning in my head 
He pursued his theme 
There is always something better bigger more interesting to 
do I can imagine films being shown all over the world at the same 
time on a sort of payTV system which would earn enough to allow 
us to do anything 
You have to adapt and improve with the means Any director 
today who shuns television is a dead man 
Annaud a different sort of filmmaker agreed with Lelouch 
Where is the conflict he reflected It is like concerts 
and records Why do some people go to a concert hall instead of 
buying a compact disc In the end it is the same
