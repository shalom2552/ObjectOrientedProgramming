Republican presidential candidates their 
prospects riding on the decision of New Hampshire primary voters 
head into a final day of campaigning after a debate in which the 
alsorans pounced on the frontrunner in an 11thhour effort to 
change the odds 
Sign it Pete du Pont said to Kansas Sen Bob Dole as the 
former Delaware governor thrust a notax pledge in his face at one 
point in the Sunday night debate 
Id have to read it first snapped Dole reviving an old 
dispute over the INF treaty with Vice President George Bush 
Maybe George would sign it 
Bush was the target of jabs from Kemp and du Pont on arms 
control and prospects for Soviet withdrawal of its troops from 
Afghanistan 
Taking advantage of their last opportunity to impress voters 
before the polls open on Tuesday the GOP contenders were spending 
the day at coffee shops shopping malls and service club meetings 
The latest polls indicated a BushDole fight for first place in 
the Republican primary and du Pont Rep Jack Kemp and former 
evangelist Pat Robertson fighting for third place 
An ABC NewsWashington Post poll released Sunday night said Dole 
had the support of 31 percent of likely Republican voters while 
Bush was backed by 28 percent Kemp was the choice of 13 percent 
and du Pont and Robertson of 11 percent each 
A CBS News survey had it Dole 31 Bush 30 Kemp 11 Robertson 
and du Pont 10 each 
When Bush said he expected the Soviets to go forward with a 
promised troop withdrawal from Afghanistan Kemp said heatedly 
We have a State Department that has run amok on this issue 
Wait and see said Bush Dont fight progress when you see 
it Dont be afraid 
Bush tried to close out the argument saying I dont jump 
away from the president when the going gets tough and then added 
Give peace a chance which brought another outburst from Kemp 
You should be embarrassed to use give peace a chance he 
said Were the party of peace 
After the debate Kemp appeared in the press room to say 
Republicans should be saying give freedom a chance 
Kemp said the debate showed were looking at the Old Guard of 
the Republican Party versus the future of a party devoted to hope 
opportunity and freedom 
Du Pont also appeared in the press room to press his contention 
that Dole would opt for a tax increase to deal with the budget 
deficit 
We gave Bob Dole a chance to take the tax pledge he said 
The vice president made it clear he wasnt giving up no matter 
what happens on Tuesday Here I stand warts and all he said 
recalling the words of Abraham Lincoln He said hes not the best 
of orators but added Dont take that for a lack of passion 
My work isnt done yet he said 
Robertson appeared to startle his fellow debaters when he said 
the Soviets have placed missiles in Cuba He said his source was 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Somehow in all this brilliant negotiation which these 
gentlemen are so proud of they left that out of the treaty 
Robertson said And it seems like to me nukes pointing at the 
United States are more vital to our security than nukes pointing to 
Europe 
After the debate Marc Nuttle Robertsons campaign manager 
said the candidate was referring to missile delivery systems not 
warheads He said the information did not come directly from the 
Foreign Relations committee but thats where some of the 
information was compiled 
He refused to name the source of the information 
On AIDS Dole questioned the value of routine testing for the 
disease 
Lets say you test false positive and the word gets out you 
have the AIDS virus and you dont have it he said Weve got 
people who are suffering This is one issue we shouldnt 
politicize 
Kemp immediately jumped in to say We need routine testing
