For the first time in more than 50 years Paris is 
celebrating the unparalleled genius of Edgar Degas the 19th 
century artist whose graceful ballerinas and busy race track scenes 
have long been synonymous with impressionism 
More than 300 paintings drawings monotypes pastels 
watercolors photographs and sculpture by the man who once said he 
wanted to die illustrious and unknown are on show at the Grand 
Palais until May 16 
Critics say Degas got his wish In his lifetime he was famous 
for the sweetfaced ballet dancers in crinoline tutus he portrayed 
on stage under the lights in rehearsal at rest and exercising at 
the barre 
At odd angles and sometimes off center the dancers were 
experiments in perspective and composition that differentiated 
Degas from his impressionist contemporaries In 1912 five years 
before his death Danseuses a la Barre Dancers at the 
Barre sold for 430000 francs then one of the highest prices 
on record 
But Degas did not consider himself the painter of ballerinas 
For him they were just a pretext for painting pretty fabric and 
capturing movement 
Funded by a 15 million grant from United Technologies Corp 
the exhibition will travel to the Museum of Fine Arts in Ottawa 
Canada from June 16 to Aug 28 and the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in New York from Sept 27 to Jan 8 1989 
More comprehensive than previous Degas shows this one features 
little known works rarely seen in public and which reveal an artist 
who was misogynist antiSemitic and voyeuristic someone critics 
said liked to peep through keyholes 
One of Degas favorite subjects was women at their toilette and 
he painted them tirelessly throughout a 60yearcareer Bathing in 
the tub stepping into the tub or climbing out draped over the tub 
or sitting on its edge washing drying and combing their hair 
Degas nudes were ongoing experiments in form and color 
perspective and technique 
Early in his career he used oils almost exclusively But at the 
age of 36 his vision began to decline and he turned to pastels 
watercolors and later charcoal By 1912 he was completely blind 
Until now nudes had always adopted studied poses Degas 
said in 1886 after the last impressionist show My women are 
simple people concerned only with what theyre doing Heres one 
washing her feet Its as though you were looking through the 
keyhole 
There were other simple folk in Degas paintings thickwaisted 
and perspiring laundresses jockeys on horseback cafe singers 
belting out the latest tunes hat makers with swollen pinpricked 
fingers and naked prostitutes shown in the picture Party for 
the Boss 
But there were also numerous renditions of Degas stuffy 
middleclass milieu The son of a banker he painted the stiff 
portraits of bored looking gentlemen in dark suits and their 
buttonedup wives 
Degas was a notorious antiSemite who broke with many of his 
closest friends including Camille Pisarro and the wealthy Halevy 
family during the Dreyfus affair A firm believer in the guilt of 
Alfred Dreyfus the Jewish captain convicted of treason he once 
kicked out of his studio a woman model who casually mentioned the 
possibility of Dreyfus innocence 
Le General Mellinet et le Grand Rabbin Astruc General 
Mellinet and Rabbi Astruc a small format portrait also caused 
controversy because of the unflattering way in which Degas 
transformed Astrucs fine features 
Degas blinded by Judeophobia sacked his divine model 
replaced a miniature mouth by fat sensual lips Gabriel Astruc 
the rabbis brother said at the time 
This painting is not a work of art Astruc said Its a 
pogrom 
One of the most striking early masterpieces on show is 
Portrait de Famille also known as La Famille Bellelli 
The Bellelli Family 185867 Though the subject was family 
members he supposedly liked critics have long wondered at the 
paintings surpising absence of warmth and affection 
Another early painting unlike any of his later works is 
Interior or the Rape 186869 showing a bedroom scene between 
a young woman with bare shoulders kneeling on the floor her back 
to a tall bearded man watching her intently 
The show catalog refers to the work as one of Degas most 
mysterious highlighting the difficulty the artist had with 
women 
As Edouard Manet put it in a letter to Berthe Morisot He 
isnt natural He is incapable of loving a woman He cant even 
tell her He cant do anything
