Sen Bob Dole of Kansas is likely to win 
the Republican nomination for president according to former United 
Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick 
About 750 Republicans attended the state GOPs annual Lincoln 
Day festivities in Kansas City over the weekend where Kirkpatrick 
was the keynote speaker 
I dont have any crystal ball Kirkpatrick said I know 
predictions are uncertain If I had to choose I would say its 
likely it would be Bob Dole It can change I think today thats 
the way it looks 
Much of the discussion centered on the chances of Dole and Vice 
President George Bush the top GOP presidential contenders 
Unlike Lincoln Day weekends in past presidential election years 
there was a generally harmonious atmosphere among Republicans 
although there was no consensus candidate

The Boston Herald calling Republican presidential 
hopeful Jack Kemp a man of genuine vision has endorsed the New 
York congressman in his effort to win the GOP nomination 
All the Republicans have much to recommend them the Herald 
said in its lead editorial Monday one day before the New Hampshire 
primary But in terms of ideas philosophy and potential for 
presidential leadership we are persuaded that Kemp would make a 
better occupant of the White House than any of his rivals 
The editorial noted that Kemp was not the favorite in the 
firstinthe nation presidential primary Vice President George 
Bush and Kansas Sen Bob Dole are favored to finish higher in the 
voting 
Although it looks like the New Hampshire primary is a fight 
between Bush and Dole for first place we hope Kemp will do well 
enough to stay in the race the editorial said 
Last week the newspaper endorsed Massachusetts Gov Michael S 
Dukakis in his race for the Democratic nomination
