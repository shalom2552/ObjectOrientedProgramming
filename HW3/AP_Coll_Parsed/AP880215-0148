A threeweekold boy underwent more than 10 hours of heart 
transplant surgery in Pittsburgh Monday and a weekold infant was 
upgraded from critical to serious condition 24 hours after he was 
given a new heart in California 
Both infants were born with hypoplastic leftheart syndrome a 
lethal underdevelopment of the heart 
Jonathan Stowe born Jan 25 entered the operating room at 
Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh around midnight and emerged at 
1015 am said hospital spokeswoman Sue Cardillo He was the 
youngest heart transplant patient at that hospital 
At Loma Linda Calif Baby Christoffer son of a US Air Force 
family received a new heart in a 5hour operation performed Sunday 
by Dr Leonard Bailey the surgeon who transplanted a baboon heart 
into the infant girl known as Baby Fae in 1984 
Christoffers condition was upgraded this morning from 
critical to serious said Dick Schaefer spokesman for Loma Linda 
University Medical Center the hospital 60 miles east of Los 
Angeles 
The boy had been in Loma Lindas neonatal intensive care unit 
for six days three of them on life support before the transplant 
surgery 
In both cases the identity of the donor was not released And 
Christoffers family asked that no more information be released 
Schaefer said 
Doctors in Pittsburgh could not immediately assess the chances 
that Jonathans operation would succeed said Miss Cardillo 
Jonathan son of Tabatha and David Stowe of Beaver Falls Pa 
was in critical condition which is normal immediately after 
transplant surgery she said 
The operation was a very delicate procedure to perform said 
Miss Cardillo Right now the major concern is with overall 
function of the organ Hell be monitored very closely over the 
next several days 
The Stowes both 20 have one other son Chad 3 Stowe is 
unemployed 
The youngest transplant patient at Childrens before Jonathan 
was a 24dayold boy from Wyoming who received a new liver in July 
1986 Hes doing well today Ms Cardillo said 
Christoffer was the 13th baby under four months of age to 
undergo human heart transplant surgery at Loma Linda Of the 12 
previous infants nine have survived including Paul Holc the 
worlds youngest heart transplant patient who was given a new organ 
hours after birth
