Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said 
Tuesday that harsher laws are needed to combat the 19yearold 
communist insurrection and recalled that he asked earlier for the 
death penalty to be restored 
But he said said the rebellion was not at the stage where a 
state of national emergency was needed while President Corazon 
Aquino was quoted as saying suggestions she would impose martial 
law were ridiculous 
Ramos noted at a news conference that 18 months ago he 
recommended that the government enact tougher laws to help the 
military fight the New Peoples Army These included lengthening 
the time suspected rebels could be held without charge and 
restoring the death penalty for heinous crimes such as treason 
and rebellion 
After a thorough assessment of the insurgency situation and 
the efficacy of the various government countermeasures and 
programs the position of the Defense Department and military is 
that the present situation is not I repeat not of such gravity 
as to make compelling a declaration of a state of emergencythe 
defense chief said 
There is no need for the public especially the international 
audience to be put in a state of alarm and apprehension over this 
issue 
Ramos was apparently trying to spike widespread speculation that 
the military was pressuring the government to declare martial law 
Sen Ernesto Maceda chairman of the Senate defense committee 
told reporters he discussed the issue Tuesday with the president 
and she assured him she would not declare a state of emergency and 
never really seriously considered it 
Cory even described the idea of resorting to martial rule as 
ridiculous he said 
The senator said Congress had moved to improve the militarys 
effectiveness but that calls for a state of emergency were 
counterproductive here The Philippines has bitter memories of 
eight years of martial law imposed by President Ferdinand Marcos 
from 197281 
About 100 communist rebels attacked a militia post on Mindanao 
island killing a militiaman the military reported Tuesday 
It said rebels attacked the outpost at Pangatalan village before 
dawn Monday near Sindangan about 470 miles southeast of Manila in 
Zamboanga del Norte province 
Other rebels ambushed a detachment of soldiers sent to the 
village and a civilian was killed by a stray bullet the report 
said The rebels then fled
