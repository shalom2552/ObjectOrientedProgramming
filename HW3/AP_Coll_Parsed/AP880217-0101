Jesse Jackson said today he hopes to get 
support from Bruce Babbitt if Babbitt drops out of the Democratic 
presidential race as expected while Paul Simon set the stage for 
his withdrawal if he doesnt win somewhere next week 
Jackson who finished fourth said he and Babbitt discussed the 
former Arizona governors political future as voters were casting 
the ballots that left Babbitt in sixth place Tuesday night 
He wanted to discuss what his options were which he is still 
wrestling with with his wife Hattie Jackson said on CBS This 
Morning Hes not made a final judgment 
Jackson quickly added I hope I get his support 
Simon who finished third in the Democratic race behind Michael 
Dukakis and Richard Gephardt said the balloting next week would 
determine his political future 
I have to win either in South Dakota or Minnesota and we have 
to get additional campaign contributions he said on NBC Those 
two things have to be there otherwise Im going to have to 
withdraw You have to win somewhere 
After Iowas caucuses last week Alexander M Haig Jr withdrew 
from the Republican presidential race 
Babbitt who also appeared on the CBS program indicated today 
that he would like to continue his campaign saying Ive devoted 
a year to talking to the American people 
His wife who joined him in the interview added I think 
well keep going with the message of this campaign 
Babbitt said Tuesday it was premature for Jackson and former 
Colorado Sen Gary Hart to be wooing his backers saying he would 
spend a few days in Washington and call and talk to my supporters 
all over the country and ask them this question How can we 
keep this reform movement alive 
He had said prior to the New Hampshire primary that the states 
voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy 
Republican Rep Jack Kemp of New York got 13 percent of the GOP 
vote and voiced optimism today over his thirdplace showing behind 
Vice President George Bush and Dole 
Were going to do well in Minnesota Kemp said on the ABC 
program 
The New York congressman added that people recognize we are 
viable we are confident that we will be able to raise money 
Pete du Pont who got 10 percent of the GOP vote found cause to 
cheer in that fourthplace showing just ahead of Pat Robertson in 
the fiveman Republican race 
Point is weve all finished together du Pont said of the 
trio on the GOPs bottom rung And on his prospects in the days 
ahead We did much better in New Hampshire than we did in Iowa 
Well do much better in the South than we did in New Hampshire 
Robertson who finished with 9 percent said the South would be 
a welcome change after Iowa which was Doles neighborhood and New 
Hampshire which was claimed by Bush Tomorrow morning I go into 
the South and theyre going to be playing in my backyard 
For the Democrats though neither Jackson nor Gore got a New 
England boost to take South both were sure to find friendlier 
territory in Dixie 
Weve already been saving our resources for Super Tuesday 
said Gore in an interview from Houston on CBS Ive spent more 
time here than other candidates 
Both Hart and Jackson who happened upon Babbitt at Cable News 
Networks studio in Manchester as the votes rolled in Tuesday 
night huddled with the former Arizona governor to ask his support 
should he withdraw 
Our message has tremendous overlap I hope that in time we 
will work out some common ground in terms of our politics said 
Jackson who finished with 8 percent ahead of Gores 7 percent 
Babbitts 5 percent and Harts 4 percent 
Hart said he expects to be a candidate as far ahead in the 
future as I can see But he added I understand that there are 
standards that have to be met in terms of delegates and votes he 
said It will take at least 30 to 60 days to determine if I can 
put together a viable candidacy
