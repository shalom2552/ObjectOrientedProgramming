AshtonTate Corp and Compaq Computer Corp have 
scheduled announcements for Wednesday that mark the personal 
computer industrys steady transition to a more powerful internal 
traffic cop 
AshtonTate Corp is to unveil a vastly improved version o its 
DBase software the dominant program for managing information 
stored in personal computers 
DBase IV is capable of running under the new traffic cop 
Operating System2 the stateoftheart software for directing 
traffic inside a personal computer 
Separately Compaq is to announce Wednesday it is beginning 
deliveries of Operating System2 for use in Compaq personal 
computers 
The announcements mark the growing acceptance of Operating 
System2 since its announcement last April by Microsoft Corp The 
software allows computers to run several jobs at the same time and 
to handle bigger programs than can be handled by its predecessor 
MSDOS 
OS2 will supersede MSDOS as the operating system of choice by 
the end of 1990 with 37 million copies shipped that year vs 15 
million copies of MSDOS Forrester Research Inc of Cambridge 
Mass predicted recently 
AshtonTates DBase IV should help the Torrance Califbased 
company against challengers such as Borland International Inc 
Microrim Inc and Oracle Corp according to analysts who got 
previews of the product 
This product is a major advance over DBase III Plus in almost 
every dimension Edward M Esber Jr chairman and chief 
executive said in an interview Tuesday 
AshtonTate had more than 60 percent of sales of database 
managers for personal computers last year the company says 
Houstonbased Compaq is highlighting the ability of its 
computers to run Operating System2 as part of a publicrelations 
battle with International Business Machines Corp which says its 
new Personal System2 computers are best suited to run OS2 
Compaq is to have 21 independent software developers including 
AshtonTate at an industry forum commenting on their plans for 
programs that will take advantage of OS2s features 
Compaq intends to demonstrate that Operating System2 runs 
faster on Compaq computers than on IBM computers although IBM was 
involved in OS2s development Michael Swavely Compaqs vice 
president of marketing said in an interview Tuesday 
The new version of AshtonTates DBase features a redesigned 
look known as what you see is what you get and spares computer 
novices from having to do any programming to enter or retrieve 
information from the computer 
For advanced users a new programming language includes 245 new 
or improved commands and incorporates the industrystandard 
Structured Query Language created by International Business 
Machines Corp 
In addition to running under the new Operating System2 DBase 
IV can also run under Microsofts older MSDOS which is still the 
one used on most personal computers 
DBase IV includes a compiler that allows it to run 10 times as 
fast as DBase III Plus AshtonTate said The compiler reduces the 
instructions in a program to a machine language that a computer can 
read rapidly 
Esber said the new version contains about 400000 lines of 
programming code vs 106000 in DBase III Plus 
The price is 795 up from 695 for DBase III Plus Current 
DBase users can buy upgrades to DBase IV for 175 
Esber said the program was being announced early because the 
company will be showing it in a national tour led by IBM that 
begins next week 
Some of AshtonTates competitors have stumbled in efforts to 
beat the company to the market with database managers that work 
with Operating System2 
Borland and Oracle have failed to meet their own deadlines for 
database managers that run under Operating System2 However they 
may still beat AshtonTate to market because Esber said DBase IV 
might not be available until the end of July
