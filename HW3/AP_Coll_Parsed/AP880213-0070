Secretary of State George Shultz said he 
once feared terrorism would paralyze the United States but now 
believes the nation has firm convictions about how to deal with the 
problem 
Above all the American people understand more clearly the 
risks especially the risks of dealing with hostage situations 
Shultz said in remarks Friday to the executive committee of the 
AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith 
The secretary who will travel this month to the Soviet Union 
and Middle East spoke after receiving the Jewish groups Joseph 
Prize for Human Rights 
Shultz made no reference to the IranContra affair in which 
critics said the administration went against its own policy by 
pursuing an exchange of arms for hostages 
He said the Reagan administrations policy toward terrorism is 
firm and working 
We will not make concessions to terrorists or compromise our 
fundamental principles Schultz said Behavior rewarded is 
behavior repeated Terrorism must not pay 
Shultz said he feared several years ago that moral confusion 
and our instinct for finding fault with ourselves would paralyze us 
in the face of terrorism Since then much has happened But I 
believe that we have all emerged from our experiences with a firm 
set of convictions about terrorism 
The 30minute speech was interrupted by applause seven times 
including when Shultz said Israel has provided a great example in 
dealing with terrorism 
Courage skill and public support are the watchwords of the 
Israeli effort against terrorism Shultz said When the story 
is written of how the democracies beat the terrorists let our 
names appear together 
Shultz divided administration policy on combating terrorism into 
four categories intelligencegathering understanding terrorists 
aims and strategies security measures to protect Americans and 
offensive efforts to disrupt terrorist operations 
He said intelligence efforts have averted more than 200 
terrorist attacks in the past three years and people are alive 
and well today who never even suspected they were in danger
