Ceasefire talks between the Nicaraguan 
government and the Contra rebels will not succeed until the 
Sandinistas make more democratic reforms at home a Contra delegate 
to the negotiations said 
Fernando Aguero and six other Contra delegates arrived in 
Guatemala City for talks today aimed at achieving a ceasefire in 
the sixyear war between the rebels and Nicaraguas leftist 
Sandinista government 
In another developmentthe foreign ministers of five Central 
American countries met Wednesday in San Salvador capital of El 
Salvador to discuss a way to verify compliance with a regional 
peace plan 
The ministers from Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala Costa 
Rica and Honduras did not come up with a verification plan but 
agreed to meet again by March 15 in Guatemala City 
Regarding the truce negotiations the Contra delegates said in 
Guatemala City on Wednesday they still want to expand the talks to 
include representatives of the internal Nicaraguan opposition and 
to cover political issues 
Our position has not changed and it will not change Aguero 
said There can be no ceasefire unless the Sandinistas first 
agree to democratic reforms in Nicaragua 
Nicaraguas government has insisted on limiting the discussions 
with the USsupported Contras to the mechanics of working out a 
30day truce that could lead to a permanent ceasefire 
The Sandinistas say they will talk about political changes in 
Nicaragua only after the Contras have accepted an amnesty laid 
down their arms and resumed civilian life within the country 
Victor Hugo Tinoco the Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister is 
heading the Sandinista delegation to the peace talks scheduled to 
end Saturday 
Jaime Morales Carazo a former Managua banker leads the Contra 
group Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo Roman Catholic archbishop of 
Nicaragua is mediator 
The first direct talks between the warring sides were last month 
in San Jose Costa Rica a week before the US House of 
Representatives voted down President Reagans request for 362 
million in Contra aid 
Negotiators for the rebels and the Sandinistas offered sharply 
contrasting proposals at the twoday session in January which was 
noted both for its cordiality and lack of progress Diplomatic 
observers suggested neither side wanted to rock the boat before the 
congressional vote 
At that session the Sandinistas offered a slightly revised 
version of a negotiating position first outlined by President 
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua on a visit to Washington last Nov 13 
It called for a truce from March 15 to April 15 
The Sandinistas said at the time that the army would halt 
offensive operations on March 1 to give the Contras time to move 
into three ceasefire zones in the northern central and southern 
parts of Nicaragua 
Once inside the zones the Contras would be permitted to retain 
their weapons and receive food medicine clothing and other 
humanitarian supplies from the International Red Cross or any other 
recognized international relief agency 
At the end of the truce period the Contras would be expected to 
hand over their arms to an international commission accept amnesty 
and return to civilian life with full constitutional guarantees 
The Contras have asked the government to agree to 17 changes in 
Nicaraguas constitution including a prohibition on presidential 
succession electoral reforms limits on presidential power and 
separation of the army from the governing Sandinista party 
The talks are being held in accordance with a Central American 
peace plan signed last August by the five countries whose foreign 
ministers met in San Salvador 
At the meeting Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto of Costa 
Rica told reporters the officials must discuss certain issues in 
more detail and at greater length 
In a joint statement the ministers said they would seek help in 
verifying compliance with the regional peace plan from other 
countries and organizations of recognized impartiality and 
technical capability that have shown their desire to cooperate with 
the Central American peace process 
The foreign ministers form the peace plans verification panel 
The presidents of the Central American countries decided last month 
to dissolve an earlier more extensive commission in favor of the 
panel of foreign ministers 
The peace plan calls for ceasefire talks between the 
governments and rebels in El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua as a 
first step toward democratic elections It also urges political 
amnesties and a ban on all outside military assistance to rebel 
groups
