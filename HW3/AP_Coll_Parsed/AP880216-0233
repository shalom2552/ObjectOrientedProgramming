California First Bank which is controlled 
by the Bank of Tokyo Ltd said Tuesday that it has agreed to 
acquire Union Bank in a deal valued at around 750 million 
The transaction represents the largest investment ever by a 
Japanese bank in a California financial institution said Dan 
Williams an analyst for Sutro amp Co Inc in San Francisco 
Theyre getting close to being a major California bank he 
said 
The deal will more than double the size of Cal First to a total 
of 152 billion in assets with 167 California offices making it 
the states fifth largest commercial bank Los Angelesbased Union 
currently is fifth trailing Bank of America Security Pacific 
Wells Fargo and First Interstate 
Seishichi Itoh president and chief executive officer of Cal 
First said the bank had signed a letter of intent to acquire Union 
from Londonbased Standard Chartered PLC 
Bank of Tokyo owns 77 percent of California First known until 
several years ago as Bank of Tokyo of California 
California First spokesman Mike Colwell said the merger makes 
a good match because Union is a major business bank and Cal 
First mainly serves individual consumers 
However Standard amp Poors Corp was critical of the deal and 
placed its credit ratings of all Cal First Bank of Tokyo and Union 
Bancorp of California on its CreditWatch list SampP noted Union 
Banks narrowing margins and high overhead expenses and said 
these concerns are exacerbated by Bank of Tokyos relatively 
large exposure to sovereign borrowers with payment difficulties 
The merger is part of a growing interest among the Japanese in 
US financial firms 
Last year Nippon Life Insurance Co invested 500 million in 
Shearson Lehman Bros Inc and Sumitomo Bank Ltd completed a 
similarly sized investment in Goldman Sachs amp Co Also last year a 
group of Japanese banks and insurance companies purchased 350 
million in BankAmerica Corp securities
