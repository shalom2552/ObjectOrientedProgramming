Iraq said today its gunners downed two 
Iranian drone planes in the southern sector of the war front 
confirming for the first time that Tehran is using pilotless 
reconnaissance aircraft 
The official Iraqi News Agency monitored in Nicosia said both 
drones were downed Sunday night It quoted an unnamed military 
spokesman as saying the first plane crashed in Iranian territory 
and the second in Iraq 
On Sunday Iran reported that it fired on US helicopters 
flying ahead of a convoy of reflagged Kuwaiti ships escorted 
through the Persian Gulf by American vessels The Pentagon said it 
had no evidence of the confrontation 
Iran recently reported that homebuilt drones have been 
successfully tested and that its war factories now were working on 
drone fighter planes It was not clear from the Iraqi report if the 
drones reportedly downed had been manufactured in Iran 
Iranian officials had boasted that the drones would boost the 
countrys air force Irans USsupplied air force is outnumbered 
by the Iraqis by eight to one 
Iran has had difficulty finding spare parts for its warplanes 
because of sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic after 
militants stormed the American embassy in Tehran in November 1979 
and held 53 American hostages for 444 days 
Western military analysts say Iran has 60 to 70 working 
warplanes 
In recent weeks Iranian warplanes have been action in the war 
with Iraq suggesting Tehran may have bought some of its air force 
needs on the black market 
Iranian officials also say Iran now makes its own version of the 
Chinesemade longrange surfacetosurface missiles and other 
projectiles as part of a drive toward selfsufficiency 
Iran stepped up efforts to manufacture its own weapons after the 
United States proposed an international arms embargo of Iran to 
force its rulers to agree to a UN Security Council call for a 
ceasefire in the 7yearold gulf war 
Iran claimed this weekend that its forces opened direct fire 
on US Navy helicopters that were carrying out reconnaissance 
operations Friday ahead of a convoy of USflagged Kuwaiti ships 
in the gulf forcing the American helicopters to flee 
But a Pentagon spokesman in Washington denied the report 
We have no reports that indicated that event occurred 
said US Air Force Maj Randall Morder
