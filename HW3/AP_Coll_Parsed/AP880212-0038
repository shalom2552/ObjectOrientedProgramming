Here is the text of Alexander M Haig 
Jrs statement Friday announcing his withdrawal from the 
Republican presidential race 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
Its evident to me that the contest in Hawaii Michigan and 
Iowa and my own assessment of New Hampshire make it clear that Al 
Haig will not be the Republican candidate in 1988 
My choice therefore is to work as effectively as I can for the 
principles and the policies that led me into the race in the first 
place Im therefore announcing today my withdrawal as a candidate 
for the Republican presidential nomination and my support for the 
candidate best qualified to lead this nation 
To my family my friends and my supporters let me express my 
enduring gratitude for the devotion and your help throughout this 
campaign Only in America could a nonpolitician have achieved even 
as much as I have Even though I was the darkest of the dark 
horses you supported me because you and I believe at the very 
least we could shape the issues in this campaign Believe me 
weve done that 
To my fellow Republicans and to my fellow Americans let me say 
this The 88 elections should not be about business as usual in 
America Our next president should not be a man who offers simply 
more of the same We need a leader who truly reflects the 
mainstream values that made this country great including hard 
work moral convictions and tolerance for the diversity of 
America We should have the experience and the skill that comes 
from a record of having made a difference And our next president 
should understand that good government means competent government 
run by the very best people America can provide 
In my judgment Senator Robert Dole is the candidate best able 
to lead our country into the 90s He has risen from among the 
people through hard work and honest effort He has never forgotten 
that America is above all the adventure of the common man And he 
knows from experience how to make our government work Bob Dole has 
indeed made a difference 
As a candidate in this campaign only Bob Dole embodies best my 
understanding of the crucial challenges we face and what we must do 
to meet them He knows and I agree that we must tackle the 
horrendous budget deficit now without resorting to shortterm 
gimmicks or destructive tax increases that would cripple our 
nations economy He knows and I agree that the answer to our 
trade policy must not be selfdefeating protectionism 
He knows and I agree that in dealing with the Soviet Union we 
must give Moscow no choice but restraint And above all it is 
very clear to me that Bob Dole has the strength of character a 
president must have to deal with Mikhail Gorbachev 
I am proud to offer my support for Bob Dole I urge each of my 
supporters and all Republicans to vote for Bob Dole in this crucial 
New Hampshire primary and every primary thereafter The party needs 
Bob Dole so does America 
Now finally a word about that unique American institution the 
media Every candidate for a high public office undergoes the most 
searching scrutiny from the media They were fair to me I hope you 
feel I was fair to you
