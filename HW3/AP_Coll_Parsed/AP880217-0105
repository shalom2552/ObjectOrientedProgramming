Narcotics agents mistakenly raided a 
ministers house after counting from the wrong end of the block 
officials said 
I thought they were robbers said Hector Sanchez whose 
daughter Noemi woke him up early Sunday to say three men were in 
the backyard with crowbars and guns 
Sanchez a minister at the Spanish Assembly of God Church says 
he asked the men what they wanted and they told him to stop or be 
shot They then followed him into the house Sanchez said 
When he one of the officers told me he was from the state 
police I was relieved Sanchez said But I was still 
frightened 
His wife and two daughters sat in the living room while the men 
went through the house and out front where they ran into the rest 
of the raiding party and learned of their mistake 
Sgt Don Bush blames of the Department of Public Safety 
narcotics division blames human error 
The department had assigned men to two groups Bush said One 
group was supposed to enter the targeted home from the front and 
the other the group that raided the Sanchez home was supposed 
to guard the rear 
Because the houses dont have numbers on the back the group in 
the rear was instructed to count houses from the corner Bush said 
The problem he said was that they started counting at the wrong 
end of the block 
Later Sunday public safety officers and the Abilene Police 
Departments Special Services Bureau arrested seven people down the 
block
