Ann Pfoser Darby and Wayne Green are locked 
in the least publicized least competitive least important race in 
the New Hampshire presidential primary and if history is a 
teacher neither one will win 
Darby and Green are running on the Republican ticket for vice 
president David Duke is unopposed on the Democratic side but 
thats no assurance of victory 
In the past the winner usually has been a writein candidate 
with a bit more name recognition George Bush in 1984 Spiro Agnew 
in 1972 Richard Nixon in 1956 and 1964 Robert Kennedy in 1964 
Hubert Humphrey in 1968 
And the winner gets nothing but a little publicity 
Unlike the presidential race that influences delegates at the 
national party conventions the vice presidential race influences 
no one 
The vice presidential candidates for the Republican and 
Democratic parties will be chosen as usual at the conventions by 
the presidential nominees However some vice presidential 
primaries have had a more lasting effect on the Republican and 
Democratic tickets 
In 1956 President Dwight Eisenhower was considering whether to 
keep Nixon on the ticket and he used the primary as a sounding 
board Nixon attracted 23000 writein votes 20000 more than the 
runnerup and stayed on the ticket 
In 1972 there was some discontent with Spiro Agnew as Nixons 
running mate but that was put to rest when Agnew drew 45524 
writein votes the most ever 
Darby a high school teacher in New York City paid the 1000 
filing fee to try to change all that She wants the vice 
presidential candidates independently elected by the people 
Its something that always bugged me Darby said in a 
telephone interview The idea came to me that I can bring the 
issue to the people through the primaries If I get a mandate in 
New Hampshire Ill take it to other states If I dont get the 
votes it means they didnt like the idea 
Darby 53 a former GOP district leader in New York and former 
school board chairwoman campaigns in New Hampshire on weekends and 
expects to spend more than 5000 to get her point across 
Green 65 is making his second run at the vice presidency A 
magazine publisher from Hancock NH he freely acknowledges Me 
being vice president would be a disaster 
He ran in 1964 when he learned that no one had ever filed for 
the job since the New Hampshire primary first included candidates 
in 1952 Writeins for vice president got all the votes from 1952 
to 1960 
Greens total campaign cost was 16 for bumper stickers he 
said But he did get media coverage and attracted 8030 votes 
122 fewer than writeins for Nixon and 1600 more than writeins 
for Henry Cabot Lodge 
This time I have a message he said Mainly he wants to 
improve education raise productivity and cut military costs 
Duke 37 is a former Ku Klux Klan leader and founder of the 
National Association for the Advancement of White People in 
Metairie La Duke who says he is an author also filed for the 
presidency 
His coordinator Ralph Forbes said the vice presidential filing 
was a lastminute decision and a mistake because Duke thought he 
could win binding delegates 
Duke wants to be president and wants to have 2000 
delegates when the Democratic convention begins Forbes said 
Forbes said Duke believes the white middle class is no longer 
represented properly especially in the areas of housing and jobs 
The three hope for enough publicity and votes to promote their 
ideas 
And in the words of Richard Upton the man who introduced the 
legislation establishing a New Hampshire candidates primary in 
1952 Maybe lightning would strike
