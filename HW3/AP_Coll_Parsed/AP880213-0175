A couple locked in a legal tugofwar 
over Baby M will meet with Mary Beth WhiteheadGould in an attempt 
to reach a settlement on visitation for the surrogate mother a 
newspaper reported Saturday 
William and Elizabeth Stern agreed to a private meeting after 
much soulsearching said their attorney Gary N Skoloff The 
StarLedger of Newark reported 
When the state Supreme Court ruled on the case earlier this 
month it directed a Superior Court judge to set visitation 
guidelines for Mrs WhiteheadGould and the nearly 2yearold child 
The states highest court overturned a lower court decision that 
upheld a 10000 contract under which Mrs WhiteheadGould was 
artificially inseminated with Sterns sperm and bore the child for 
him and his wife 
In addition to stripping her of her parental rights the lower 
court last March 31 awarded custody of the baby to the Sterns 
The Supreme Court maintained custody for the Sterns but voided 
the contract and and the termination of Mrs WhiteheadGoulds 
parental rights and ruled she was entitled a hearing on visiting 
her child She now gets to visit the child two hours a week under 
a temporary visitation order 
As of late last week a court date for a visitation hearing 
before Superior Court Judge Birger M Sween had not been set 
Harold Cassidy attorney for Mrs WhiteheadGould did not say 
what visitation she would seek during the meeting with the Sterns 
or when the meeting would take place the newspaper said 
The proposed meeting marks the first time the Sterns have 
pursued an outofcourt settlement in the dispute over Baby M 
named Melissa by the Sterns 
The Sterns have decided after much soulsearching and 
additional professional advice that it is in the best interest of 
Melissa Stern to seek a meeting with the surrogate and her 
husband Dean Gould Skoloff said 
Cassidy did not return a phone call to his home on Saturday 
There was no answer at Skoloffs office
