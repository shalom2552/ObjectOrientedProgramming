Midnight voters in the New Hampshire 
mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch gave Republican George Bush and 
Democrat Richard Gephardt the winning votes in the nations 1988 
leadoff presidential primary 
More often than not Dixvilles votes have been a bellwether for 
candidates seeking the presidential nomination 
Bush received 11 votes Gephardt 4 In the rest of the 
Republican field Bob Dole had 6 Jack Kemp 5 Pete du Pont 2 
Alexander Haig 2 Pat Robertson 1 
Among Democrats Paul Simon received 3 No other Democrats 
received votes 
In the primary Dixville has a pretty good record in choosing 
the eventual candidates for each party Town Clerk Tom Tillotson 
said of past elections Its just when we came to November wed 
frequently be in the wrong party 
Since 1960 Dixville Notch voters have sided with the loser in 
all but three presidential elections They picked the winners in 
1972 when they favored Richard Nixon over George McGovern and in 
1980 and 1984 when they sided with Ronald Reagan 
Few residents of the resort town in northern New Hampshire were 
willing to discuss in advance how they might cast their ballots 
Because so many people are asking the voters tend to not be 
committal even amongst themselves said Tillotson a supporter 
of Vice President George Bush 
Tillotsons father Neil came up with the idea in 1960 of 
making Dixville Notch the first town in the first primary state to 
cast ballots 
Now 89 and the town moderator the elder Tillotson who owns 
The Balsams resort hotel where the votes are cast and a surgical 
glove factory that is the towns only industry incorporated 
Dixville Notch that year to push the village into the national 
spotlight 
Every four years most of the candidates or their surrogates 
make their way five hours north of Boston to Dixville Notch 
population 47 to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles south 
of the Quebec border They are followed by more reporters 
photographers and TV camera crews than there are residents in town 
Residents take seriously their place in political history They 
make sure to be in their voting booths by 1145 pm so they can 
drop their ballots into the ballot box at the stroke of midnight
