Physicians concerned for the unborn should not 
turn to the courts to force pregnant women to undergo Caesarean 
sections drug abuse treatment or other procedures two medical 
researchers argue 
Such use of the legal system is unethical and could open the 
door to court interference in such personal decisions as whether a 
pregnant woman continues to work the researchers said in an essay 
in Fridays Journal of the American Medical Association 
Judicial involvement inevitably invades a womans privacy 
entails the disclosure of confidential medical and personal 
information and thrusts the woman into the adversarial system 
wrote Dr Nancy Milliken of the University of California at San 
Francisco and Lawrence J Nelson of the University of California at 
Berkeley 
Once in that system the woman must defend her choices on a 
highly personal matter at a time when she is psychologically and 
physically illdisposed to do so they said 
George J Annas a professor of health law at Boston University 
School of Medicine said in a telephone interview Wednesday that 
the mainstream now is to agree with the essay though some 
specialists in infant care still favor court intervention 
However Milliken said she and Nelson wrote the essay out of 
concern over a survey last year indicating a significant number of 
gynecology department heads believed court intervention was 
acceptable to force pregnant women to accept treatment on behalf of 
fetuses 
More harm than good results from making adversaries out of 
mother and fetus said the essay which supports a stand adopted in 
August by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
Over the longterm not only would court interventions undermine 
the doctorpatient relationship but they would necessitate an 
impossible task defining reliable standards for stepping in the 
essay said 
Forcing women to undergo medical treatment against their wills 
is too weighty a matter to be left to the vagaries of personal 
interpretation by physicians and judges said the essay 
The issue comes up most often in courtordered Caesarean 
sections and forced transfusions to the fetus Milliken said in a 
telephone interview Wednesday 
The extension would be to seek out women for other 
behaviors she said That could be anything from smoking to 
continuing to work sexual activity if contraindicated or of 
not following a recommended medical regimen 
Milliken and Nelson said We recognize that the behavior of 
women who are abusers of alcohol or drugs poses significant 
potential for fetal harm 
However there are solid reasons to doubt that a system of 
legal punishment or intervention would decrease the incidence of 
this behavior as it is usually an addiction over which these women 
have little control
