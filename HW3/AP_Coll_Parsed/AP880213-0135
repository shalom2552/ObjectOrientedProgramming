The weekend takeover of a University of 
Massachusetts building by black students protesting campus racism 
is the latest in a series of incidents at the school in recent 
years 
Minority students say school administrators have contributed to 
the problem by being insensitive to their concerns and by moving 
slowly in implementing recommendations made in a stinging 1987 
report that said the school has acted superficially and 
sporadically to deal with racism 
The mostpublicized incident on campus was a fight between white 
and black students following the New York Mets victory over the 
Boston Red Sox in the final game of the 1986 World Series 
In 1984 a black UMass senior who was arrested and jailed for 
two days before being cleared of setting a string of campus fires 
complained that her arrest was motivated by impermissible racial 
considerations 
Last year the university disciplined six white students who 
admitted chasing and beating a black student after the World Series 
game They pleaded no contest to assault charges 
It was the report ordered after that incident that lambasted 
UMass for not intervening to stem an apparent surge in racial 
tensions 
The administrations historical denial of racial problems 
caused not only the failure to predict and prevent the incident 
but also caused black student faculty and staff discontent with 
its conduct of the subsequent investigation a discontent which was 
exacerbated by a perception that the quality of campus life for 
minorities at UMass is generally declining the report said 
It called for the hiring more minority faculty and 
administrators and urged antiracism education for administrators 
Blacks constitute 7 percent of the schools 18000 undergraduates 
and only 38 of 1464 UMass professors are black 
UMass officials vowed when the report was released five months 
ago to work harder to improve race relations on campus But 
students interviewed in the past week following two recent 
incidents say little has changed 
Racism comes from inside said Matt Bigg black affairs 
editor at a student newspaper I cant express how much it hurts 
when a person hates you for something you cant help being Its a 
dull pain that never goes away
