The United States will discuss the resumption 
of aid to Fiji and send an ambassador to the Pacific archipelago in 
an attempt to encourage the countrys return to democratic rule 
the State Department said Tuesday 
In view of recent developments in Fiji that have set that 
nation on a course leading to the restoration of constitutional 
government ambassadordesignate Leonard Rochwarger will be 
proceeding to Fiji in the near future to assume his duties in 
Suva said spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley 
The previous US ambassador ended his tour of duty in Fiji 
prior to the May 14 1987 coup which overturned the islands 
parliamentary democracy and brought to power Col Sitiveni Rabuka 
The ambassador was not immediately replaced partly as a sign of 
US displeasure with the military takeover 
The United States continues to deplore the circumstances that 
undermine democratic institutions in Fiji said Mrs Oakley At 
the same time the return of executive authority to civilian hands 
and the public commitment of the interim civilian government to 
a process aimed at restoring constitutional government is a 
positive step that we wish to encourage she added 
Fiji returned to civilian rule in December when Rabuka 
appointed former governorgeneral Sir Penaiai Ganilau as president 
and Ganilau returned Sir Kamisese Mara to his former post of prime 
minister Rabuka retains control of security matters 
Mrs Oakley said the State Department was also starting 
consultations with Congress on resuming the 13 million dollars in 
economic aid which was suspended following the May coup Congress 
is expected to unfreeze the funds
