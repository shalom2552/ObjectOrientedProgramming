Dennis Clouthier is a conservative 
Republican proStar Wars proContra aid and opposed to the 
USSoviet nuclear arms treaty Yet in 1986 he voted for a 
liberal Democrat for governor solely because the GOP incumbent 
championed the Seabrook nuclear power plant 
The stalled 52 billion project on New Hampshires seacoast 
has been a leading state and regional issue throughout much of its 
16year history Now its foes hope voters like Clouthier will make 
it an influential factor in the first presidential primary of the 
1988 season possibly ruining the presidential bid of Vice 
President George Bush 
All seven major Democratic presidential candidates are to some 
extent opposed to Seabrook with Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis 
playing a key role in blocking a license for the completed reactor 
But there are some sharp distinctions among the five Republican 
aspirants 
Seabrook opponents criticize pronuclear Republicans at the 
bottom of the polls former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont and former 
television evangelist Pat Robertson But their chief target is 
Bush whose frontrunner status in New Hampshire polls has been 
jeopardized by his thirdplace showing in the Iowa caucuses 
Bush views on Seabrook have echoed those of his state campaign 
chairman Gov John Sununu Its fate should be left to the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission not state governors 
George Bush is going to do terribly on the seacoast among 
Republicans because of Seabrook and it could end up costing him 
the presidency said Kurt Ehrenberg of Search 88 He noted that 
a littleknown antiSeabrook challenger to Sununu in the 1986 
gubernatorial primary won 22 percent of the vote statewide and up 
to 45 percent in some seacoast towns 
To try to help fulfill that prophecy Ehrenbergs group last 
week began airing radio ad on seacoast stations that concluded 
If you dont want Seabrook you dont want George Bush 
Bush campaign aide Andrew Card disputed Ehrenbergs prediction 
I dont think voters are that parochial Card said It 
will be an issue but one of many many issues in the primary not 
a cutting issue 
Electing a governor and electing a president are two different 
things said Paul Young of New York Rep Jack Kemps campaign 
But he also speculated that Seabrook could have an impact if it 
costs Bush support on the seacoast 
Kemp a strong proponent of states rights has asked federal 
regulators to hold up a lowpower license for Seabrook before 
evacuation plans are developed that win the confidence of people 
within the plants 10mile emergency planning zone 
I want to make clear he is not against nuclear power just 
for the health and safety of the people Young said 
However the Kemp camp has not been trumpeting its positions on 
Seabrook 
I understand that Thats politics said Mimi Fallon of the 
group Republicans Against Seabrook Station Theyre afraid 
theyre going to lose the people they already have on the other 
side who support the plant said Fallon who supports Kemp 
Another Republican hopeful Sen Bob Dole of Kansas has 
suggested that the nonpartisan National Academy of Sciences review 
Seabrooks evacuation plans because of a perception that the NRC 
favors the industry it is supposed to regulate In December Dole 
also asked the NRC to hold up lowpower testing until evacuation 
issues are settled 
Id like to see Senator Dole go a little further but Im not 
knocking what hes done Ehrenberg said Hes a tough guy to 
move on some issues thats clear Hes a very careful politician 
What irks the antiSeabrook activists is Doles insistence that 
governors should not have veto power over nuclear plants But in an 
interview this month Dole also said a governor has got to be 
certain that the rights of his people are protected 
On the Democratic side Dukakis is fighting in federal court 
against an NRC rule change that would allow approval of evacuation 
plans developed by utilities when governments balk Dukakis tried 
to reinforce his standing with antiSeabrook voters last week by 
holding a news conference with the reactor in the background 
Ehrenberg speculated that Dukakis action against Seabrook may 
have gained him some early organizational support in neighboring 
New Hampshire but that hasnt stopped the other Democrats from 
wooing the antiSeabrook vote in some cases in spite of 
generally pronuclear records 
Former Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt said he served on the 
presidential commission that investigated the 1979 Three Mile 
Island accident and recommended the evacuationplanning rules that 
have become Seabrooks major obstacle 
Former Colorado Sen Gary Hart said he sat on a congressional 
panel that helped write those recommendations law 
Jesse Jackson favors a rapid phaseout of all the nations 
nuclear power plants and notes that he opposed Seabrook in his 1984 
preidential campaign before the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet 
Union 
Sen Paul Simon of Illinois calls Seabrook a white elephant 
that should not operate and he held a news conference last week in 
the same place Dukakis did to criticize pronuclear votes by Rep 
Richard Gephardt of Missouri 
Simon noted that a nuclear industry lobbying group said last 
year that Gephardt voted with the industry 53 percent of the time 
in recent years But Gephardt says his votes came under a more 
vigilant NRC and he has learned since Chernobyl 
Sen Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee voted with the nuclear 
industry 55 percent of the time when he was in the House but has 
taken a lowkey position on problems at the Tennessee Valley 
Authority nuclear reactors 
Clouthier the New Hampshire voter who is a qualitycontrol 
manager said he doesnt see Seabrook as an overriding issue in the 
primary 
But I think theyre all avoiding it like a hot potato because 
it is so controversial Clouthier said
