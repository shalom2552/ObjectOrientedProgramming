Girls should be encouraged to exercise vigorously 
enough to delay their puberty because this may help protect them 
from breast cancer and other diseases later in life a researcher 
says 
Grade school girls who play strenuous sports often have their 
first menstrual period or menarche later than usual Even after 
adolescence starts they may miss periods if they work out 
regularly 
Although delayed or missing menstruation is often thought to be 
abnormal some experts now say that it is natural and even 
desirable because it may protect the body from the damaging 
effects of sex hormones 
American girls have been going through puberty at increasingly 
early ages throughout this century 
Dr Rose E Frisch of the Harvard School of Public Health said 
Sunday that typically American girls now have their first period at 
age 12 But if they exercise in such vigorous sports as tennis 
running basketball or soccer their average age at menarche is 
15 the same as it was 100 years ago 
And Frisch said a simple rule seems to apply The more menstrual 
cycles a woman has over her lifetime the greater her chance of 
breast cancer the biggest cancer killer among US women So 
anything that delays the start of menstruation should lower the 
cancer risk 
I suggest that regular exercise starting early in elementary 
school would have a longterm spinoff in reduced risk of breast 
cancer and from our data a reduced risk of diabetes and cancer of 
the reproductive system Frisch said 
She and other experts who study the effects of exercise on 
reproduction presented their work at a meeting of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science 
Recent federal statistics suggest that the risk of dying from 
breast cancer may actually be increasing 
Dr Jack Fishman of Rockefeller University said breast cancer 
may take 40 years to develop What you do in puberty can be very 
relevant to what happens in breast cancer after menopause he 
said 
Frisch based her recommendation in part on a study she 
conducted on 5398 women who graduated from 10 US colleges She 
found that those who had been athletic in college and high school 
had only about half as much cancer of the breast and reproductive 
system later in life as those didnt get regular exercise 
Those who have delayed or irregular periods during their 
teenage years seem to suffer no longterm problems Frischs study 
found that athletic women had just as many children as those who 
were less active 
Dr Tenley E Albright a Boston surgeon who was an Olympic 
skating champion said coaches and parents often consider delayed 
or missing periods to be a disorder while young athletes often do 
not 
She said the condition should be thought of as an appropriate 
adaptive response by the body not a defect 
The relationship between exercise and fertility is complex 
Experts believe that very lean and muscular women sometimes cannot 
get pregnant because their bodies do not have enough fat to nourish 
a growing fetus They must slow down their exercise and put on some 
weight to become fertile 
Studies have also found that lean women make more of a 
nonpotent kind of estrogen than do fatter women Estrogen is a key 
sex hormone that is essential for fertility but also plays a role 
in cancer of the breast and reproductive system 
Experts suggest that even though lean women may be fertile they 
produce less active estrogen And this may reduce the growth of 
cells in their breast and reproductive tissues When these cells 
proliferate less there is also less chance of a cell dividing 
abnormally and starting a tumor 
Some researchers also believe that among men extreme exercise 
can diminish the production of male sex hormones and might 
interfere with sperm production However the effects of exercise 
on male fertility appears to be much less dramatic in men than in 
women
