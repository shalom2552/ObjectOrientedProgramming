The New Hampshire primary was a great 
triumph for two disparate groups the Republican establishment and 
lovers of political chaos 
George Bush the quintessential establishment candidate emerged 
from the ashes of Iowa to regain the mantle of Republican 
frontrunner but his victory brightened the hopes of those who 
cherish rousing political brawls and hope for at least one this 
year that goes all the way to the convention floor 
Of course it is the Democrats with their looser rules and lack 
of a clear leader who really provide hope for an open convention 
Michael Dukakis triumph put him temporarily atop the Democratic 
field but none of the seven candidates has demonstrated national 
appeal 
And so its On to the South The candidates are all taking 
dead aim on the March 8 election day when most of the South and 
some key states outside will select enough delegates to settle the 
races in both parties 
But dont bet on a Super Tuesday resolution The big stakes 
1307 Democratic delegates in 20 states and 700 Republican in 16 
states may only confuse the contests rather than settle them 
You have to like Bushs chances but both parties offer 
scenarios that argue for long hard fights 
Two Democrats without obvious appeal in Dixie Rep Richard 
Gephardt of Missouri and Dukakis split the two early events and 
now are confronted by Sen Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee and Jesse 
Jackson on their own turf 
Jackson finished fourth in Iowa and New Hampshire solid 
showings in two states which have very few minority voters who 
provide his base of support There is no reason to think that any 
of the other Democrats can compete with Jackson for the large black 
vote in the South 
As a Tennessean who has positioned himself to the right of the 
rest of the Democratic field Gore has run a Super Tuesday strategy 
that will test a generationold political assumption that you 
cant win the nomination without competing in the early events 
I think Super Tuesday changes all the rules said Gore 
Its a completely new ball game 
Its a dicey strategy but even if it falls short Gore may get 
enough support on March 8 to establish his candidacy and perhaps 
leave Jackson as the biggest winner of delegates that day 
Then it would be on to the Midwest for four Democrats Jackson 
Dukakis Gephardt and Gore 
That prospect would delight Republicans But they could be in a 
muddle of their own 
If the Southern contest were Bush versus Sen Bob Dole the 
outcome would appear tilted in favor of the vice president who has 
a strong organization throughout the region a strong 
identification with President Reagan and roots in the biggest plum 
of all Texas 
But it wont be a twoman fight for the Republicans Rep Jack 
Kemp lives to fight on in the South and Pat Robertson will be 
battling on his home turf 
Bush and Dole are battling for the same voters while Robertson 
has a constituency all his own many of them people activated 
politically by a desire to support the former evangelist 
Republican rules make it almost impossible for the presidential 
race to go all the way to the convention in New Orleans next 
August Chances are better that two candidates or maybe even 
three will fight for the 175 delegates at stake in Californias 
winnertakeall Republican primary on June 7 But if there are 
three Republicans battling for that delegation the field may be so 
split that even a California win would not put someone over the top 
All in all its a volatile mix on both sides On the morning 
after New Hampshire a good bet is that Super Tuesday will settle 
nothing certainly among the Democrats and the cry that night 
will be On to California by way of Illinois New York
