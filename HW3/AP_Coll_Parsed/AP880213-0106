NATO members must work to reinvigorate the Western 
alliance because the arms control treaty with the Soviets does not 
mean the Kremlin has given up its ambitions of world dominance 
Senate Majority Leader Robert C Byrd said Saturday 
Byrd DWVa delivering his partys weekly radio address said 
the Intermediaterange Nuclear Forces treaty leaves nagging 
questions 
Where is the evidence that a halfcentury of Soviet pursuit of 
dominance and control has been bridled asked Byrd who is 
leading a bipartisan congressional delegation that is consulting 
with European leaders 
We are heartened to find that NATO leaders view the new Soviet 
leadership with a healthy dose of realism he said We know 
that our adversary has not abandoned its historic goals on the 
world scene 
Byrd said Western Europe and the United States are the only 
real foil to Soviet expansionism and should use the treaty as 
an invitation to fashion a stronger alliance among ourselves 
The key to peace is cohesion he said We must redeclare 
ourselves as an alliance The Soviets must be convinced of our 
public support the depth and flexibility of our armed response 
and our staying power 
We are still far from a time when the world is in perfect 
balance Byrd said Although nuclear deterrence is an essential 
component in the pursuit of peace NATO must soon offer a strong 
proposal on conventional and chemical weapons control
