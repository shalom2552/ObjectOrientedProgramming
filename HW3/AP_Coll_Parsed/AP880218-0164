Dozens of cars whizzed past a struggle 
between a mugger and a woman on the states busiest highway but no 
one stopped to help her police said 
Robin Keeley 37 a saleswoman from Germantown Md became 
stranded on the Schuylkill Expressway Tuesday night when she got a 
flat tire on her rental car 
After waiting 40 minutes inside the car for someone to stop to 
help her she was heartened to see a truck driver stop 
The man was driving a flatbed truck which he stopped about 300 
yards away she said As he walked toward her car she got out and 
started talking to him 
He seemed very friendly and helpful she said Wednesday 
He said he had helped somebody else with a flat tire further 
back 
But Ms Keeley said the man then knocked her to the ground and 
tried to drag her over a concrete barrier He finally fled with her 
purse when one motorist slowed and honked 
I was screaming and fighting but nobody stopped Ms Keeley 
said I had one hand out and I was trying to flag down cars I 
was just waving frantically with the one arm and fighting and 
kicking with the other 
Police estimated 40 to 50 vehicles passed by during the scuffle 
which occurred about 815 pm 
Tentoone a hundred people saw it State Trooper Stanley 
Wells said Youre talking about a very heavily traveled section 
of the highway 
Two anonymous callers reported the incident about 15 minutes 
afterward Wells said By time police arrived Ms Keeley had 
returned to her car and had driven it about a mile on the flat 
tire he said 
The man escaped with a black leather pocketbook containing about 
50 an airline ticket credit cards and an appointment book Wells
