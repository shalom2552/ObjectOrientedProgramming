Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis called 
Sunday for a 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons and a ban on 
nuclear warhead testing and weapons in space coupled with a 
strengthening of the nations conventional forces 
If the next president is required to use force it will almost 
certainly be conventional forces and not nuclear he said 
The Democratic presidential hopeful in what was billed as a 
major foreign policy speech said the next president isnt going 
to be giving blank checks to the Pentagon or to anybody else If he 
did the checks would bounce 
But we can have the forces we need at a price we can afford if 
we are willing to make some tough choices and if we invest our 
limited resources wisely he said 
Dukakis said he would seek to get a dollars worth of security 
for every dollar we spend 
In the speech the Massachusetts governor said he would not 
hesitate to use military force to defend vital interests 
There is no room in this hemisphere for military bases from 
which the Soviet Union or any other power for that matter might 
project military force against ourselves our allies or our 
friends Dukakis said And if Nicaragua or any other government 
in Central or South America seeks to overthrow or subvert its 
neighbors we have the right and the responsibility to stop them 
But Dukakis repeated his opposition to aid to Contra rebels 
fighting the Nicaraguan Sandinista government And he pledged to 
abide by the War Powers Act which places limits on presidential 
use of military force 
He also said he would observe the treaty of the Organization of 
American States and the rulings of the World Court President 
Reagan has violated all three Dukakis said 
Dukakis accused the Reagan administration of bumbling and 
incompetence in addition to violation of international law 
Theres nothing strong about wandering around the Persian Gulf 
without a minesweeper Dukakis said a reference to the Navys 
failure to send a minesweeping vessel to that region when Reagan 
first ordered escorts of oil tankers 
Theres nothing strong about selling arms to terrorists 
Dukakis said He said that as president he would never make 
concessions to terrorists although he said he would talk to them 
if the situation warranted 
And Dukakis said that in his administration Authority in the 
executive branch will come not from an admiral or a lieutenant 
colonel but from the commander in chief 
Dukakis avoided comment on a new commercial by rival Paul Simon 
which cites a recent editorial in the Lawrence Mass 
EagleTribune The editorial says if elected the governor would 
lead a bureaucracy not the people 
Questioned outside the Derry NH Knights of Columbus Hall
