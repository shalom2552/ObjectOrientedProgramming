Former Black Panther Johnny Spain one of the 
San Quentin Six involved in a 1971 prison shootout must remain in 
prison pending a hearing on his request for parole in an unrelated 
murder a judge ruled 
Spain 38 had already served five years of a life sentence for 
murderrobbery at the time of the escape attempt at the San Quentin 
state prison in which three guards and three prisoners were killed 
At Wednesdays hearing in Superior Court Spains attorney 
Dennis Riordan argued that parole authorities have refused to 
apply normal standards for release to Spains original 
murderrobbery sentence to punish him for his role in the 1971 
shootout 
The attorney argued that authorites have unfairly taken the San 
Quentin shootout into account when considering parole against the 
orders of the judge who reversed the conviction and despite a 
prison record he described as exemplary 
Riordan was seeking Spains release on bail pending a ruling on 
his request that the convict be paroled for a 1966 murderrobbery 
in Los Angeles 
Superior Judge Kathleen Parker denied bail telling Riordan she 
didnt have authority to grant it But she scheduled a full hearing 
March 1 on the parole request 
Spain was convicted of two counts of murder in the prison 
shootout but the conviction was overturned 
On Feb 11 a threemember panel of the state Board of Prison 
Terms voted to free Spain after he serves an additional 16 months 
of the original murderrobbery sentence bringing the total time 
served on his life term to 23 years 
At Wednesdays hearing Riordan maintained the average sentence 
in such cases is 10 years and the longest a Californian other than 
Spain has been imprisoned on a similar conviction is 20 years
