About 2500 tugboat workers and other marine 
employees went on strike today against nine marine transport 
companies after efforts to reach a new contract failed 
Pickets said they hoped to shut down New York Harbor Were 
going to try said Gordon MacDonald who was on a picket line 
this morning Its our livelihood 
About 200 pickets went up about 1201 am said police Officer 
Susan Henry adding Its been real quiet 
Police said Monday they were moving to head off possible 
confrontations between strikers and replacement workers Lt Donald 
Boyle said 100 officers would be assigned to watch towing companies 
on Staten Island 
Albert Cornette president of Local 333 of the International 
Longshoremens Association said his 2500 members on Monday 
unanimously rejected companies demands to eliminate 750 jobs and 
for wage and benefit concessions from 40 percent to 62 percent 
We offered them a contract to keep them competitive 
Cornette said but all they want to do is break us 
He said he proposed the current contract with no improvements 
for the next three years But they want to eliminate our pension 
plan they want to take away vacations and eliminate overtime 
pay Cornette said 
Officials of the marinetowing companies refused to comment 
Salaries for Local 333 members range from 385 a day for 
captains to 175 a day for deckhands based on a 12hour day with 
overtime Cornette said He said members earn an average of 35000 
a year 
It was too early to tell how the strike would affect the 
movement of cargo through New York Harbor according to shipping 
officials 
Wed like to make sure the cargo keeps flowing said Gregory 
Storey of the New York Shipping Association an umbrella group for 
shipping companies 
Chief Petty Officer Kirk Wood of the Coast Guards Governors 
Island station said safety zones were being established in New 
YorkNew Jersey waters This means any ship of 1600 gross tons or 
more must check in with the Coast Guards Vessel Traffic Service 
before moving in or out of the area 
Wood also said it appeared that large ships were avoiding New 
York so they would not get stuck here without towing service 
The last tug strike in the New York area ended in June 1979 
after 88 days
