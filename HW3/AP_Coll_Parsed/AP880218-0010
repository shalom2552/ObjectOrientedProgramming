The overall percentage is still tiny just 47 
But that represents a big increase of 33 percent in the number of 
black children attending private schools over a decade and a half 
Black enrollment in Catholic schools was even more remarkable 
growing from 48 percent in 1971 to 85 percent in 1985 according 
to the National Association of Independent Schools Two stories 
report on such schools in Georgia and in Arkansas

Happy noises hum down the halls of the 
Progressive Christian Academy and filter into the paneled office 
Principal Betty Tolbert stops her paperwork to listen attentively 
A substantial grayhaired woman she seems frozen in her swivel 
chair as she strains to catch the sounds coming from the 
classrooms a buzz of song recitation and prayer 
Relaxing after a moment she nods approvingly A smile melts the 
concentration that had creased her forehead 
Yes she says Its a good sound the sound of children 
learning 
A bell rings and the halls are filled with children The girls 
are immaculately dressed in green plaid jumpers and white blouses 
The boys wear green pants white shirts and black ties 
The children have something in common besides the uniforms All 
482 have dark skins 
Welcome to the Progressive Christian Academy the only 
largescale allblack private Christian school I know of said 
Mrs Tolbert the 53yearold founder and driving force behind the 
school Our motto is All things are possible within the Lord 
The nonprofit academy is housed in a onestory brick building 
atop a hill near downtown Macon Until 1983 the building was a 
public elementary school Progressive Christian is leasing it with 
an option to buy 
Youre looking at a miracle here Mrs Tolbert said proudly 
as she walked down the hall past photographs of the Rev Martin 
Luther King Jr Diana Ross and Bill Cosby This place was a 
total wreck when we moved in 18 months ago Now were a family 
Were also a vital education center that is serving the needs of 
black children 
Mrs Tolbert said she came to perceive those needs in the 18 
years she was a public schoolteacher and principal 
It was clear to me that the public school system wasnt 
providing the moral guidance the loving discipline and the 
positive selfimage reinforcement that many children need in order 
to flourish she said 
In the summer of 1985 Betty Tolbert took the plunge with 
50000 in savings and loans She opened a trial summer school at 
the Progressive Baptist Church where her husband is pastor 
We had 75 children and taught remedial reading and math with 
an emphasis on Christian principles and the development of positive 
selfesteem she said It was incredible I began to see a 
change in those children on a daily basis and so did their parents 
They kept telling me their kids were so excited about the school 
that they didnt even have to get them up in the mornings 
That fall I quit my job as principal of an integrated public 
magnet school and opened this school which goes from K4 
prekindergarten through the eighth grade We started with 175 
students By the summer of 86 we had 400 students enrolled and 
had to move out of the church Now with 482 students and 38 
employees weve got cramped quarters once again 
The Progressive Christian Academy is one of four mostly black 
private schools including a tiny class run by Seventhday 
Adventists in Bibb County Some 5000 of the countys 30000 
schoolage children attend private schools most of them white 
Most of our children came to us from the public schools where 
many were doing poorly she said They were developing poor 
selfimages and their parents were afraid their children were going 
to be lost 
Kendall Reid a sixthgrader feels he was one such student 
I was a little mouse I was so scared I just couldnt speak 
up he recalled of his three years in public school I had a 
white teacher in the first grade who told my parents I was 
retarded She and the kids used to make fun of me Now Im on the 
honor roll and I know Im not retarded 
Other students said they had to work harder at Progressive 
Christian and had fewer social and athletic activities yet still 
preferred their private school to public classrooms 
The kids here arent as mad as they were in public school 
said Latonya Raines an eighthgrader And the teachers really 
seem to care about you here 
Bibb County Commissioner William Randall who worked to 
integrate the countys schools two decades ago said he found the 
present situation ironic 
Ive got two grandchildren in Mrs Tolberts school including 
a grandson who wasnt doing well in public school Randall said 
My grandson is doing much better now that hes in the private 
school 
Mrs Tolbert said her school in addition to providing a 
Christian atmosphere gives the children positive role models 
They get to see black people in charge she said We also 
strive to instill in them the belief that everybody is somebody 
special We stress the worth of the individual 
She said her school also accommodates the students special 
needs and schedules 
For one thing she said were open from 6 am until 6 
pm which especially helps single parents We provide a warm 
loving atmosphere but we also stress academics and have volunteer 
tutors for highrisk failures Then too we supervise the homework 
of those students who stay after school 
She said the parents pay 30 a week for one child and 50 for 
two or more They must provide books uniforms and lunches for 
their children 
Several mothers interviewed as a group agreed they were 
thrilled with the school even though tuition money is hard to spare 
My little boy is happy now There hasnt been a day he hasnt 
gotten up and gotten himself ready for school Morning can be an 
especially tense time for a single parent and I simply cant tell 
you how much this means to me said Natalie Coggins a Social 
Security claims examiner with two children at the school 
Mrs Tolbert said parents of eighthgraders want her to offer 
high school classes so children wont have to return to public 
school 
Im also getting requests from parents outside the area to 
start a boarding school she added Id like to do that but 
first we need to raise enough money to pay off our bills and 
complete our library which we need to do to be fully accredited 
The school now has provisional accreditation and plans a library 
fundraising drive 
I feel certain these things will all come in time Meanwhile 
I must be doing something right Its all I can do when I go out 
in the hall not to get knocked down by all the hugs I get
