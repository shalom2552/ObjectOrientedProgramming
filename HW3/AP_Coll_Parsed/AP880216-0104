New Hampshires survivors turn South on Wednesday for the next 
major battleground of the presidential campaign with Tennessean 
Albert Gore Jr hoping to waylay the frontrunners on his home 
ground but Northerner Michael Dukakis saying he is conceding 
nothing 
Among the Republicans George Bush is counting on superior 
organization in the South to hold off Bob Dole and Pat Robertson 
is hoping a strong showing in South Carolina can give him a boost 
heading into the Super Tuesday primaries 
Democrat Dukakis the Massachusetts governor said Tuesday in 
New Hampshire Were going to contest every one of those states 
I think were going to surprise some people in the South 
Jesse Jackson a Southerner like Gore was welcoming the change 
of scenery to a region where he has been at or near the top in 
polls of Democratic voters His support is particularly strong 
among Southern blacks 
After New Hampshire several candidates were heading to South 
Dakota and Wyoming where lowerstake contests are scheduled between 
now and March 8 
But it is on that date known as Super Tuesday that more than 
onethird of the states will vote including most of the South in 
the closest thing ever to a national presidential primary And most 
of the candidates are responding by turning their attention time 
and money southward for what Gore called the main event of the 
campaign 
What they will find is a massive territory where a thorough 
television campaign means buying airtime in 20 or more separate TV 
markets Thats an enormous expense and obstacle particularly for 
those such as Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon who are saddled with 
debt 
Gore the Tennessee senator who claimed a pass to Super Tuesday 
regardless of New Hampshires verdict said in Washington on 
Tuesday that Jackson would be his principal competitor in the South 
He criticized Jacksons defensecut proposals said his own 
experience was more directly relevant and said Democrats in 
all parts of the country are really hungry for a victory in 1988 
and interested in finding a nominee who can offer the best chance 
of beating the Republicans in the fall 
Jackson in recent speeches has argued against what he says is 
a common though oftenunspoken view that he cannot win in 1988 
because he is black no matter how well he does in the South and 
elsewhere 
On the Republican side Robertson was pointing to South 
Carolinas GOP contest on the Saturday before Super Tuesday The 
expected low turnout of that primary combined with Robertsons 
constituency of fundamentalist Christian voters made that 
Biblebelt state a likely spot for another strong showing by the 
former television preacher 
While Dole engaged Bush in the New Hampshire primary the vice 
president was said to have a far superior organization throughout 
the South It was a strong Southern organization in a much more 
limited regional primary that rescued former Vice President 
Walter Mondales nomination hopes after he fell short in New 
Hampshire in 1984 
Still Bill Brock Doles campaign manager said of the Bush 
campaigns claim to have a firewall of support in Southern 
states Its made of straw Straw burns pretty fast 
Gephardt the Democratic winner in Iowas caucuses last week 
seemed a likely candidate to oppose Gore for the 
moderatetoconservative Southern Democratic and independent vote 
that Gore has been trying to appeal to since laying out relatively 
conservative stands on defense and foreign policy issues last fall 
Dukakis has a strong Southern organization and was seen as 
particularly strong in Florida 
I think Gephardt is the one with the most potential to do well 
among Southern white voters besides Gore said Merle Black a 
University of North Carolina political scientist 
He can take votes away from Gore said Claibourne Darden an 
Atlantabased polltaker and analyst 
Facing that possibility Gore had begun stressing an appeal to 
bluecollar voters in contrast to his earlier strategy of 
concentrating on endorsements from the Southern political 
establishment 
He toured a mill in North Carolina last week and stood in a 
Virginia train yard with Johnny Cash where he shouted This party 
and our country has to stand up for the average working men and 
women 
The Southern campaign will include at least three Republican 
debates and four among the Democrats 
Dukakis has been the most successful fundraiser among the 
Democratic candidates and thus at an advantage in the Southern TV 
wars But Gores campaign has been hoarding its money and he said 
he will spend at least 2 million in the region 
Gore campaign manager Fred Martin said We must do well on 
Super Tuesday theres no ifs ands or buts about it We have a 
threeweek campaign
