If theres anything local school boards 
usually dont like its orders from above But many are finding 
they need strong state leadership to overcome community obstacles 
to teaching children about AIDS 
This is a unique situation said Katherine Fraser 
codirector of the AIDS education project at the National 
Association of State Boards of Education 
In a lot of instances state requirements are resented and are 
counterproductive said Fraser But this is a case where many 
local boards are facing opposition in their communities and theyre 
looking to the state for a requirement They want to go back to the 
community and say Look this is something were required to do 
Lets figure out how 
Eighteen states require that schoolchildren be taught about the 
incurable disease the school boards group found in a survey last 
December Among those without specific AIDS education requirements 
are some states with high concentrations of AIDS cases including 
California New Jersey and Florida 
Fraser predicted a flurry of activity in many states in the next 
few months not all of it constructive 
There are states where legislators are putting bill after bill 
in front of the legislature and some of them are not well 
considered she said The people putting them forward are not 
really familiar with the facts Theres a great deal of confusion 
about what ought to be done 
One state Alabama has a mandatory statewide AIDS curriculum 
But most educators and health professionals including the national 
Centers for Disease Control say the key to a successful program is 
broad community involvement 
Theres nothing wrong with saying there are the topics you 
have to cover But getting into curriculum that should be local 
said Fraser If parents and the community dont support what the 
schools are teaching the program wont work Kids have to be 
getting the same education at home and at church as they are at 
school for it to work 
Kansas is a state with what some experts consider a model 
policy The state board requires AIDS instruction and teacher 
training The general goal is to promote sexual abstinence and 
fidelity But what is taught who teaches it and how it is taught 
are decisions made at the local level 
Local school boards were not offering AIDS education because 
of local pressure opposing it Kansas state board member Connie 
Hubbell told a House committee last week I dont think that 
local districts would be teaching about AIDS now without strong 
state leadership on the issue 
Hubbell said AIDS education ideally should be within the context 
of health instruction because if students dont understand germs 
and the immune system they will not understand AIDS and how to 
avoid it 
But if schools dont already have a comprehensive health 
program they cant afford to wait Young people need information 
about AIDS now said Hubbell a member of the board of directors 
of the state school boards group 
Simply requiring AIDS instruction is not enough Hubbell added 
She said few states have provided funds for their education 
efforts few have figured out how to reach youths at high risk of 
infection many of whom are not in school and few have systems to 
evaluate and monitor the success of AIDS education in local schools 
Hubbell said public misconceptions even among policymakers are 
a formidable barrier to the development of successful AIDS 
education programs For example she said a 1987 survey of 
California school principals in 47 districts showed that most could 
not correctly answer more than seven of 14 factual questions about 
AIDS 
The state school boards group and two other national education 
groups have received grants this year from the Centers for Disease 
Control to help states develop or strengthen AIDS prevention 
policies 
The grants are part of the 30 million CDC will spend this year 
on state prevention efforts targeted at schoolage and college 
youth Financial and technical help will be available to all state 
departments of education a CDC official told a House committee 
last week 
The center publishes a bibliography of AIDS teaching resources 
and last month published Guidelines for School Health Education 
to Prevent the Spread of AIDS The guidelines recommend broad 
community participation and prescribe instruction in preventive 
behavior ranging from abstinence to condom use The guidelines also 
graphically describe what students should know at various age 
levels
