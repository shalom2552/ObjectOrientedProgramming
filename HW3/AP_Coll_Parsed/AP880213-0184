A team of engineers has urged NASA to change 
the heatresistant lining on the nozzle of the space shuttles 
booster rockets because of questions about the materials 
durability a published report said Sunday 
Four of the six engineers who took part in the study believe 
that the lining could produce a borderline performance and 
should be altered before the next shuttle flight scheduled for 
August The Washington Post reported 
The two other researchers dissented stating that the problem 
was not quite so serious 
Tests have resulted in fractures so numerous so large so 
closely spaced and so extensive that the integrity of the entire 
nozzle came into question said the scientists study obtained 
by the Post 
The report was prepared by a team of engineers from Morton 
Thiokol Inc the shuttle rockets manufacturer and from the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration It was presented to 
NASA two weeks ago 
The nozzle is a sort of exhaust pipe at the bottom of the 
shuttles two booster rockets more than 12 feet in diameter 
through which superhot gases are blasted during liftoff 
The nozzles interior is coated with an inchthick 
carbonandresin material in which NASA scientists have noted 
erosion in flights as long ago as 1983 
The report blames the erosion on excessive water and gases 
trapped in the material during its manufacture and recommends 
changes in processing techniques 
But one of the two dissenting engineers former Thiokol engineer 
GC Lamere wrote that the changes would unnecessarily 
increase costs and that there is insignificant data to show 
that they would be effective
