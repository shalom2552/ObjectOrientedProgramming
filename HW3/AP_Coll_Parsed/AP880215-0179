Vice President George Bush pulling out all 
the stops in his bid to block Bob Dole from a second straight 
victory campaigned Monday on the eve of New Hampshires primary 
with conservative hero Barry Goldwater 
I believe in George Bush Hes the man to continue the 
conservative revolution we started 24 years ago Goldwater the 
partys 1964 nominee said in a campaign ad Hes the 
bestqualified candidate for president in my lifetime other than 
me George 
In a furious day of campaigning Bush said he has turned the 
tide that began running against him with Doles victory last week 
in the Iowa caucuses 
Im going to win tomorrow Believe me Bush told one campus 
rally discounting polls that gave Dole a small lead 
In the fiveminute commercial with Goldwater the vice president 
added I sense a rising tideWith your help it will carry me 
to the White House 
In the electioneve ad taped and broadcast Monday Bush 
suggested Dole is too much a creature of Washington carry on the 
Reagan revolution 
This election is really a question Who can you most trust to 
continue the Reagan revolution Who can you rely on to build on 
what we have done Bush said in the ad 
Bush slammed Dole for backing an oil import fee and suggested 
Dole would raise taxes in other ways if elected 
My closest opponent Sen Dole says he believes in our 
revolutionSen Dole is a popular and respected figure in 
Washington But thats where the pressure is most intense to 
repudiate Reaganism with a tax hike Bush said 
Goldwater 79 the retired senator flew six hours from his home 
in Arizona to be at Bushs side on the final day of the primary 
campaign 
I served with Bob Dole for many many years in the Senate 
said Goldwater who walked with a cane I think hes done a very 
good job But running the political affairs of 47 people in the 
Senate is not like running the lives or helping in running the 
lives of 250 millionodd people 
Dole shrugged off the Goldwater endorsement saying He cant 
vote in this state 
Legendary Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams the Hall of Fame 
outfielder also posed at a news conference with the vice president 
Gov John Sununu of New Hampshire Bushs state chairman said 
Sundays night debate turned the tide He said the polls show 
great movement since the debate The polls are catching up with 
reality Were ahead Were going to win 
Bush said Monday morning in a television interview that Dole was 
making the same mistake Bush himself made in 1980 when he thought 
that winning the Iowa caucuses would give him the momentum to carry 
New Hampshire Ronald Reagan soundly defeated Bush here eight years 
ago after being upset in Iowa 
I want New Hampshire to do what it did in 1980 Bush 
said on the CBS Morning News Bob Dole is talking momentum and 
Im talking issues on taxes and holding the line on the oil import 
fee and on presidential leadership and I think its working so I 
want New Hampshire to correct Iowas mistakes 
Bushs once strong lead in New Hampshire polls has evaporated 
and polls now show the race as a virtual dead heat between the vice 
president and Dole 
Bush who finished third in Iowa behind Dole and Pat Robertson 
called Doles proposal for a budget freeze a copout because it 
avoids the tough decisions 
Speaking to elderly residents at a nursing home Bush called 
Doles plan a straitjacket that would limit Social Security 
costofliving increases to two percent 
Dole has said a two percent COLA cap is one possibility but he 
has also suggested exempting Social Security from a freeze 
Bush said his own leadership freeze would achieve a balanced 
budget by 1993 without touching Social Security or raising taxes 
Crowds were sparse on this Washingtons Birthday holiday morning 
as Bush informally dressed in a blue ski jacket made three 
breakfast stops 
He joined two families on a ski trip at a Bickfords Family 
Restaurant for pancakes and bacon sipped coffee with the customers 
at a Dunkin Donuts and s while chatting with an army sergeant
