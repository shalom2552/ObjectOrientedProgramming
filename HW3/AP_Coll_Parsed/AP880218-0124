3 Strict observance of allocations During the 1980s an 
unacceptable budget practice evolved within the Congress of 
disregarding congressionally approved function allocations Funds 
regularly were shifted from defense or international affairs to 
domestic spending I strongly urge that each fiscal year separate 
national security and domestic allocations be made and enforced 
through a point of order provision in the Budget Act 
4 Enhanced rescission authority Under current law the 
president may propose rescissions of budget authority but both 
Houses of Congress must act favorably for the rescission to 
take effect In 1987 not a single rescission was enacted or even 
voted on before expiration of the 45day deadline I propose a 
change of law that would require the Congress to vote up or 
down on any presidentially proposed rescission thereby 
preventing the Congress from ducking the issue by simply ignoring 
the proposed rescission and avoiding a recorded vote 
5 Biennial budgeting The current budget process consumes too 
much time and energy A twoyear budget cycle offers several 
advantages among them a reduction in repetitive annual budget 
tasks more time for consideration of key spending decisions in 
reconciliation and less scope for gimmicks such as shifting 
spending from one year to the next I call on the Congress to adopt 
biennial budgeting 
6 Truth in federal spending As part of my Economic Bill of 
Rights I will shortly transmit legislation that will require any 
future legislation creating new federal programs to be 
deficitneutral In addition to requiring the concurrent enactment 
of equal amounts of program reductions or revenue increases my 
proposal would require that all future legislation and regulations 
be accompanied by financial impact statements including the effect 
on state and local governments 
Adoption of these reforms should enable the federal government 
to make informed decisions in a deliberate fashion that fosters 
rational priorities The American people deserve no less from their 
elected representatives

Looking back over the past seven years we can feel a sense of 
pride in our accomplishments Important tasks remain however The 
large and stubbornly persistent budget deficit has been a major 
source of frustration It threatens our prosperity and our hopes 
for lessening the burden on future generations 
Two years ago the legislative and executive branches of 
government responded to this threat by enacting the GRH Act 
which mandated gradual orderly progress toward a balanced budget 
over the next several years My budget achieves the 1989 target of 
the amended act while preserving legitimate programs for the aged 
and needy providing for adequate national security devoting more 
resources to other highpriority activities and doing so without 
raising taxes 
My budget also embodies the Bipartisan Budget Agreement reached 
last November In presenting this budget I am keeping my end of 
the bargain I call upon the Congress to uphold its end by 
ensuring that appropriations and other legislation are in full 
accord with the agreement By exercising this measure of restraint 
and selfdiscipline we can secure great benefits for the nation a 
lower budget deficit reduced demand on credit markets more stable 
financial markets a steadily declining trade deficit and 
continued prosperity with noninflationary growth And by 
reforming the budget process the Congress can improve its 
decisionmaking and garner the thanks of a grateful public Surely 
these are small prices for what is at stake
