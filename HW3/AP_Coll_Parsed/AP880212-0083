About 500 people demonstrated outside the 
headquarters of an electric power company in southwestern Japan 
Friday protesting a test at a nuclear power reactor 
Some of the demonstrators had stayed overnight at the site after 
attending a rally Thursday that police said drew 1500 people 
The protesters at the headquarters in Takamatsu of the Shikoku 
Elecric Power Co opposed an output test at the companys nuclear 
reactor at Ikata that was conducted Friday 
Takamatsu is 340 miles southwest of Tokyo and Ikata is 115 miles 
southwest of Takamatsu 
Sueaki Maekawa a member of a local antinuclear group said 
The protest action was initiated by ordinary people such as 
housewives who have no affiliation with big organizations It is 
really encouraging 
Police spokesman Yasunori Aya said about 300 police officers 
were sent to the demonstration Friday to keep order The protesters 
were noisy but not violent and there were no arrests he said 
A Shikoku company official said that in the test the reactors 
output was reduced by 50 percent over a period of three hours The 
official speaking with the condition he not be identified said 
the test was made to collect data on rapid reactor output shifts 
dealing with the fluctuating demand for power 
Protesters said the test was similar to one conducted at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power complex in the Soviet Union on April 26 
1986 that resulted in a fire and the worlds worst nuclear 
accident The Soviets said at least 31 people perished from the 
fire or radiation 
The company official said the tests were different He said the 
Soviets tried to stop the turbine completely and the Japanese test 
only involved a 50 percent cutback 
He said the Soviets also disconnected safety devices at the 
Chernobyl plant while the devices at the Ikata reactor remained in 
operation 
The Kyodo News Service quoted Soichiro Ito directorgeneral of 
Science and Technology Agency as saying there was was no cause for 
concern about the safety of the test
