GAF Corps decision to exempt itself from 
Delawares new antitakeover law reflects its own acquisitive 
philosophy rather than a groundswell of corporate opposition to the 
statute experts say 
GAF said Tuesday its board of directors voted to opt out of 
takeover protections included in the controversial law making it 
the first major corporation to do so since the law took effect 
earlier this month 
The company is considering a 12 billion buyout offer from a 
group led by chairman Samuel J Heyman who has steered the 
chemical and building materials company through two major takeover 
battles as part of its acquisitive corporate strategy 
In proposing a buyout last September Heyman said the move would 
allow GAF to pursue its takeover strategy without having to worry 
about the shortterm earnings pressures faced by many publiclyheld 
companies 
The managementled group has offered 40 in cash and 850 worth 
of debt securities for each of GAFs roughly 277 million common 
shares outstanding Heyman who also is GAFs chief executive 
controls about 10 percent of the outstanding shares 
GAF stock rose 50 cents to close at 4762 a share Tuesday on 
the New York Stock Exchange 
The company is based in Wayne NJ but is incorporated in 
Delaware as are more than half of the Fortune 500 companies 
A key provision of the new Delaware law would bar a potential 
buyer from acquiring a company for three years after the buyer 
accumulated more than 15 percent of the target companys stock The 
provision would not apply if the buyer acquired a total of 85 
percent of the companys shares in the same transaction that it 
passed the 15 percent threshold or if the board of directors 
approved the takeover 
The provision was aimed at bustup deals where a hostile 
buyer sells off chunks of a target company in order to help finance 
the buyout and partial offers where the buyer acquires just enough 
shares to win control of the target and offers the remaining 
shareholders a lesser price for their stock 
Statechartered companies have 90 days from the laws effective 
date to exempt themselves from the law After the 90day period a 
corporation may exempt itself only by a shareholders vote 
Campeau Corp and Black amp Decker Corp which have made pending 
hostile buyout offers for Delawareincorporated companies have 
filed lawsuits challenging the new law as unconstitutional 
In announcing the GAF boards action Heyman criticized the law 
as an example of the proliferation of state antitakeover laws 
which he said helped entrench managements at the expense of 
shareholders 
This is an expression of our companys corporate governance 
philosophy Heyman said in a telephone interview And we simply 
wanted to lend support to the effort in Congress for federal 
preemption of state antitakeover laws 
GAF also released a letter from Heyman urging David S Ruder 
chairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to 
press Congress to preempt antitakeover legislation in the states 
The GAF management groups buyout bid is unlikely to turn 
hostile but the Delaware law could impede Heymans takeover 
strategy by putting restraints on GAF attempts to acquire other 
companies 
Last year GAF made an unsuccessful hostile bid for BorgWarner 
Corp which eventually agreed to a buyout by a group led by the 
investment firm Merrill Lynch amp Co 
In late 1985 GAF made an unsuccessful but highly profitable 
attempt to take over Union Carbide Corp GAF withdrew after Union 
Carbide undertook a major defensive restructuring but made about 
250 million in profit by selling the Carbide stock it had 
accumulated 
GAFs decision to exempt itself probably does not signal a trend 
among Delawareincorporated companies experts said 
Many of the thousands of major companies incorporated in 
Delaware pushed for approval of the law and are deemed unlikely to 
forego its protection
