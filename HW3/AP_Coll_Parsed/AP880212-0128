Gillette Co which has fought off cosmetic giant 
Revlon Co repeatedly is now being chased by a group led by 
Coniston Partners 
Coniston subsidiary RB Partners has accumulated 676 million 
Gillette shares or about 58 percent of the companys roughly 
1159 million shares outstanding the group disclosed Thursday 
Coniston a partnership that was instrumental in the breakup of 
Allegis Corp indicated it would like to meet with Gillette said 
Paul E Tierney Jr Coniston general partner 
Failing that Tierney said Coniston may meet with potential 
buyers of Gillette stock in an attempt to seek representation for 
the upcoming board of directors annual meeting in April 
We dont want to break up Gillette Tierney said The 
smartest thing would be to see the company purchased by another 
entity 
Coleman Mockler Gillettes chairman and chief executive said 
in a prepared statement RB Partners appears to be trying to 
pressure the Gillette directors into putting the company up for 
sale and to stir up renewed speculation in Gillette stock 
The directors have consistently stated the view that Gillette 
has a bright future as an independent company the statement said 
The Coniston group said it acquired the shares because it 
believed they were undervalued Coniston also indicated it would 
attempt to meet with Gillette management to determine the steps the 
company would take to boost its stock price 
But according to the Gillette release the company was satisfied 
that a recent restructuring was sufficiently boosting shareholder 
values and it would not be pressured into giving up its 
independence 
Shearson Lehman analyst Andres Shore said if Coniston pursued a 
proxy fight against Gillette management it might find support in 
the many institutions that hold company stock 
Thursdays disclosure came after several days of renewed 
takeover speculation surrounding Gillette that sent the consumer 
products companys stock shooting higher 
Gillette rose 362 to 41 a share in active New York Stock 
Exchange trading Thursday 
The group stated it might meet with potential acquirers to 
determine their interest in buying Gillette and to compare the 
price they might offer against the benefits of a management plan 
Bostonbased Gillette long has been the object of takeover 
speculation Over the past two years the company has spurned 
several takeover offers from Revlon Group Inc the latest a 541 
billion proposal 
The companies signed a standstill agreement in November 1986 
after Revlon acquired a 14 percent take in Gillette and made its 
initial unsuccessful offer for a 412 billion buyout The pact 
prohibits Revlon from launching a tender offer without the consent 
of Gillettes board of directors which adamantly has opposed 
takeover overtures 
After rebuffing Revlon in 1986 Gillette undertook a 
restructuring that included layoffs of about 2400 workers and the 
sale of a number of its smaller businesses 
Last November the company announced a reorganization that split 
it into two main units one for its North American and European 
razor razor blade personal products and stationary products 
businesses and the other for international and diversified units 
Conistons moves indicated it believed Gillette was worth more 
than the stock market had valued it and the group might realize a 
bigger profit from the proceeds of a buyout breakup or other 
restructuring than it would from a longterm rise in the companys 
stock price 
Keith Gollust a general partner in the group declined to 
identify the parties deemed potential buyers for Gillette although 
rumored acquirers in the past have included the British 
conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC and Unilever NV the AngloDutch 
consumer products company
