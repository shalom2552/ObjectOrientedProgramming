The normally staid community of French philosophers 
is in an uproar over the Nazi past of Martin Heidegger the late 
West German whose philosophy had a wide following in France 
Specialists have long known that Heidegger whose classic 
Being and Time in 1927 influenced a whole generation of 
existentialist philosophers was once a member of the Nazi Party 
It has not been clear just how deep his fascist sympathies ran 
or how his disciples contributed knowingly or unknowingly to 
protecting his reputation 
Heidegger one of the ranking philosophers of the 20th century 
has been a particularly dominant figure in France where his 
writings helped shape the thought of JeanPaul Sartre and other 
thinkers 
Twelve years after his death his standing is now threatened by 
the mushrooming controversy which focuses on the question Were 
Heideggers Nazi ties a matter of opportunism selfpreservation 
and a weak character or a poisonous reflection of his lifelong 
belief in the superiority of the German people language and 
culture 
The book Heidegger and Nazism by Victor Farias a Chilean 
philosopher and former student of Heidegger at the University of 
Freiburg in Germany goes far beyond anything previously published 
about the German thinker 
Farias found documents indicating that Heidegger was a 
cardcarrying duespaying member of the Nazi Party until 1945 the 
year World War II ended He argues that Heidegger acted not out of 
circumstance or opportunism but out of a commitment to the 
principles of National Socialism elitism discrimination and 
antiSemitism 
He further maintains that Heidegger resigned as rector of the 
University of Freiburg in 1934 not because official university 
policy was proNazi but because it was too moderate Farias says 
others later became the official party ideologues at the university 
only because Heidegger was considered too radical 
While reaction to Farias book has been loud and varied French 
philosophers are perhaps most troubled by the idea that Heideggers 
Nazi beliefs are the underpinnings of his thought 
Francois Fedier a devoted Heideggerian called Ferias book a 
shameless falsification and accused the author of tampering 
with documents 
Heidegger was not a hero but neither was he the partisan 
activist and antiSemitic denouncer of Jews who emerges from the 
imaginary portrait painted by Victor Farias Fedier wrote in the 
latest issue of Debat a philosophy journal 
Fedier did not deny Heideggers attraction to Nazism but called 
it merely a serious error in judgment Heidegger did not see how 
dangerous Hitler was He let himself be fooled 
In two recently published books the French deconstructionist 
Jacques Derrida traced the links between Heideggerian thought and 
Nazism Critics praised the strength of Derridas analysis but 
said he did not go far enough 
One would have liked to see Derrida express his own moral 
indignation wrote Robert Maggiori in the newspaper Liberation 
Why be so polite Why does Heideggers work like a sword 
command its victims respect 
Farias is less polite He devotes a chapter to Heideggers first 
essay written in 1910 which extols the virtues of Abraham a 
Sancta Clara a 17th century Viennese monk known for his virulent 
antiSemitism and xenophobia 
Important people like Abraham a Sancta Clara should remain 
alive in our hearts working silently in the soul of the people 
Heidegger wrote then Heidegger discussed Sancta Clara again in 
1964 and was no less laudatory 
Heideggers later work denounced dehumanization in modern 
society Yet as Farias and others including Maurice Blanchot and 
Philippe LacoueLabarthe point out he never denounced the 
Holocaust or uttered a single word of sorrow or regret over the 
death of millions of Jews 
Heideggers irreparable mistake was his silence on The 
Extermination Blanchot wrote in a letter published in Le Nouvel 
Observateur a French weekly 
The controversy has also spread to Germany where Farias is a 
professor at the Free University of Berlin His book appeared first 
in Paris only after being rejected twice by West German publishers 
The liberal weekly Die Zeit of Hamburg in a recent article on 
the furor describes Heidegger as a scared opportunist and 
not the hero type but says he was not an antiSemite and 
questions whether he thought as a Nazi acted as a Nazi 
philosophically justified the Nazi business 
The affair has had a much higher profile in Paris perhaps 
because Heidegger has not been as influential a figure in postwar 
German thought as he has been in France 
In 1934 Heidegger was photographed wearing a Nazi badge and was 
quoted as saying The Fuehrer himself and alone is the present 
and future German reality 
For LacoueLabarthe Heideggers commitment to National 
Socialism is absolutely coherent with his thinking 
In his recent book The Fiction of Politics LacoueLabarthe 
quotes Heidegger as comparing agriculture a motorized food 
industry to the fabrication of cadavers in the gas chambers 
and extermination camps the blockade of countries reduced to 
famine and the building of hydrogen bombs 
Michel Deguy a leftist philosopher also writing in Debat 
argued that Farias disclosures have been common knowledge for 
years He called the book weak conceptually and analytically 
and said it gained attention only through the mass media
