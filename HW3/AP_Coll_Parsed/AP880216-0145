The AFLCIO on Tuesday condemned 
Israels use of excessive force against Palestinian civilians 
on the Israelioccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip its firstever 
rebuke of Israel 
The condemnation was issued by the 143millionmember labor 
federations executive council an hour after meeting with Secretary 
of State George Shultz Shultz is scheduled to make a weeklong 
visit to the Middle East Feb 24 to promote new negotiations 
between Israel and Jordan on Palestinian selfrule 
The AFLCIO blamed Islamic fundamentalists for fueling the 
flames of violence in the occupied territories but said the 
Palestinian demonstrations did not warrant unnecessary force used 
by Israeli defense forces 
No doubt such incidents can be attributed to the inexperience 
of the Israeli army in riot control and other police functions and 
to the frustrations of Israeli soldiers as they confront young 
Palestinians hurling stones and petrol bombs the federation 
said These factors may explain but they cannot excuse and the 
AFLCIO cannot condone the use of excessive force against 
civilians 
The federation however rejected what it called a notion that 
Israel must now redeem itself by turning the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip over to the Palestine Liberation Organization More than 50 
Palestinians have been killed and thousands of others have been 
injured or arrested by Israeli forces in the occupied territories 
since early December 
Rex Hardesty a spokesman for the labor federation said it is 
the first time the AFLCIO has made any criticism of an Israeli 
action They havent crushed childrens hands before he said 
The annual winter meeting of the labor leaders here was Shultzs 
last stop of an extended weekend in southern Florida to gain 
support from traditional friends of Israel for his effort to soften 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamirs opposition to entering new 
peace negotiations 
Shultz addressed a meeting of the BNai Brith AntiDefamation 
League in Palm Beach on Friday seeking help from the US Jewish 
community in pressing Shamir to show more flexibility 
Theres been so much emphasis on the process direct 
negotiations on the one hand an international conference or some 
kind of international vehicle on the other that the discussion 
has become a little sterile he said Tuesday If we are going 
to get going we need to talk a little bit more about the substance 
of what might happen
