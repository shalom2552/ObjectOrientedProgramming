Soviet firefighters overseen by Americans 
extinguished a fire Wednesday in the US Embassy the aging 
building the United States has been unable to abandon because of 
bugging devices that riddle a new structure 
About 150 embassy employees were evacuated and sent home for the 
day embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert said No one was injured 
US Embassy officials said Soviet firefighters were called to 
put out the fire in an unoccupied fifthfloor residential section 
after they decided embassy personnel couldnt extinguish it on 
their own 
The Soviets responded promptly and were escorted at all times 
by American employees inside the building said Gilbert who 
briefed reporters in the wet snow outside the mustardcolored 
embassys main door after the fire had been brought under control 
The 10story embassy building on busy Tchaikovsky Street near 
the center of Moscow has been the source of controversy for more 
than a year 
Last spring US officials said they had determined a new 
eightstory redbrick office building directly behind the old one 
could not be occupied immediately because of Soviet listening 
devices apparently installed during construction 
The 191 million structure already was five years behind 
schedule at the time Proposals have included razing part or all of 
the new structure or building a new office to house communications 
and secret operations 
US Reps Dan Mica DFla and Olympia Snowe RMaine said in 
April that the old embassy building rented by the United States 
since the early 1950s was a firetrap and unsafe by accepted 
standards for general working conditions 
A renovation of the building has been under way since then 
Gilbert said the fire might be construction related 
although its cause has not been determined It apparently started 
near a stairwell he said 
He said there was no damage to the main working areas of the 
embassy which begins on the sixth floor 
Embassy Second Secretary Michael Hurley who was in his 
eighthfloor office at the time of the blaze said the smell of 
smoke increased before he evacuated 
Somebody came through shouting excitedly Theres a fire 
everybody out of the building Hurley said 
He said he locked up his safe and left the building by a stairs 
that normally is closed The lower I went the more smoke I could 
see he said 
People were excited but there was an orderly exit Hurley 
said 
Embassy employees gathered in the rear courtyard to watch the 
blaze Flames were leaping out of the building Obviously it was 
a very hot fire and it was coming out of one window Hurley said 
Ambassador Jack Matlock was away from the embassy at the time 
but was alerted and returned to the site Gilbert said 
Last fall employees underwent fire drills conducted by State 
Department experts Hurley said 
Viktor Kononov Moscows fire chief told the Tass news agency 
that firefighters responded in four minutes to a call from one of 
the Soviet guards who are stationed outside the embassy 
He said US guards wouldnt let us in for about five minutes 
more they were apparently waiting for clearance from senior 
officials 
Firefighters found three rooms and a small hallway with traces 
of uncompleted repairs were on fire with flames enveloping tables 
chairs and construction garbage he said adding that it was 
extinguished in 20 minutes 
A more serious fire hit the top floors of the building in 1977 
and officials said afterward the damage was severe because 
Ambassador Malcolm Toon refused to permit Soviet firefighters to 
enter the topsecurity embassy communications center and some of 
its most sensitive work areas 
Last spring a scandal erupted around charges that US Marine 
guards had permitted Soviet agents inside secret areas of the 
embassy 
The charges never were proven but Marine Sgt Clayton Lonetree 
was convicted in August of espionage for giving the Soviets embassy 
floor plans and the identities of US intelligence agents after he 
had become sexually involved with a Soviet woman
