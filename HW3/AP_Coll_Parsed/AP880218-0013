The Reagan administration and the oil industry 
have narrowly bested the environmentalists in Round 1 of their 
intense fight over petroleum development in the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge 
The administrations victory came Wednesday as the Senate Energy 
Committee voted 109 to open the 15 millionacre coastal plain to 
oil rigs a controversial step that the Interior Department and Big 
Oil have been urging on Congress for a year 
Under the committees plan drilling rigs could join the caribou 
and musk oxen on the refuges frigid tundra as early as 21 months 
after enactment of a law repealing the current prohibition against 
development in the refuge 
The issue has become a major battleground The environmental 
lobby is trying to protect the fragile ecosystem from any 
development The other side says the areas potentially huge 
reserves could rival those of nearby Prudhoe Bay which accounts 
for about 20 percent of domestic oil production 
Drilling foes like Sen Tim Wirth DColo said that even 
though the committee was readying legislation for the full Senate 
they think they can hold their ground this year in hope that the 
next president will oppose development 
In fact Wirth said Senate action in 1988 may be academic 
Nothings going to happen this year in the House zero The 
Interior Committee isnt going to bring it up 
Syd Butler conservation vice president of the Wilderness 
Society said that while he was disappointed in the committee 
action Im real happy with the division a 109 vote is not a 
clear mandate for opening ANWR 
The American Petroleum Institute the oil industrys lobbying 
arm said in a statement that the committee has taken a step 
toward ensuring the future energy security and economic wellbeing 
of our country The time has come to proceed with the 
legislation We urge the Senate and the House to move 
expeditiously 
Wirth and his allies tried to persuade the committee to defer a 
decision on drilling until the administration could study the 
nations longterm energy needs and formulate a policy to meet them 
But Interior Secretary Donald Hodel the point man for the 
development forces told the committee in a letter that new oil 
from the Arctic is needed under any scenario including increased 
conservation 
Hodel criticized the direction being taken by the committee as 
it continues work on the refuge legislation He objected to 
proposals for detailed environmental safeguards and a 10year 
stretchout in the oiltract leasing process 
Hodel was also critical of a decision made two weeks ago by the 
committee to earmark 80 percent of the federal revenues from refuge 
oil to conservation and species protection programs with only 20 
percent available for general use 
ANWRs resources belong to all Americans Hodel said 
Federal revenues generated by an ANWR leasing program should go 
to the Treasury where they can benefit all taxpayers and serve 
national priorities 
Bob Walker an Interior spokesman said he did not know whether 
Hodels problems with the bill could lead to a recommendation that 
it be vetoed Walker said Interior officials were pleased by 
Wednesdays vote because were still moving in the general 
direction we want to go
