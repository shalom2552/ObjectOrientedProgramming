Belgiums largest insurer Groupe AG 
SA said Monday it raised its offer for rival insurer AssubelVie 
SA by 20 percent to 7200 francs or about 20571 per share 
Groupe AG announced the new bid its second for AssubelVie to 
offset a counteroffer for AssubelVies stock by a group of 
investors backed by AssubelVie 
The new bid which values AssubelVie at almost 9 billion 
francs or about 257 million will be launched Tuesday and run 
through the end of the month Groupe AG said in a statement 
The offer is for all of AssubelVies 124 million shares 
Groupe AG said Assubel Vie is not quoted on the Brussels stock 
exchange 
The sweetened offer is considerably higher than required under 
Belgian takeover regulations which requires offers to increase by 
5 percent 
A Groupe AG official said the company made a higher offer to 
avoid a bidding war 
However AssubelVie Belgiums third largest insurer indicated 
it would continue to resist Groupe AG even though the group 
supported by AssubelVie is offering 6000 francs or 171 per 
share 
The group includes Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA Belgiums second 
largest holding company Assurances Generales de France a 
stateowned French insurer Cobepa a Belgian holding company and 
Cie Generale Mosane 
AssubelVie called in the four companies after Belgiums banking 
commission ruled last month the company had to come up with 
alternative shareholders if it wanted to block Groupe AGs bid 
The groups counteroffer for AssubelVie was launched a week 
ago and expires on Friday
