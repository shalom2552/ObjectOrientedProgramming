The House ethics committee recommended 
Thursday that Rep Mario Biaggi a 10term New York Democrat 
convicted of accepting illegal gratuities be expelled from 
Congress for violating its rules of conduct 
The committee issued a threesentence statement The Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct today filed a report with the 
House recommending that Representative Mario Biaggi of New York be 
expelled The report will be made available as soon as it has been 
printed by the US Government Printing Office Neither the 
committee nor its staff will have any further comment on this 
matter 
Biaggi once the mostdecorated policeman on the New York City 
force could become the first congressman since 1980 and only the 
second since the Civil War to be drummed out of the House 
The committees recommendation must be approved by a twothirds 
majority of the House to become effective 
The last congressman to be expelled was Rep Michael Ozzie 
Myers DPa Myers convicted in the Abscam bribery scandal was 
captured on videotape taking 50000 from an undercover FBI agent 
Before Myers no House member had been expelled since the Civil War 
The committee could have recommended a wide range of sanctions 
including expulsion censure reprimand fine or loss of seniority 
Biaggi 70 pleaded with the ethics committee in December to 
keep his Bronx NY congressional seat His lawyers had asked the 
panel instead to reprimand the congressman chairman Julian Dixon 
DCalif said at the time 
But the committee counsel recommended expulsion and more than a 
month later the members chose to invoke their harshest punishment 
In November two committee lawyers issued a report that said 
Biaggi had discredited the House of Representatives as an 
institution after he was convicted of accepting paid vacations in 
exchange for helping to steer government contracts toward a 
floundering Brooklyn shipyard 
Biaggi was sentenced in November to 2 years in prison and fined 
500000 He is free pending appeal 
Biaggi was convicted in September of illegally accepting paid 
vacations from former Brooklyn Democratic leader Meade Esposito 
Esposito had asked Biaggi to use his influence to help Coastal Dry 
Dock and Repair a shipyard that owed large insurance premiums to 
Espositos brokerage company 
Esposito who was convicted of paying gratuities and of illegal 
interstate travel was sentenced to a twoyear suspended prison 
term He also must pay a fine of 500000 serve two years 
probation and perform 500 hours of community service 
Biaggi faces another trial next month in Manhattan federal court 
on racketeering and bribery charges in a case involving Wedtech 
Corp a Bronx defense contractor
