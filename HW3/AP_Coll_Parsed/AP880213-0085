Obituaries want ads grocery ads 
and all the other news thats fit to print but usually not fit to 
broadcast are the daily staple of one unusual radio service 
The Radio Reading Service of Western Massachusetts exists solely 
to relay nearly every word in area newspapers to those who cant 
read it said its founder and president Katharine Surette 
The service fills a need that even wellmeaning friends and 
relatives cant said Ms Surette who is blind 
When my fiance reads to me on Sundays he reads 
discriminately what he wants to read she said Unless I push 
real hard I dont get all the stories 
At the radio service we dont editorialize We try to read 
everything she said 
The 200 volunteer staff members read entire articles of local 
interest supermarket ads daily lottery payoffs and other 
important tidbits that regular news broadcasts usually skip 
Obituaries are very important to listeners said Ms 
Surette If a friend passes away sometimes they have no other 
way of knowing that Then they also like the lottery numbers They 
always call when we forget to read the payoffs 
Volunteer Edith Favorato 73 said she has been going to the 
studio from her East Longmeadow home every Monday for the past 
three years to read magazine articles and books that are not 
available in recorded form 
I dont know any visually handicapped people but I think I 
can identify with them she said I feel Im doing my little 
bit to bring some happiness to people who might not otherwise have 
it 
A speech by Stanley Potter who began a reading service in 
Minnesota in 1969 inspired Ms Surette to start her own service 
she said After years of pestering Springfield Technical Community 
College for space and equipment she opened the service on the 
campus on Jan 17 1983 
The service had 20 volunteers at the time twice the number of 
listeners 
Anybody who could breathe and speak at the same time was on 
the air she said We dont have to do that anymore We have 
enough volunteers that we can do good training 
The service has since set up an office off campus with a live 
studio two recording booths and eight employees Another studio 
in Dalton provides news from the states westernmost counties 
It is financed largely by state agencies but does conduct 
fundraising campaigns and also receives some donations 
The program can be heard only through special receivers tuned to 
cable television or radio stations Ms Surette said there are 500 
receivers in homes nursing homes and hospitals throughout western 
Massachusetts 
Many of the receivers are donated by local charities loaned to 
listeners by the station or sold at cost about 90 The only 
thing we ask of listeners is that they be in some way print 
handicapped even if that means they cant hold a paper and turn 
the pages Ms Surette said 
Each morning in West Springfield begins with a twohour reading 
of the UnionNews of Springfield for those in and around the 
states thirdlargest city Volunteers in Dalton read The Berkshire 
Eagle and other Berkshire County newspapers The readings are 
repeated every night 
Newsmagazine and weekly newspaper readings are interspersed 
through the week Book readings begin at noon and again at 11 pm 
Usually the less colorful I shouldnt say less colorful maybe 
less offensive books are read during the day said program
