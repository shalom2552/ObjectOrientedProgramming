Wholesale prices rose a brisk 04 percent in 
January as higher food costs more than offset declines in energy 
prices the government said today 
The rise in the Labor Departments Producer Price Index negated 
a 04 percent decline in December and was the steepest monthly 
increase since an identical 04 percent jump in September 
Januarys rise if it persisted for 12 months would amount to 
an annual inflation rate of 46 percent compared with the 22 
percent increase for all of 1987 Economists however still expect 
that wholesale prices will moderate through the balance of 1988 
Food prices increased 17 percent in January rebounding from a 
14 percent decline in December 
Analysts said an insect infestation in California and Arizona 
pushed up vegetable prices while cold weather influenced a rise in 
chicken and pork prices 
The increase included a 162 percent surge vegetable prices 
Lettuce shot up 516 percent in Janaury That comes atop a 105 
percent increase in December and a 954 percent jump in November 
Celery rocketed 441 percent and onions 325 percent 
Prices for pork were up 132 percent egg costs jumped 125 
percent chicken prices went up 56 percent 
Costs also rose for rice macaroni products and fish Declines 
were posted for turkeys off 124 percent and fresh fruits down 
30 percent 
Natural gas prices edged up 08 percent after a 30 percent 
increase in December But steep declines were recorded for other 
forms of energy which overall fell 45 percent compared with a 
decline of 16 percent a month earlier 
Gasoline prices fell 84 percent after dropping 42 percent in 
December Home heating oil costs dropped 62 percent compared with 
a 52 percent fall a month before 
Donald Ratajczak who runs his own inflation surveys as director 
of economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta 
said falling energy prices reflect a little bit of a glut on 
the oil market 
The industry historically takes a long time to adjust its 
production to price changes and there is still some overproduction 
stemming from oil price increases in the early 1980s he said 
Minus the usually volatile food and energy categories the index 
for all other finished goods rose a brisk 05 percent compared 
with a 02 percent increase in December 
Ratajczak said this figure was pushed higher by publishers of 
newspapers and magazines and producers of items sold through 
catalogs who tend to raise their prices once at the beginning of 
each year 
The Labor Department gave these other specifics on January 
wholesale price activity 
New automobile prices were up 02 percent following a 19 
percent drop in December 
Alcoholic beverage costs were up 01 percent after a 03 
percent increase a month earlier 
Household appliance prices were down 02 percent compared with 
an 02 percent increase in December 
Home electronic equipment costs fell 02 percent after dropping 
05 percent earlier 
Gains were also posted for adults and childrens clothing and 
shoes 
The figures are adjusted to remove predictable seasonal price 
fluctuations 
The wholesale price calculation excludes services and imports 
areas of the economy where price increases have been more rapid in 
part because of the falling dollar which makes foreign products 
more expensive 
The Consumer Price Index which tracks prices at the retail 
level and includes services and imports is due out Feb 26 for 
January Inflation at the consumer level was 44 percent in 1987 
The January increase left the overall Producer Price Index 
which is not seasonally adjusted at 1062 percent of its 1982 
baseperiod average 
That means that a selection of goods costing 10 in 1982 cost 
1062 last month up from 1057 in December and 1040 in January 
1987 
The government used the 1982 base for the first time in the 
January report It had used a 1967 base since 1971 A selection of 
goods that cost 10 in 1967 cost 2980 last month up from 2968 
in December and 2918 in January 1987 
The Labor Department with the January report also revised its 
seasonal adjustments for the past five years changing previously 
reported percent changes in many categories 
Michael Evans president of his own economic consulting firm in 
Washington said a modest rebound in wholesale inflation may spook 
the bond market and send longterm interest rates up 
But Lawrence Chimerine president of the Wefa Group a 
Philadelphiaarea forecasting service said the markets will be 
looking more closely at December trade deficit figures also 
released this morning 
Generally speaking inflation is still pretty mild 
Chimerine said 
Ratajczak predicts moderate wholesale inflation of 26 percent 
for 1988 and a more robust 39 percent in 1989 
The major thrust of the 1988 increase is higher farm 
prices especially for the grains and a slight increase in 
energy prices he said Our current estimates suggest 
that reacceleration of significant inflationary pressures may 
develop in 1989 as oil prices rise
