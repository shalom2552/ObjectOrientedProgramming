Vice President George Bush stumped through 
New Hampshire Monday from fast food restaurants to a retirement 
home appealing to voters to help him turn back the challenge from 
Bob Dole in Tuesdays primary 
Im going to win tomorrow he told a cheering crowd at 
Daniel Webster College Believe me 
He said in a television interview that Dole was making the same 
mistake Bush himself made in 1980 when he thought that winning the 
Iowa caucuses would give him the momentum to carry New Hampshire 
Ronald Reagan soundly defeated Bush here eight years ago after 
being upset in Iowa 
I want New Hampshire to do what it did in 1980 Bush 
said on the CBS Morning News Bob Dole is talking momentum and 
Im talking issues on taxes and holding the line on the oil import 
fee and on presidential leadership and I think its working so I 
want New Hampshire to correct Iowas mistakes 
Bushs once strong lead in New Hampshire polls has evaporated 
and polls now show the race as a virtual dead heat between the vice 
president and the Senate minority leader from Kansas 
Bush who finished third in Iowa behind Dole and Pat Robertson 
called Doles proposal for a budget freeze a copout because it 
avoids the tough decisions 
Speaking to elderly residents at a nursing home Bush called 
Doles plan a straitjacket that would limit Social Security 
costofliving increases to two percent 
Dole has said a two percent COLA cap is one possibility but he 
has also suggested exempting Social Security from a freeze 
Bush said his own leadership freeze would achieve a balanced 
budget by 1993 without touching Social Secutiy or raising taxes 
At Bushs side were large posters sitting on tripods that 
outlined the two plans in big letters 
Bushs theme all day was that he was a leader with experience 
who had been loyal to President Reagan for the last eight years 
Crowds were sparse on this Washingtons Birthday holiday morning 
as Bush informally dressed in a blue ski jacket made three 
breakfast stops 
He joined two families on a ski trip at a Bickfords Family 
Restaurant for pancakes and bacon sipped coffee with the customers 
at a Dunkin Donuts and munched an Egg McMuffin at McDonalds 
while chatting with an army sergeant 
At the retirement home Bush said I stood with our president 
through thick and thin and some suggested that hurt me in one state 
or another But you see in our family loyalty is a strength Its 
not all weakness 
On the CBS Morning News Bush said You cant live by the 
polls Ive got more delegates now than the rest of them by far 
New York Pennsylvania Michigan Whoever gets the most delegates 
will be nominated but I want to do well here
