Hillbilly goes to work each day not knowing 
whether hell face armed drug dealers snarling pit bulls or scared 
children cowering behind closed doors 
He lives in a world of danger and splitsecond decisions 
Hillbilly code name for a 37yearold Detroit narcotics 
officer is shotgun man on a crew conducting daily drug raids 
Hes a foot soldier in the citys war against crack 
Armed with a 12gauge shotgun Hillbilly is the first cop to 
enter dark crack houses and abandoned buildings Followed by a crew 
of six to eight others he secures the premises looking for guns 
and people carrying them The task takes about 30 tense seconds 
The job takes a lot more steel nerves a quick mind and plenty 
of guts 
You never get used to it he said Youre always scared 
Youd be a fool if you werent Your mind is more occupied with 
the entry You always get a lump Fear of the unknown 
Judgment is critical You have a decision to make he said 
You hope its the right one 
Hillbilly given the nickname by coworkers because of his 
Kentucky roots has been a cop for 17 years 11 in narcotics In 
that time hes seen or heard it all pit bulls guarding crack 
houses people whove used children as shields and dealers who sat 
upstairs while a hooded bound victim of an executionstyle murder 
rotted in the basement 
Their world is drugs he said Everything else is 
immaterial 
Hillbilly said a contract was put out on his life years ago He 
had 24hour guards 
Hes also had a bullet whiz through his jacket sleeve and had 
partners shot Once suspects in a house started shooting through 
the door as the cops approached The officer carrying a battering 
ram was hit Hillbilly pushed him aside He kept moving 
Hillbilly and other narcotics officers wear bulletproof vests 
under blue jumpsuits and caps The glowinthedark word police 
is emblazoned on their heads backs chests arms and shoulders 
After hundreds of raids Hillbilly says fighting drugs is 
definitely frustrating 
Youll drive yourself crazy if you think the judges are not 
putting them away he said We try not to dwell on that We 
just tend to lock that out 
He cited one recent case in which a woman and her son were 
arrested and weapons and crack were seized Weeks later police 
raided the same place he said discovering more weapons and drugs 
Whats depressing and frightening to us is they pick up the 
guns so easily he said Well probably end up there in 
another two or three weeks 
Hillbilly also has no illusions about his impact on drug 
trafficking 
Were not naive to think were stopping any major drug 
distributors in the area he said But each complaint he said 
must be pursued no matter how small 
Its nice when you get a few of the bad characters off the 
street he said Whether were helping society Well they 
have to want to help themselves 
Hillbilly said the worst part of the job is when cops are 
killed Its heartbreaking You wonder he said Is it all 
worth it For eight rocks of crack hes laying in the casket 
But he added You shake it off You go back
