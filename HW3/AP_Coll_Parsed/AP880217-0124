Many firefighters and other rescue workers deserve 
commendations for their heroic behavior during Londons worst 
subway fire the chairman of a public inquiry into the fatal blaze 
said Wednesday 
The Nov 18 fire at the Kings Cross subway station killed 31 
people 
It is apparent a number of firemen and other members of the 
emergency services behaved with exemplary conduct and displayed 
heroic behavior on the night of the disaster at Kings Cross 
said chairman Desmond Fennell 
At the end of the investigation I hope it will be possible to 
commend them individually 
Fennell did not specify what sort of commendation he anticipated 
Londons Chief Fire Officer Gerald Clarkson told the inquiry 
that officials have visited subway systems in Moscow Tokyo 
Singapore and Brussels to study their firefighting methods 
Previous testimony at the inquiry has indicated the fire was 
probably started by a lighted match dropped under a wooden 
escalator
