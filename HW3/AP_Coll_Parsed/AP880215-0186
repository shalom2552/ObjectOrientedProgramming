The government said Monday shortrange 
NATO missiles should not be upgraded now underscoring differences 
with the United States as Chancellor Helmut Kohl prepares to visit 
Washington 
Chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost also said the 
chancellor will call for an EastWest treaty banning chemical 
weapons another point of dispute between West Germany and the 
United States 
In recent weeks US officials have urged the implementation of 
a 1983 NATO decision to upgrade the shortrange nuclear weapons in 
central Europe 
US and other NATO officials say shortrange missiles gained 
added importance with the superpower agreement to scrap 
intermediaterange rockets 
The West German government says NATO must develop overall arms 
control strategies first and it insists on reductions in superior 
Soviet conventional arms before it upgrades the shortrange 
missiles 
The Federal Republic sees no need for an isolated decision on 
modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear weapon systems at 
this point Ost said Monday Such decisions should be taken 
only after new overall disarmament concepts are worked out 
The shortrange and battlefield nuclear weapons in central 
Europe have a range of less than 300 miles and thus primarily reach 
targets on West German and East German territory 
Kohl who travels to Washington on Wednesday has urged 
repeatedly that higher priority be given to reducing the overall 
number of shortrange weapons rather than upgrading particular 
systems 
Ost also said During his talks in the American capital the 
chancellor will once again press for a worldwide ban on chemical 
weapons 
US officials have said in recent months that it would be 
difficult to verify such a ban but West German officials contend 
problems can be worked out 
Verification is certainly a difficult question which needs to 
be solved but it should not lead us to question the basic 
feasibility of a chemical weapons agreement Ost said Monday
