In days of economic tension such as now bad 
news tends to land like a bomb while good news is seen as a mere 
respite not to be taken too seriously 
This explains to some degree why the recent good news hasnt 
caused any great commotion The dollar so unstable just weeks ago 
has settled down Manufacturers are expanding Exports are up The 
trade deficit has shrunk 
But will it continue Thats the question 
Today therefore was marked on calendars a long time ago as a 
day to watch it being the day on which the January US 
merchandise trade figures come out 
It could be the day on which good news makes as much noise as 
the bad Another indication that Americas trade deficit is 
improving could convince some cynics that the economy really has 
turned around 
Suggestions of that turn have been dropped bit by bit over the 
past few weeks and months but they have been falling soft as 
snowflakes rather than hard as bombs 
US manufacturing for example is out of the doldrums in which 
it had been stranded for years Production is rising output per 
manhour is up quality seems to have improved wage rates have been 
stable 
US exports have been improving The falling dollar was perhaps 
the one most important factor in the turnaround since it 
automatically made American goods less expensive abroad while 
putting pressure on imports 
But the story is more involved than that For several years 
American producers have been refining their production techniques 
refitting plants paring their payrolls and otherwise making 
themselves fit for competition 
In addition the attitude of confrontation between labor and 
management that for decades made battlegrounds of factories has to 
a very great degree evolved into one of cooperation in pursuit of 
shared goals 
In addition so gradually it has gone almost unnoticed there is 
also a greater awareness of exporting by even small companies that 
in the 1950s and 1960s were content to restrict sales to the US 
domestic market 
All this has been occurring without a great deal of bombast by 
anyone Day by day the falling dollar got most of the attention 
but the falling dollar wouldnt have been of much help to exporters 
if they werent ready to export 
The dollar got much of the attention because it posed dangers as 
well as advantages But now the dollar has stabilized at a lower 
rate the dangers inherent in its fluctuations are greatly reduced 
but the advantage remains 
Since the beginning of the year the exchange value of the 
dollar has gained 66 percent relative to the Japanese yen 84 
percent against the West German mark and 69 percent against a 
basket of 10 major foreign currencies 
Until the dollar stopped falling fears existed that foreigners 
would sour on US investments call their money home and undermine 
US stocks bonds and real estate That threat now has been 
greatly reduced 
If at the same time the United States can continue to raise 
exports and lower imports the good news probably will get the 
attention it merits while crisis headlines become the dust of 
history
