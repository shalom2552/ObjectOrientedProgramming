South Loop Elementary School opened its doors 
Monday to 335 youngsters from a rainbow of racial and economic 
backgrounds following two years of controversy over the makeup of 
its student body 
There are no more Hilliard Homes children and Dearborn Park 
children They are all South Loop children Principal Joan Fron 
declared 
The 55 million innercity school features special fine arts 
and science facilities and a staff of teachers that parents helped 
choose 
But there are problems 
Some lowincome youngsters cant attend until third grade which 
parents fear will put them at a disadvantage And there may be 
problems maintaining the required racial balance among the student 
body without overcrowding 
But Bob Saigh the city Board of Educations spokesman is 
optimistic 
They wont allow that school to fail Its being set up to 
succeed instantly in fact I think its already succeeded he 
said 
Parents from Dearborn Park and Printers Row growing 
middleclass bastions reclaiming an innercity wasteland had 
fought two years for a new school saying it had been promised when 
redevelopment changed the neighborhood Meanwhile their children 
attended classes in a modified townhouse and other schools 
But residents of the Chicago Housing Authoritys lowincome 
Hilliard Homes project angrily reminded the Chicago Board of 
Education they had been awaiting a new school for more than 20 
years 
In the end the board devised a plan that allows children from 
both areas to attend the school It calls for a student body of 540 
30 percent white and 70 percent minorities Class size is to 
remain at an average 30 students 
Classes began Monday with about 85 youngsters from Hilliard 
Homes 70 from the Dearborn Park area 45 from two middleincome 
highrises and about 135 others including 15 Hispanic children 
from around the city 
The school serves pupils from kindergarten through sixth grade 
and eventually will be expanded through the eighth grade 
As long as integration is maintained and theres no 
overcrowding were satisfied said Judy Hoch leader of Friends 
of Dearborn Park School 
But the boards plan gives preference to youngsters from 
adjoining neighborhoods That means Hilliard Homes children will 
attend nearby Haines Elementary until third grade when they can 
transfer to South Loop 
Hilliard parents say this will put their youngsters at a 
disadvantage 
We dont think we can be sure to get the same education until 
we go to the same school from kindergarten through eighth grade 
parent Jacqueline Russell said
