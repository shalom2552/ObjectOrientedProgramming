People who are able to laugh it up under 
pressure seem to have greater resistance to stressrelated ailments 
than those who dont according to a psychologist studying the link 
between humor and health 
This study points to the conclusion that humor does confer 
some health benefit when youre under stress Albert Porterfield 
assistant professor of psychology at Oberlin College said Friday 
Porterfield based his observations on preliminary results of a 
study of 140 Oberlin students who were tested to determine their 
sense of humor then completed questionnaires on incidence of such 
stressrelated maladies as headaches rashes and digestive 
problems 
There is a longrecognized relationship between the kinds of 
stress one encounters throughout life and depression and physical 
illness Porterfield said What isnt wellunderstood are the 
factors that determine how strongly daytoday stress and 
wellbeing are linked in people 
For students whose sense of humor was ranked in the top 50 
percent there was no significant link between their stress levels 
and how they felt physically he said For those on the lower half 
of the humor scale there was a positive connection between stress 
and illness 
The results were similar when the same students were tested a 
year later Porterfield said The connection between humor and 
resistance to stressrelated illnesses seems to show a marked 
increase for those above the 60th percentile in the humor rating 
he said 
The humor rankings were based on two tests one presents 
subjects with hypothetical situations and asks them how they would 
respond the other deals with subjects use of humor in times of 
stress
