Chrysler Corp Chariman Lee Iacocca says his 
company will establish an estimated 20 million trust fund to help 
the 5500 autoworkers at its Kenosha plant meet housing education 
and other needs after they lose their jobs when the factory closes 
Gov Tommy G Thompson who has threatened to sue Chrysler over 
the plant closing called the announcement a good first step 
but that the automaker must do more to avoid the possibility of 
ending up in court 
Leaders and members of United Autoworkers Union Local 72 which 
represents 5000 hourly workers at Kenosha were less enthusiastic 
About 80 union members set up a picket line outside the hotel 
where Iacocca held a news conference to announce the trust fund 
the money for which would come from Chryslers profits on all its 
cars sold in Wisconsin this year 
Iacocca said based on 1987 sales the ChryslerKenosha Trust 
Fund should grow to about 20 million by the end of the year It 
would be administered by a sevenmember board of trustees appointed 
by state and local officials and by Chrysler and its dealer 
organizations 
We are not interested in a charity program that is financed 
only if Chrysler cars are sold said Rudy Kuzel bargaining 
chairman for Local 72 We want jobs He could have said I will 
keep my word and keep the plant open 
Kuzel also said the offer of a 20 million trust fund was too 
little 
Our attorneys tell us the damages in this case are 1 
billion Kuzel said adding that figure includes the plants 
total payroll for five years 
But leaders of the national UAW were warmer in their reaction 
Chrysler should be commended for showing a degree of 
responsiveness in this painful situation the UAW said in a 
statement released in Detroit 
Iacocca said the trust fund would be in addition to 
approximately 13 million that the company will give governments 
to repay for capital improvements such as roads It would also be 
in addition to benefits guaranteed workers in the contract between 
Chrysler and the UAW and benefits negotiated by the union in a 
plant closing agreement Iacocca said 
Iacocca stressed however there was no way he would change his 
mind about closing the Kenosha carmaking plant which is scheduled 
to shut down this summer Chrysler will still employ about 1000 
people in Kenosha at an engine plant 
The decision to close Kenosha was a crummy call but one we had 
to make Time and the marketplace just caught up with an 86year 
old plant Iacocca said 
Iacocca also said the companys decision to close the plant did 
not break any contracts with the state regarding the future of the 
former American Motors Corp facility 
We are guilty as hell of being cockeyed optimists and we are 
paying the price for the optimism right now Iacocca said 
Iacocca said the company had hoped to continue building cars in 
Kenosha for threetofive years but car sales were not good enough 
to allow that 
What we did unintentionally was to create expectations that 
couldnt be fulfilled Iacocca said 
Iacocca said the decision to establish the trust fund should not 
be viewed as a precedent for other auto plant closings 
He said Kenosha was a unique situation because of the impact the 
closing will have on a relatively small city Kenoshas population 
is about 75000 
Iacocca also said Thompsons threats to file a lawsuit against 
the nations third largest automaker were not a factor in setting 
up the trust fund 
Iacocca said he Thompson and House Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Les Aspin DWis would meet in Washington on Thursday 
He said he hoped an agreement would be reached eventually that 
would avoid the need for the state and Chrysler to meet in the 
courtroom
