Prices shot above official levels 
Wednesday as the Nicaraguan government implemented a plan to 
replace its old currency with new notes 
Prices for eggs cooking oil and soft drinks tripled 
At least 40 Nicarguans were arrested for currency violations and 
police said several US Embassy employees were caught illegally 
exchanging currency 
Commander Doris Tijerino the citys police chief said none of 
the embassy employees were arrested 
The program which went into effect Monday replaced the old 
cordoba currency with new cordoba notes pegged at a higher value to 
the US dollar Nicaraguans had three days to exchange their old 
cordoba bills for new ones 
The government closed the period for trading old bills 
Wednesday claiming enough new bills were in circulation 
Commander Rene Vivas deputy interior minister told the 
Sandinista newspaper Barricada that the government had discovered a 
Contra plan to introduce large quantities of old cordobas into the 
country 
He said border customs houses were closed Monday to stop the 
alleged plan 
The cordoba is worth 1000 times more than the old currency The 
new cordoba is worth about 10 US cents 
The Sandinista government also authorized price increases of up 
to 500 percent for a list of 33 basic staples and raised salaries 
up to five times above their December levels 
The government said it sought to curb inflation which reached 
1500 percent in 1987 
But prices for many basic goods suddenly jumped beyond their 
official levels this week even at government sales booths that 
ration the commodities 
A carton of 30 eggs that went for the equivalent of 15 new 
cordobas last week rose to 50 cordobas at the government booths 
and fetched 60 in the black market Meat prices also shot up 
A liter about a quart of cooking oil that sold for 37 
cordobas in the government booths last week rose to 12 this week 
In the black market the price per liter went from 100 to 150 
cordobas 
Thousands of people were angered with the new prices according 
to a new radio channel the government set up last weekend to 
explain the reforms 
One resident of the Villa Libertad district in the east of 
Managua complained that a tiny corn tortilla smaller than a 
hand now costs a full cordoba double what it did before the 
currency swap 
Soft drinks that used to cost 3 cordobas now cost 15 even 
though the governments fixed price was ten he complained 
Newspapers also raised their prices The opposition daily La 
Prensa which formerly cost the equivalent of two new cordobas 
sold for ten Wednesday Barricada the government daily sold for 
five cordobas up from one last week Nicaraguans were only allowed 
to cash in 10 million cordobas Those arrested for currency 
violations face up to six months in prison 
Tijerino the police chief said various vehicles from the 
American Embassy were surprised giving personnel at an exchange 
house packets that supposedly contained money 
He said the law mandates all foreign embassy personnel change 
their old currency at the Foreign Ministry 
It was not clear whether the embassy employees were Americans
