The meeting between President Reagan and 
President Miguel de la Madrid showed that despite differences on 
foreign policy trade and narcotics trafficking USMexican 
relations are improving 
The new atmosphere is due in large part to what one US 
official called the excellent personal working relationship 
between the two leaders who have met six times over the past five 
years 
On the basis of personal friendship we have reviewed 
matters of interest overcoming delicate matters de la Madrid 
said in welcoming Reagan to this Pacific coastal resort Saturday 
The two chief executives accompanied by highranking officials 
of their administrations met for four hours Saturday to discuss 
issues of common concern including trade narcotics trafficking 
and Central American policy 
It was the last officially scheduled meeting between the two 
presidents De la Madrid ends his sixyear term on Nov 30 and 
Reagan leaves his post in January 
Unlike some of his predecessors de la Madrid has avoided open 
confrontations with the US government over foreign policy 
Instead he tends to stress the positive 
De la Madrid has been a tempering influence among Latin American 
leaders under domestic pressure to declare moratoriums on their 
enormous foreign debts much of which is owed to American banks 
In turn the US government has been instrumental in getting 
US banks to agree to refinance portions of Mexicos enormous 
foreign debt of 105 billion and to lend this country the money it 
badly needs for development 
Mexico has drawn praise from the United States for drastically 
lowering its trade barriers and the United States has responded by 
opening up the US market to Mexican textiles leather goods and 
other products 
De la Madrid has strongly pushed the marketopening moves as a 
way to help modernize the sickly Mexican economy and pull it out of 
its lengthy economic crisis 
A perennial source of irritation had been the US attitude that 
Mexico was not doing its best in the fight against illegal drug 
trafficking because of official corruption 
But the Mexicans now have practically forced the United States 
to admit that there is corruption on both sides of the Rio Grande 
and that the drug fight must be a joint effort 
Mexico is a large producer of marijuana and heroin for the US 
market and a relay point for South American cocaine 
Secretary of State George P Shultz stressed the importance of 
the antinarcotics campaign saying Colombia was an example of a 
situation where drug traffickers can become a powerful and 
disruptive factor in a society 
Colombias attorney general was assassinated recently by drug 
dealers responsible for the deaths of numerous judges and other 
government officials 
Highranking Mexican officials have privately expressed the fear 
that Mexico could become another Colombia 
But Shultz and Attorney General Edwin Meese avoided any 
references to official Mexican corruption a charge often made in 
the past by US officials at lower levels 
Mexico is waiting for the US Congress to ratify the new Mutual 
Legal Assistance Pact that would enable police agencies in both 
countries to exchange information to track down drug criminals on 
both sides of the border 
Problems remain between the countries but it is an indication 
of the new relationship that the two neighbors can talk about them 
without sounding like a debate 
Reagan openly spoke of his support for the Nicaraguan Contra 
rebels who are funded by the United States That is a sore topic 
for Mexico which backs a political not a military solution to 
the conflict in Nicaragua 
De la Madrid also urged the United States to eliminate any 
further barriers to exports from Mexico and said US immigration 
laws must take into account the rights of Mexican migrant workers 
In the past five years we have demonstrated that we can 
cooperate to achieve creative mutually beneficial solutions 
Reagan told de la Madrid This is a valuable legacy that we leave 
to our successors
