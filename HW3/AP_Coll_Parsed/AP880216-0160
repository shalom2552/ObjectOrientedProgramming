A permit that would have allowed Japanese 
salmon fishermen to accidentally catch seals killer whales and 
other mammals violated an animalprotection law a federal appeals 
court ruled Tuesday 
The US Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld a preliminary 
injunction issued by a federal district judge last June that halted 
gillnet fishing for salmon by Japanese fleets in the Bering Sea off 
Alaska 
In a 21 decision a threejudge panel rejected an appeal by the 
Federation of Japan Fisheries Cooperative Association to overturn 
the preliminary injunction issued by US District Judge Norma 
Holloway Johnson 
The injunction was obtained by an environmental group and a 
native Alaskan fishermans organization to stop the accidental 
taking of sea lions fur seals white porpoises and killer whales 
that could be ensnared in the ninemilelong gillnets 
As issued by the secretary of commerce the threeyear permit 
would have allowed the Japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5250 
Dalls porpoises in the northern Pacific Ocean including 789 in 
the Bering Sea 
The court ruled that the permit which allowed the Japanese 
fishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took 
violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
The interest in maintaining healthy populations of marine 
mammals comes first and the secretary cannot ignore the fur seals 
He can include the northern fur seals in the permit only if he 
makes the requisite findings the court said in an opinion by 
Judge Gerhard Gesell 
Lacking such findings the permit cannot issue Moreover he 
may not allow the federation merely to pay the price for taking 
protected marine mammals and he must face up the taking of other 
marime mammals the record shows will inevitably occur if gillnet 
fishing is permitted Gesell said in the opinion joined by Judge 
Ruth B Ginsburg 
Judge Kenneth Starr filed a dissent saying the majority 
decision is unsupported by the text structure or legislative 
history of the statute 
The injunction was obtained by the Center for Environmental 
Education and the Kokechik Fishermens Association
