With drug abuse blamed for 20 percent of AIDS 
cases in Western Europe several countries are exploring ways to 
get clean needles to addicts to slow the spread of the disease 
The goal is to help addicts stop sharing needles and cut their 
risk of passing AIDS to each other and to the general population 
The World Health Organization is encouraging national campaigns to 
reduce needlesharing as part of its global strategy to combat AIDS 
The Netherlands Britain and Switzerland have introduced 
extensive needle exchange programs 
Elsewhere health authorities are using other approaches to make 
syringes and needles more widely available to keep addicts from 
sharing equipment 
In Copenhagen Denmark for example addicts or anyone else 
can now pick up free syringes and needles at drugstores After 
closing hours they can buy a syringe and two needles for the 
equivalent of 80 cents from sidewalk dispensing machines 
Although male homosexuals have been most at risk from AIDS drug 
abusers now account for 20 percent of cases reported to the World 
Health Organization in Geneva from Western Europe and 25 percent 
from the United States 
Dr Manuel Carballo chief of social and behavioral research for 
the organizations Global Program on AIDS said in an interview 
that there is also evidence that drugtaking by injection is 
increasing 
If AIDS is introduced into the general population of Western 
countries on a large scale Carballo said it will probably be 
because of drug abuse through sexual contact with infected 
addicts including prostitutes and from pregnant women to their 
babies 
In January AIDS experts from 23 countries met at the World 
Health Organizations headquarters to review ways of dealing with 
the rise in AIDS among intravenous drug abusers 
Among proposals they considered were giving addicts bleach to 
clean needles providing washing facilities in drug clinics 
information campaigns and needleexchange programs 
Carballo said the main objection to exchange programs was that 
they could be seen to condone the use of drugs 
Under such programs addicts receive free syringes and needles 
in exchange for their used ones At the same time health 
authorities offer advice on AIDS and drug treatment 
Even though the World Health Organization has not publicly 
endorsed needle exchange Carballo said he favors the idea when 
combined with efforts to reduce drugtaking 
If we accept that needlesharing is one of the primary routes 
of HIV infection then it stands to reason that the longterm 
effect of these programs may well be the cutting down the potential 
spread of HIV the health official said 
HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS 
Intravenous drug users sometimes share needles not only because 
of short supplies but also as a social gesture in the way 
marijuana users pass joints 
Carballo said evidence from the Netherlands and Britain 
indicates that exchange programs can reduce needlesharing 
although there is no evidence yet of a reduction in AIDS infection 
The Dutch program began in 1984 and is by far the most extensive 
in the world It is centered in Amsterdam the capital which is a 
haven for drug abusers with an estimated 7000 addicts 
Municipal spokesman Gijs van Stijgeren said the city distributes 
600000 needles a year No questions are asked and no names taken 
The spokesman said a small proportion of the nations 400 AIDS 
patients are drug abusers adding that the Amsterdam program 
doubtlessly has been of great influence in slowing the rate of 
infection Another contributing factor however could be that many 
heroin addicts in the city prefer smoking the drug to injecting it 
The British program began last April as a oneyear experiment 
with the establishment of 15 needleexchange clinics in England and 
Scotland Results have been uneven 
The program has recruited about 2000 addicts nationwide and 
some larger clinics such as the three in London are seeing as 
many as 50 people a day officials say 
But a program set up in Dundee Scotland collapsed after six 
weeks in what was described as an atmosphere of acrimony between 
health workers and their clients One addict in a fit of anger 
reportedly sprayed blood from a syringe on a worker 
In Glasgow Scotland local residents picketed the clinic for 
six months maintaining that it would attract junkies and pushers 
into their neighborhood The protests have since died out and 
officials say the program is going smoothly 
Much attention has been focused on Edinburgh the Scottish 
capital which has a notorious problem with hard drugs 
Unlike England where drug abuse accounts for 1 percent of all 
reported AIDS cases 60 percent of AIDS carriers in Scotland are 
intravenous drug users and the majority of them live in Edinburgh 
Carol Tinto administrator of the Lothian Health Boards AIDS 
Prevention Team which is in charge of Edinburghs program said it 
has been a qualified success 
Tinto said the clinic has had 115 clients including 50 or so 
regulars but it has not been able to recruit large numbers because 
it was set up to be open one afternoon a week and distribute only 
three needles at a time to each addict 
The Monitoring Research Group at the University of Londons 
Goldsmiths College has produced a confidential report on the 
British program and the government will not disclose its findings 
until the report is studied 
Dr Gerry Stimson a sociologist who led the research would not 
discuss the groups overall assessment but said some of the larger 
clinics have been very successful in attracting new clients 
Major cities in Switzerland launched anonymous needleexchange 
programs one year ago In Zurich a European harddrug center with 
an estimated 4000 addicts syringes and needles are available free 
and without prescription from doctors and drugstores Public 
reaction to the program has been mild
