New Jersey Rep Christopher Smith stamped 
his foot on the airport tarmac trying to get back the circulation 
in his big toe Such is the glamor of the campaign trail 
Smith along with more than a dozen other congressmen became a 
potential frostbite victim en route to campaigning for Rep Jack 
Kemp a colleague and fellow conservative Republican whos running 
for president 
Arriving from Washington aboard two cramped chartered planes 
Smith and his fellow travelers were unexpectedly warmed by the 
30degree air around this state capitol 
Thirty felt good compared with the interiors of the planes 
neither of which had working heaters For the twohour flight the 
congressmen kept their coats on and buried themselves under the 
days New York Times 
They came here for a media hit a show of solidarity for 
Kemp on the statehouse steps The idea was to give the campaign a 
highprofile booster shot less than a week before the states 
critical firstinthenation primary election 
The idea also was to be pictured with Kemp in front of the 
forest of television cameras that has sprouted up in the small town 
square 
The busy congressmen who logged a total of four hours up and 
back in the frigid skies spent about 20 minutes campaigning They 
waved flags and shouted Jack is back as Kemp predicted victory 
to what at least last week was likely the largest press corps in 
any 30000person town in the world 
Smith who has worked nearly a year on Kemps behalf saw his 
brief afternoon in New Hampshire as time well spent 
Like other Kemp backers Smith says hes encouraged by the 
momentum his candidate has shown here Once an also ran the 
Buffalo NY congressman claims to be creeping into a position 
just behind GOP frontrunners Vice President George Bush and Sen 
Bob Dole of Kansas 
Kemp claimed a boost in the Iowa precinct cacuses on Feb 8 
when Republicans handed Bush an unexpected and unsettling third 
place Dole ran first followed by former TV evangelist Pat 
Robertson Kemp was fourth 
Its a new day Its a new race he triumphantly told his 
audience composed of friends and reporters and hardly anyone 
else 
Its easier around here these days for wouldbe presidents to 
get the attention of a 150000ayear television reporter than to 
attract real live local residents 
But then unlike on most Main Streets presidential campaign 
offices here are more common than convenience stores As Kemp gave 
his speech outside the statehouse Dole was shaking hands inside 
Bush was expected later 
Watching Kemps congressmen a full 3 percent of the US House 
of Representatives disembark from buses a truck driver sighed 
Here they come again 
Such political nonchalance reminded Smith of his trip to Iowa 
for Kemp the weekend before Smith said he thought Iowans would at 
least be startled when a congressman from New Jersey knocked at 
their door 
But he quickly found its hard to impress anybody whos had 
pancakes with the vice president
