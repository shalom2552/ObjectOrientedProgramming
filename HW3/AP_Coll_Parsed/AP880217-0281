Construction contracts will drop 4 percent this 
year led by steep declines in office and other commercial building 
and lesser drops in housing and public works projects according to 
a forecast released Wednesday 
Builders will commit to 2462 billion worth of new contracts in 
all of 1988 compared with 2552 billion last year according to an 
update of the 1988 DodgeSweets Construction Outlook put out by 
McGrawHill Information Systems Co 
In coming months construction activity will only be slightly 
affected by the stock market crash of last October the McGrawHill 
unit said 
Since October consumer confidence has been shaken federal 
budgetary restraint has been tightened and expectations for the 
economys growth in 1988 have been lowered said George A 
Christie chief economist at the company At the same time 
however the outlook for interest rates has brightened 
Accordingly so long as a recession is avoided this mix of 
positive and negative developments will not pose a serious threat 
to a creditsensitive industry such as construction he said 
Christie predicted nonresidential building would drop 7 percent 
to 895 billion this year led by the highly overbuilt office 
market 
Office building activity should drop by 14 percent to 192 
billion and will have to fall even more if the office vacancy 
rate is to shrink from its current 20plus percent he added 
Reduced consumer spending and weaker homebuilding together 
could mean a 12 percent drop in the retail sector to 216 
billion while industrial building should pick up by 6 percent 
Christie said 
While many wouldbe home buyers remain on the sidelines in the 
wake of the market crash lower interest rates will lure others 
back into the market he said 
Even so single family homebuilding will ease 1 percent to 
849 billion and multifamily housing will slump 4 percent to 
263 billion dragged down by a large surplus of apartments he 
added 
The report predicted nonbuilding construction would be pulled 
two ways in 1988 with environmental building increasing by 2 
percent and transportation building down by 4 percent 
As a result total nonbuilding construction will shrink by 1 
percent overall to 451 billion the forecast said
