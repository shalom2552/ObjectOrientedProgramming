A senior Justice Department official says the 
Reagan administration might have avoided its IranContra mistakes 
if it had the political nerve to stand by its plan to curb leaks 
with widespread polygraph tests and expanded censorship 
The administration paid a real price for backing off 
President Reagans antileak order in 1984 said Assistant Attorney 
General Richard K Willard architect of the plan known as National 
Security Decision Directive 84 
That price showed up most clearly in IranContra people were 
so afraid of leaks from official channels that they bypassed those 
safeguards They adopted all these other approaches that resulted 
in inadequate consideration and scrutiny Willard said in an 
interview before he leaves government this week for private 
practice 
Presidential and congressional investigations said the fear of 
leaks was a prime motive for White House aides to rely on shadowy 
businessmen to carry out Iran and Contra policies while keeping key 
Reagan Cabinet members in the dark 
Willard believes if these people had been consulted they would 
have prevented the mistakes 
Although Willard became a symbol of government secrecy during 
the antileak fight the 39yearold lawyer operated quite openly 
during seven years at the Justice Department whether he was 
devising changes in intelligence policy or planning drug tests for 
federal employees 
Looking back he said the administrations biggest victories 
such as raising public concern about drugs and adding new drug 
agents and drug tests show the importance of altering public 
opinion before changing government policy 
And its biggest disappointments including onandoff support 
for Contra rebels in Nicaragua reveal the folly of trying to sneak 
new policies through the Washington political thicket Willard said 
Willard who served at Justice longer than any other Reagan 
appointee now heads its civil division But he started as 
intelligence policy counsel to Attorney General William French 
Smith who named him to head the interagency team that drafted the 
antileak order 
That order would have subjected the hundreds of thousands of 
federal employees who see classified papers to possible firing if 
they refused to take polygraph tests in leak investigations Other 
thousands with access to the deepest secrets would have to let the 
government censor their speeches and writings for life 
The order enraged editorial writers many members of Congress 
authors and publishers public employee unions civil liberties 
groups and privately even some of Willards colleagues at 
Justice 
Willard became the directives only public defender and was as 
he put it castigated daily in the columns of The New York Times 
and The Washington Post for most of a year The pressure forced 
Reagan to replace the order with a small polygraph test program in 
the Pentagon 
The administration showed a lack of political nerve to deal 
with this problem because they were afraid to take on the press 
which paid more attention than the order deserved Willard said 
This administration has had its greatest problems where we 
just try to change public policy without changing the overall 
climate of ideas in the country Willard said You have real 
problems given the balance of power in Washington between the 
president and Congress and entrenched interest groups 
No one thought then that the leak order would solve all the 
problems or even most of them it was part of an effort to get a 
better climate of ideas about leaks Willard said But people 
like Bill Casey then CIA director and others who should have had 
an equally strong interest did not think it was important to defend 
and deal with the public 
Willard said President Jimmy Carter had the same problem with 
his failed military mission to rescue US hostages in Iran 
People who could have helped make the project a success were not 
brought into it because of the fear of leaks 
I feel the same way about Central America Willard said 
It was a mistake early in this administration to do so much 
covert action without developing public support 
Among administration successes Willard said the whole drug 
issue not just drug testing but the broader change of attitudes 
about drugs in this country is a remarkable turnabout since the 
Carter administration when some localities dropped criminal 
penalties for minor drug use 
And he cited his own 3yearold effort to reduce soaring damage 
awards in liability cases Our strategy was to emphasize the need 
for reform across the board rather than say We need this federal 
statute and all our problems will be solved 
Federal revisions still have not passed but after many 
speeches and sending reports to every state legislator in 1986 
and 1987 47 of the 50 states adopted one or more of our 
recommendations to limit liability he said 
Willard said if he had one thing to do over I would have tried 
to get the senior national security and intelligence people to 
undertake more of a personal commitment to the leak policy before 
committing so much of my own effort and reputation 
After that battle Attorney General Smiths deputy Edward 
Schmults volunteered to a newsman that Willard wont be nominated 
to head the civil division or any post requiring Senate 
confirmation so long as Smith and I are here He wasnt nominated 
until Edwin Meese became attorney general
