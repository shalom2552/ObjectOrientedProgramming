The government plans to enact into permanent law 
an antiterrorism measure it introduced to counter the IRA 
allowing police to hold people without charge for a week news 
reports said today 
The reports come at a time of worsening of AngloIrish 
relations Recently Dublin suspended the processing of extradition 
warrants from Britain 
The British Broadcasting Corp the Times of London and other 
newspapers said Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers government plans 
to enact the Prevention of Terrorism Act instead of having 
Parliament renew it annually 
The act would apply to all of Britain To make it permanent 
Mrs Thatcher must submit it to Parliament for approval 
The Home Office refused to confirm the reports but said in a 
statement that Home Secretary Douglas Hurd is likely to be making 
an announcement on the matter The Times said the announcement 
would come today 
Dublin has criticized the act so its permanent enactment is 
thought likely to worsen AngloIrish relations which deteriorated 
sharply last month over Britains refusal to prosecute police who 
allegedly killed six unarmed Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland in 
1982 
The act intended as a temporary measure when first introduced 
in 1974 as a means to help combat the Irish Republican Army is now 
also used against international terrorism in general 
It allows police to hold people without charge for up to seven 
days without having to inform anyone or bring them before a court 
The Irish government of Prime Minister Charles Haughey alleges 
that British police have used the act to harass Irish people and 
gather information on the Irish community in general 
In some cases Irish government ministers have been held at 
British airports under the act leading to diplomatic complaints 
Critics say more than 1 million people have been detained under 
the act at one time or another but that less than 200 were 
subsequently convicted of any offense British government figures 
show that of 225 people held under the act last year only 27 were 
subsequently charged with an offense 
But Mrs Thatchers government says the act has played a major 
role in fighting terrorism The government said the act allowed 
police in June 1985 to prevent an IRA bombing campaign in mainland 
British resorts 
The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the British from 
Northern Ireland It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant 
province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under 
socialist rule 
Haughey said after meeting Mrs Thatcher at the European 
Economic Community summit in Brussels on Friday that relations 
between the two governments were at an impasse 
It was the first meeting between the leaders since the London 
government on Jan 25 acknowledged there was evidence of a 
conspiracy to obstruct justice following the killing of six unarmed 
Catholics by police in three separate incidents in Northern Ireland 
in 1982 Irish anger was sparked by Britains announcement that it 
would not prosecute the officers allegedly involved 
Dublin meanwhile has suspended processing British extradition 
warrants for suspects wanted in Northern Ireland and the British 
mainland the Irish Times reported Monday It said the Dublin 
government had accused British authorities of failing to comply 
with terms of a new extradition law the Irish Parliament passed 
Dec 10 
The terms include a requirement that supporting evidence should 
accompany requests for extradition and Attorney General Sir 
Patrick Mayhew of Britain has refused to do so 
Irish press reports said that as a result Irish law officers 
have since taken no action on at least five British extradition 
warrants none of which concerned terrorist cases
