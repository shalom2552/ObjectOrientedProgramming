Two US Navy warships under orders to assert 
international navigation rights were deliberately bumped by two 
Soviet warships on Friday after moving within 12 miles of Russias 
Black Sea coastline the Pentagon said 
No one was injured and damage to the two ships was described as 
light 
But the administration immediately lodged a strong protest with 
the Soviet ambassador here saying the vessels had done nothing 
provocative and were operating in accord with international law 
As Secretary of State George P Shultz said just a week ago 
we are prepared to deal with the best and worst of Soviet 
behavior said Rudolph Boone a State Department spokesman 
We intend to continue exercising our rights under 
international law The Soviets are obligated to comply with their 
international commitments 
Navy officials said during a Pentagon briefing there was no 
question that the cruiser USS Yorktown and destroyer USS Caron had 
been struck deliberately by a Soviet frigate and a smaller coastal 
patrol boat respectively 
The Soviet warships broadcast a warning beforehand saying they 
were authorized to strike your ship with one of ours said 
Capt Gerry Flynn a top aide to the chief of naval operations 
The two Soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on the 
American vessels which were as we would say in the Navy 
shouldered out of the way Flynn added 
The Yorktown and Caron maintained their course and speed despite 
the bumping eventually steaming farther from the Soviet coast 
Flynn said 
The latest report I have now is that both ships are operating 
routinely in the Black Sea as planned he said 
Flynn and other Pentagon officials said they could not recall a 
similar incident of deliberate bumping during operations in the 
Black Sea The Soviets strongly protested a similar deployment by 
the same two ships in March 1986 but did nothing at the time to 
physically interfere with their passage 
The Soviet Union claimed Friday the US Navy ships violated its 
border ignored warnings and dangerously maneuvered in Soviet 
territorial waters 
It was a routine passage and we were doing nothing provocative 
at all Flynn countered We view this with considerable 
concern 
According to Cmdr Richard Schiff a Navy lawyer who appeared 
with Flynn the Yorktown and Caron were operating off the Crimean 
peninsula in what the Navy calls its assertion of rights 
program an effort to periodically steam through contested waters 
to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas 
Unlike the United States which claims a threemile territorial 
limit the Soviet Union claims a 12mile limit along its coast 
Schiff explained The United States will accept such a claim but 
any country claiming 12 miles must allow for innocent passage by 
the ships of all nations he said 
The Soviet Union tries to insist that foreign ships stick to 
specified sea lanes when making an innocent passage something it 
has no right to do the lawyer said 
So what our ships were doing there was exercising that right 
of innocent passage Schiff said He noted that Soviet 
intelligencegathering ships routinely operate within five miles of 
the US coastline 
According to the Pentagon Fridays incident began with the 
Yorktown and Caron steaming eastward parallel to each other and 
about three miles apart past the Crimean peninsula The Caron was 
about seven miles off the shoreline and the Yorktown about 10 
The two ships had been shadowed by three Soviet vessels and 
Soviet reconnaissance aircraft ever since entering the Black Sea 
through the Turkish Straits on Wednesday 
At about 11 am local time Friday or 3 am EST Flynn said 
the Soviets broadcast the following warning to the US ships 
Soviet ships have orders to prevent violation of territorial 
waters I am authorized to strike your ship with one of ours 
The Caron responded I am engaged in innocent passage 
consistent with international law 
When neither the Caron or Yorktown changed course a 
Krivakclass frigate moved up on the Yorktown and a Mirkaclass 
patrol vessel moved on the Caron grazing the left sides of the 
each Flynn said 
American naval forays into the Black Sea each of which must be 
approved by the president are normally ordered at least once a 
year for two reasons said Pentagon officials who asked not to be 
named 
The Navy ships are expected to monitor Soviet military 
operations frequently employing electronic listening gear and to 
assert the right of US warships to navigate through those waters 
The Soviet Union considers the Black Sea as its own lake 
even though it is only one of several nations bordering the seas 
waters and maintains a large naval fleet there 
According to Boone Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost 
called in Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin Friday morning to lodge 
a strong protest 
Defense Secretary Frank C Carlucci who is scheduled to meet 
with his Soviet counterpart next month also intends to protest the 
Russian action Boone said
