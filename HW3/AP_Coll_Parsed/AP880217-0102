Democrat Richard Gephardt cheered by 
his secondplace showing in New Hampshires primary said today 
that voters will buy his ideas because this is not a candidacy 
this is a cause 
Gephardt continued his campaign theme of change as he left New 
Hampshire for South Dakota which holds a primary next Tuesday 
This is not a candidacy this is a cause And the cause is 
changing America a new trade policy a new agriculture and energy 
policy inspiring and motivating our corporate leaders to stop the 
paper profits and to start looking at how we do the business of 
America again to make good products he told CBS This 
Morning 
Gephardt said his showing in the New Hampshire Democratic 
presidential primary leaves him positioned to do great in the 
South 
It appears to me that weve got a DukakisGephardt race 
through the rest of the country Gephardt said Tuesday night 
Final but unofficial results gave Massachusetts Gov Michael 
Dukakis 37 percent Gephardt the congressman from Missouri 20 
percent and Sen Paul Simon of Illinois 18 percent 
At his campaign headquarters in Manchester Gephardt began a 
jubilant victory statement by saying I love New Hampshire 
Everybody said the Gephardt campaign couldnt do it in New 
Hampshire he told cheering supporters 
Well we said that this is one nation one people and we 
proved that the people of New Hampshire are a part of this country 
and care about this country and about this cause 
Gephardt insisted that his campaigns finances were in good 
shape for the move south He said loans to the campaign were made 
against federal matching funds which he will receive later 
Its a cashflow situation he said We didnt borrow 
money that we didnt have coming So were in good shape Were 
going to do fine for Super Tuesday 
Gephardt pointed to a recent USA Today poll that put him first 
in the South in front of Dukakis Simon Al Gore and Jesse Jackson 
Asked whether Simons thirdplace showing would put him out of 
the race Gephardt said he didnt know 
Paul has run a good campaign hes a fine man and thats his 
decision he said 
Simon and Gephardt had been concentrating their fire on each 
other until the weekend when both switched to advertisements 
attacking Dukakis 
Jim Demers cochairman of Gephardts New Hampshire campaign 
noted that Dukakis now has a gold medal and a bronze after 
his thirdplace Iowa showing and Tuesdays victory Gephardt picked 
up the metaphor later saying Ive got a gold and a silver 
Gephardt said he was especially happy to have won in Manchester 
which is the states largest city There he beat Dukakis 29 percent 
to 27 percent 
Gephardt planned to leave the state early this morning for South 
Dakota where he will spend six of the seven days before the 
states primary Feb 23
