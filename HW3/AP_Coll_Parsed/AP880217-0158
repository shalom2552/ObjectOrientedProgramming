More than 800 telephone calls and letters 
from National Rifle Association members have flooded a New York 
county executives office opposing the candidacy of Police Chief 
Tony Bouza for a post there 
Bouza is one of four finalists for police commissioner in 
Suffolk County NY east of New York City on Long Island 
He has been a outspoken critic of the NRA and its stand on gun 
control and is a leading critic of a proposed 
righttobeararms amendment to the Minnesota Constitution 
which is supported by the NRA 
We have no feeling one way or the other as far as the other 
candidates are concerned said Dick Sorrentino an NRA field 
representative for New York and New Jersey Suffolk County has 
problems to begin with as far as pistol licensing goes Its very 
restrictive We certainly dont need someone with Bouzas 
feelings on gun ownership in charge of pistol licensing 
Bouzas made his stand very publicly and we couldnt ignore 
it Sorrentino said We had to make our feelings known 
Other finalists are Anthony Voelker a 35year veteran on the 
New York City Police Department Daniel Guido chief of police in 
Stamford Conn and Martin OConnor chief of Long Islands Nassau 
County police support division 
The NRA has more than 25000 members in Suffolk County But Brad 
OHearn a spokesman for Suffolk County Executive Patrick Halpin 
said the NRAs telephone and letterwriting campaign is unlikely to 
influence Halpins decision on a new police commissioner That 
decision is expected next week 
Bouzas third term as Minneapolis police chief expires at the 
end of the year
