Industrialist Victor Posner must design a 3 
million project to aid the homeless and work in a downtown shelter 
for vagrants as part of an unusual sentence for tax evasion 
US District Judge Eugene P Spellman told the 69yearold 
tycoon Friday that he would have served some of the maximum 40year 
prison term he had faced had Posner not offered to make a large 
contribution of time and money instead 
Posner whose worth is estimated at more than 240 million 
pleaded no contest Sept 29 to evading more than 12 million in 
federal taxes by inflating the value of land he donated to a Bible 
college as a tax exemption 
If I didnt have the alternative youve given me Mr Posner 
then I would turn to the only alternative the law gives me 
Spellman said That is incarceration 
At your age I doubt youd be in jail more than six to nine 
months regardless of the sentence he said 
Spellman also warned Posner Not one dollar of the funds of 
this project are taxdeductible 
The sentence also includes five years probation 5000 hours of 
community service 4 million in back taxes penalties and interest 
and a 75000 fine 
Posner must spend six months with a committee of experts 
studying the plight of the homeless in South Florida design 
solutions and then pay a minimum of 3 million to implement them 
His sentence begins immediately spending five hours a week for the 
next 60 days at the Camillus House shelter for the homeless 
Posner fended off questions after the hearing but responded when 
asked if the sentencing plan was his idea 
Ive been involved in charitable work all my life and I give 
millions and millions to charity he said 
Prosecutors had asked Spellman to give him jail time arguing it 
would be a deterrent to tax evasion 
But Monsignor Bryan Walsh a member of the committee and head of 
the charity organization of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of 
Miami said the sentence could be a great help to the homeless 
There is so little help for the homeless in South Florida 
he said noting the city has no permanent public shelters for them 
Posner was indicted in 1982 on charges of filing false returns 
between 1975 and 1979 and of evading taxes by inflating the value 
of property he donated to Miami Christian College 
Miami real estate broker William Scharrer Sr was charged with 
aiding and abetting in the tax violations He was convicted in 1984 
and sentenced to 18 months 
Posners holdings include controlling interests in Royal Crown 
Cola Sharon Steel Corp Arbys and the Graniteville textile 
company He was named Americas highestpaid executive by Business 
Week magazine in 1985 
The secretive industrialist who rarely grants public interview 
reportedly earned 86 million in 1986 
Posner a high school dropout and son of a Russian immigrant 
has sold off holdings in recent years to pay company debts 
His Evans Products Co and Sharon Steel have filed for 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law
