State and federal officials are fighting 
efforts by Texas and California to keep out Florida citrus fruit 
after the lifting of a federal ban imposed to keep a plant disease 
from spreading to other states 
The issue is canker a bacterial disease with the potential to 
seriously cripple an entire industry 
Florida has been battling a mild form of nursery canker for 
three years Industry leaders and scientists recently succeeded in 
convincing the US Department of Agriculture it was not a threat 
to fruit or trees in commercial groves Officials had initially 
feared the disease was the virulent Asiatic canker 
After months of state and federal research and deliberation the 
USDA last week lifted its 3yearold ban prohibiting shipments of 
Florida fresh fruit to other citrusgrowing states 
Relaxation of the ban means the reopening of markets valued at 
25 million a year said Richard Kinney general manager of Florida 
Citrus Packers Inc a trade association in Lakeland 
California Texas and Arizona are the biggest producers outside 
of Florida But Louisiana Hawaii Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands also are affected 
Texas growers immediately imposed their own embargo to keep 
Florida fruit out for at least 30 days while they seek to overturn 
the federal order The Texas Agriculture Department plans to turn 
back any Florida fruit at state borders 
Exporting Floridas misery to Texas is not going to be the 
answer said Jim Hightower the Texas agriculture commissioner 
Californias reaction was more restrained But there was talk of 
legal action and an official for California Citrus Mutual said the 
USDA had not followed proper procedures for public hearings and 
notification to the concerned states 
Everyone must go through the legal hoops and were not sure 
they jumped through all the hoops said Cliff Holland director 
of the California trade associations grower services 
The USDA pointed out that it had held hearings in the Los 
Angeles area in McAllen Tex and in Florida last October on its 
proposal to lift the ban 
Nancy Robinson spokeswoman for the USDAs Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service said she didnt believe the Texas 
embargo would be legally enforceable since it would preempt a 
federal order 
Growers gearing up for a resumption of shipments are struggling 
with a variety of federal rules designed to ensure that no 
contaminated fruit leaves the state 
Willard Roe who has fruit packing houses in Winter Haven and 
Haines City expects to be one of the first to begin shipping 
truckloads of Florida tangerines to California 
But he and other shippers and growers have to undergo rigorous 
inspections by federal agents Inspectors walk the groves with 
owners and obtain compliance agreements before fruit is certified 
for shipment 
Fruit can only be taken from inspected groves and must be 
treated with a bactericide and waxed to remove any surface 
contamination Growers have to attest that all harvesters and 
shipping vehicles are free of canker 
The rigid requirements mean it will be a week to 10 days before 
shipments begin said Bobby McKown executive vice president of 
Florida Citrus Mutual which represents more than 12000 growers 
The joint statefederal canker eradication project burned some 
20 million trees mostly seedlings and nursery stock Recent state 
court rulings raised the prospect that the state may have to pay as 
much as 200 million to nursery owners who received only 174 
million as partial compensation for their trees 
Scientists now say the nursery strain of canker primarily 
produces mild spotting of fruit and leaves adding that neither 
affects the quality of the fruit or juice and canker does not harm 
people 
The Asiatic strain which can weaken trees and cause fruit and 
leaf damage was discovered in 1986 in a small Gulf Coast area of 
mature groves which was immediately quarantined A USDA order 
prohibits shipment of fresh fruit from that region
