US industry operated at 822 percent of 
capacity in January matching the December level as the highest 
operating rate in almost eight years the government said today 
The Federal Reserve said that further growth in the operating 
rate was held back last month by cutbacks in steel and automobile 
production 
The last time that American industry operated at higher than 
822 percent of capacity was in March 1980 when production was at 
837 percent of capacity 
During the 198182 recession the operating rate fell below 70 
percent The operating rate climbed to 818 percent in August of 
1984 as the country pulled out of the recession However 
manufacturers in many industries laid off workers and closed plants 
in 1985 and 1986 as foreign competition cut into sales 
The Reagan administration began a campaign in 1985 to force the 
value of the dollar lower in an effort to make American products 
competitive once again on overseas markets 
That effort began reaping benefits last year with the operating 
rate rising by 24 percentgage points in 1987 By contrast 
operating rates had fallen by 09 percentage point in 1986 
The administration which today released its latest economic 
forecast as part of its 1989 budget is counting on a resurgent 
manufacturing sector to keep the country out of a recession during 
this presidential election year 
Many private economists however believe that growth will slow 
considerably especially during the early part of 1988 as 
businesses cut back on orders in an effort to work down high levels 
of unsold goods 
Economists said the January report on factory use showed that 
process had already begun 
The operating rate in the auto industry dropped by 12 
percentage points in January to 767 percent of capacity It was 
the third consecutive monthly decline after auto plants hit an 
operating rate of 82 percent in October 
Steel and other makers of primary metals saw their operating 
rates drop to 896 percent of capacity last month down from 912 
percent in December 
For all of manufacturing the operating rate was unchanged at 
824 percent of capacity Producers of durable goods such as steel 
and autos saw operating rates decline to an average of 799 
percent of capacity 01 percentage point below the December level 
Makers of nondurable goods saw operating rates rise by 01 
percentage point to 861 percent of capacity 
The mining industry which has been hardhit by declines in oil 
prices had a 03 percentage point drop in the operating rate to 
802 percent of capacity 
This was offset however by a 09 percentage point increase in 
the operating rate at utility companies which rose to 816 percent 
in January The big gain was attributed to unusually severe winter 
weather which boosted heating demands
