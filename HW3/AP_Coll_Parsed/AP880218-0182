Republicans in the state Assembly declared 
themselves unanimously opposed Wednesday to Gov Mario Cuomos plan 
to permit distribution of hypodermic needles to some drug addicts 
to combat the spread of AIDS 
The 56 Republicans from the 150member Assembly approved a 
resolution calling for the issue to be submitted to the Legislature 
and not handled administratively by state Health Commissioner Dr 
David Axelrod 
The way the freeneedle plan was approved is as dubious as the 
plan itself said Assembly Minority Leader Clarence Rappleyea 
The notion of statesubsidized drug abuse is abhorrent 
Republican Assemblyman George Pataki called the plan 
constitutionally scientifically and practically flawed 
The Republican resolution said that dispensing needles to 
addicts not only undermines societys battle against drugs but 
provides a contradictory message to our children who are being 
taught to say No to drugs 
Possession of hypodermic needles without a prescription is a 
crime in New York but the health commissioner has the discretion 
to exempt certain classes of people from the law Thats what 
Axelrod has said he will do when he and New York City Health 
Commissioner Dr Stephen Joseph settle on the details of a test 
program in New York City 
Its a very limited program of only 200 people and a carefully 
controlled test of the idea to see if it can change behavior 
said Axelrods spokesman Peter Slocum 
Cuomo has said the experiment will be closely monitored and 
ended quickly if it doesnt have any impact on the spread of AIDS 
The proposal calls for providing needles only to about 200 
addicts who have applied for drugtreatment programs The 
experiment is expected to last for about six months As part of the 
plan the state is supposed to expand its drugtreatment programs 
that are already unable to handle all the applicants 
Most case of AIDS acquired immune deficiency syndrome have 
appeared in homosexual males or intravenous drug users In New York 
City the majority of the new cases of the fatal disease for which 
there is no known cure have appeared in drug users Researchers 
believe that the disease spreads among drug addicts because they 
share needles that may be contaminated by tainted blood
