President Reagan asked Congress today for 
major spending increases to fight the spread of AIDS and to boost 
support for schools and colleges 
Most social programs showed at least modest gains in Reagans 
electionyear budget for fiscal 1989 as the president abandoned 
perennial proposals for cuts that Congress has largely ignored in 
previous years 
The most striking increase was the 13 billion request for 
research and education on the deadly AIDS virus up by 349 
million or 38 percent from the current level Reagan said 
Addressing the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic is 
the highest public health priority of the administration 
The government also estimated that its cost of paying welfare 
and Medicaid benefits for AIDS victims will soar in the year ahead 
to 736 million from 461 million That makes the total federal 
costs more than 2 billion 
One year after he sought to cut nearly 5 billion from the 
Department of Educations budget Reagan asked Congress to raise 
its spending by 15 billion or nearly 8 percent to 203 billion 
The biggest education gain would be in the Pell Grant program 
for needy college students which would climb by 590 million to 
almost 5 billion Reagan would raise the maximum grant to 2300 
a 100 increase and award 247000 more grants The program now 
helps 315 million college and trade school students 
Disadvantaged children in elementary schools would be helped by 
two budget increases a 238 million increase to 46 billion for 
the Chapter 1 remedial education program and a 43 million boost 
to 115 million in aid for magnet schools Reagan wants to make the 
magnet school aid available more freely and not just for school 
desegregation 
Carrying through on an initiative announced in the State of the 
Union address Reagan said he will propose legislation to allow 
low and middleincome families to earn interest taxfree on 
savings bonds for college 
The Department of Health and Human Services budget would grow 
by 58 percent from 3751 billion to 3968 billion including 
Social Security and Medicare 
Social Securitys old age and disability programs alone are 
expected to grow by 14 billion or 64 percent to 2338 billion 
The administration proposes no changes in Social Security 
benefits Reagan said Thirtyeight million people receive 
benefits and the average retired worker and spouses will draw 
10500 in 1988 an increase of nearly 3700 over the 1981 level 
Medicaid grants which help states provide health insurance for 
25 million poor people will cost the federal government 327 
billion in 1989 up 7 percent from 307 billion currently Under 
the recent budget agreement with Congress Reagan proposed no 
Medicaid cuts for 1989 
Medicare spending for 33 million elderly or disabled workers 
is projected to rise to 84 billion from 789 billion and Reagan 
proposed 12 billion in cuts to meet the deficitreduction targets 
that Congress and the administration agreed to in December 
The budget proposes to limit Medicare payments for durable 
medical equipment reduce payments for radiology and anesthesiology 
services close a loophole in payments for home dialysis 
treatment for endstage renal disease intensify screening of 
physician claims by program contractors and make permanent a 
requirement that Medicare Part B monthly premiums now 2480 
cover 25 percent of the program costs 
The budget proposes phasing out the lowincome energy block 
grant over four years starting with a 300 million cut to 12 
billion for 1989 
It would also reduce the community services block grant by 57 
million to 349 million and eliminate funds for the 93 million 
Work Incentive Program for welfare families
