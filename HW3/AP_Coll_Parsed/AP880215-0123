military official to drug trafficking and said officials of that 
nations government also were involved 
Osvaldo Quintana 35 of Miami told a news conference that he 
was going to the media because the federal government was stalling 
on promises to protect him

became involved with the smuggling effort in August 1986 has been 
testifying before a federal grand jury in Miami about the Haitian 
drug connection

the Dessalines battalion in PortauPrince in December 1986 and 
arranged for 100 kilograms of cocaine to be shipped to the United

Haiti said Quintana The cocaine was flown through the Bahamas 
to Florida he said

second group later ran him off a highway Those men were frightened 
away by a Florida Highway Patrol officer who happened by said 
Quintana 
Quintanas attorney Ellis Rubin said Quintana had been warned 
by the US attorneys office in Miami in January that he would not 
get into the federal witness protection program if he talked to the 
media about his case But despite waiting four weeks no protection 
was arranged for him or his family he said
