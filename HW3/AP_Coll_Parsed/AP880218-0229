of the rundown Lorraine Motel out of her home of 11 years so that 
the site of the Rev Martin Luther Kings assassination can be 
turned into a civil rights museum 
Shelby County Judge John A Donald said he had no choice but to 
side against Jacqueline Smith who did not appear at the hearing or 
have an attorney present 
Miss Smith 37 was given 10 days to leave before the case is 
turned over the sheriffs office 
During the 10minute hearing witnesses for the state testified 
that all procedures had been followed in trying to remove Miss 
Smith and that she had been offered relocation assistance 
Local citizens organized in 1982 to buy the Lorraine at a 
foreclosure auction and the state later took title to the 
property The motel was closed Jan 11 and its few remaining 
residents were told to move out 
Miss Smith a former motel employee ignored a state deadline 
Feb 8 to move out and likened her protest to civil rights battles 
led by King She has said the museum would force poor people out of 
the neighborhood 
King was shot to death at the motel on April 4 1968 while in 
Memphis to help organize a strike by sanitation workers James Earl 
Ray pleaded guilty to the slaying and is serving a 99year prison 
sentence
