A former Methodist minister accused in a civil 
suit of trying to choke his wife to death says he is innocent and 
has avoided his California apartment to dodge reporters not court 
officials 
My response to the allegations in the suit are the same they 
have been all along Im not guilty of anything and dont have 
anything to fear on that point Walker Railey said in an 
interview in the Dallas Morning News 
I regret the lawsuit because it puts all the family the 
Nicolai family and me under an even added amount of pressure 
Railey said in his first interview since he moved to San Francisco 
in November Stories based on the interview were published in the 
newpapers Saturday and Sunday editions 
After Billie Joe Nicolai Raileys motherinlaw filed the 
lawsuit Feb 2 Railey began living in hotels and with friends 
instead of in his apartment 
Railey former senior minister of the First United Methodist 
Church in downtown Dallas said he has stayed away from the 
apartment because news reporters and photographers have staked it 
out 
Im keeping a low profile because people are sitting out in 
front of my flat and I resent that Railey said I know the 
press is doing its job and Im just trying to live my life At this 
point there seems to be difficulty in making both of those things 
work 
The constant attention and news reports have made him weary and 
resentful he said 
Im in a situation where my silence makes people wonder and 
when I talk the way its used in the media also makes people 
wonder Railey said describing his position as being between 
the devil and the deep blue sea 
Railey has said he found his wife Margaret Peggy Railey 
near death the night of April 21 in their garage Mrs Railey has 
been comatose since the attack and is in a Tyler nursing home 
The lawsuit by Mrs Nicolai Peggy Raileys mother seeks 
unspecified damages 
Court officers have been unable to locate Railey to serve him 
formal notification of the civil suit but Railey denied trying 
to dodge the papers 
He declined to review a copy of the lawsuit offered by the 
Morning News and said he wanted to first discuss it with his Dallas 
attorney Doug Mulder 
Railey declined to give an account of the night his wife was 
attacked and he also declined to talk about his relationship with 
psychologist Lucy Papillon who told a grand jury in July that she 
had been having an affair with Railey Late last year and Railey 
signed a oneyear lease on a San Francisco flat 
Before his wife was attacked last April the prominent minister 
reported to police that he was receiving death threats that he 
blamed on his strong procivilrights stance Police later 
concluded that the threatening notes were typed on a church 
typewriter The morning that police were planning to question 
Railey about the attack on his wife he took an overdose of 
sleeping pills but later recovered 
Railey has since resigned his church position
