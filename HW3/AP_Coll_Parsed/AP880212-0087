Vice President George Bush campaigned in a 
snowbound condominium complex Friday telling reporters he didnt 
believe his candidacy would be hurt by Alexander Haigs endorsement 
of Sen Bob Dole 
Haig who dropped out of the Republican race called Dole head 
and shoulders above Bush as a potential president 
Bush phoned Leslie Doppler WKNE news director in Keene to 
boast that he won the immediate endorsement of state Rep Edward 
Bennett of Bridgewater one of Haigs three state cochairman 
Later on Manchester television Bush said Bennett thinks that 
Im head and shoulders above Bob Dole 
I think we can pull it out here Bush said as he continued 
to compare the race to 1980 when Ronald Reagan lost Iowa and won 
New Hampshire and the nomination 
As Bush his wife and Gov John Sununu his state chairman 
holed up in the Clarion Somerset Hotel his campaign staff 
scrambled to find voters and photo and visual opportunities nearby 
About an hour before dark when at least a foot of snow had 
accumulated Bush declared that he had a touch of cabin fever 
emerged with his Secret Service agents and staff and led an 
entourage of about 35 on an hourlong forced march through the 
adjacent Somerset condominium project 
At first Bush insisted he was headed for a shopping mall until 
his wife Barbara told him he knew the stores were closed by the 
storm 
Television crews so bored during the day that they videotaped 
each other in the near whiteout outside the hotel came to life 
when two or three people braved the weather to shovel out their 
cars 
Bush and his staff tried to persuade condominium dwellers to let 
them help shovel or rescue their cars from the snow but each 
declined politely 
Sununu who tried to entice people to allow Bush to help shovel 
with come meet the vice president come meet the vice 
president offered the opinion that New Hampshire people are 
independent 
And Bush concurred Only in New Hampshire The television 
crews were reduced to aiming their cameras at Bush petting puppies 
in the arms of their masters and mistresses 
A snowplow driver finally allowed the vice president to get 
behind the wheel of his machine and Bush drove the snowplow about 
10 yards down an alreadycleared road
