Congress plans this year to shorten by half a 
budget process that in 1987 took an entire year to play out But 
while theres a better chance than usual for speedy action 
pitfalls remain 
Congressional leaders pledged last year that deadlines would be 
met But the fiscal 1988 budget bills werent finished until nearly 
Christmas three months into the fiscal year 
This year theres cause for optimism because of the deficit 
reduction agreement reached last November between President Reagan 
and congressional leaders 
The agreement functions as a budget over the budget Although it 
lacks the legal force of legislation both the White House and the 
Democratic leaders in Congress say theyll obey its overall targets 
for military domestic programs and foreign aid 
I believe that the spirit of bipartisan cooperation between 
the Congress and the administration will carry over from last 
years budget summit to this years budget process said Rep 
William H Gray III DPa chairman of the House Budget Committee 
Both the House and Senate budget committees have scheduled 
hearings beginning today on Reagans proposals followed by 
meetings next month to draft budget proposals of their own 
Even though Reagans budget was received nearly six weeks late 
due to last years extended stalemate House and Senate leaders 
say Congress should meet its April 15 deadline for adopting a 
budget resolution 
The resolution then serves as a guideline for fiscal 
legislation mostly in the form of appropriations bills 
The process calls for 13 separate bills covering virtually all 
government operations for the new fiscal year beginning Oct 1 But 
in the past two years none have been enacted separately Instead 
the president has been sent humongous catchall spending packages 
He vowed in his State of the Union address never to sign another 
House Speaker Jim Wright DTexas has announced that the House 
will try to send all 13 bills to the Senate by the end of May With 
a promise of speedy consideration in the Senate the speaker said 
completion of the task before Congress extended Labor Day recess 
was the target 
That would nearly meet the official deadline of July 30 at 
least close enough for congressional work 
The ontime scenario however depends on all sorts of things 
going right not all under Congress control 
The deficitreduction agreement is based on White House 
estimates which could turn sour if the economy falters Simply 
obeying the agreement might not bring the fiscal 1989 deficit down 
to the levels prescribed by the GrammRudman budget balancing law 
In August the presidents Office of Management and Budget is 
required to assess whether legislation has been enacted to bring 
the deficit down to within 10 billion of the 136 billion target 
for fiscal 1989 
If not additional legislation would be required to bring things 
into line or acrosstheboard spending cuts take effect Neither 
of those options would be very attractive in an election year and 
a renewed struggle could ensue 
And while the pact between the White House and Congress sets 
overall targets cutting up the limitedsize pies in both domestic 
and military accounts could prove difficult Even before the budget 
arrived House Democrats were attacking administration assertions 
that more costcutting was needed in the Medicare program 
It is much easier to agree to them in the abstract than to 
agree on the details says Sen Pete V Domenici RNM senior 
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee
