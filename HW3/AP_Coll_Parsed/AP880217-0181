This wealthy bedroom community could 
probably field a celebrity allstar team for any sporting event 
but its days in Little League competition may be numbered because 
of a shortage of adult volunteers 
It seems to be a combination of parents being busy and a 
little lazy said Little League President Joseph Arcudi who has 
been involved in the sport for 14 years 
Weve only asking for a few hours each week for a 14week 
season Ive never seen such a lack of interest 
Westport a community 50 miles northeast of New York City is 
home to a number of celebrities including actors Paul Newman 
Joanne Woodward Frank Gorshin and Sandy Dennis and writers AE 
Hotchner Robert Ludlum and Frank Deford as well as executives who 
commute to the city 
Arcudi said he plans to hold a meeting on the leagues future in 
midMarch to try to attract volunteers He said he needs at least 
10 more people to fill jobs such as coaches and equipment managers 
for the towns program which serves more than 330 boys age 7 to 12 
If not enough people come forward there will be no Little 
League Arcudi said A reduced season is not any good because 
kids dont learn what they should in that amount of time 
Steve Keever director of Little League Baseball Inc with 
headquarters in illiamsport Pa said he has not heard of another 
community in the country whose Little League program is in jeopardy 
There are about 25 million children ages 7 to 18 who 
participate in Little League in 28 countries he said In 
Connecticut there are 34900 Little League players on 2500 teams 
Keever called Westports situation too bad because the 
youngsters are the ones to suffer 
If apathy is the reason its going to take a localized effort 
to make people realize the benefits of the program so it does not 
go down the drain Keever said Our program is founded upon 
volunteers Without them were nothing 
Little League is not dying said Westport Little League 
Secretary Linda Abraham Our enrollment is up and we are not 
bankrupt There are just not enough parent volunteers to run the 
organization
