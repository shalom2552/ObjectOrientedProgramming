The 30page El Salvador report compiled by the commissions 
special investigator Jose Antonio Pastor Ridruejo of Spain said 
the dialogue between the government and leftist guerillas seemed 
constructive in its initial stage but that a recent deadlock was a 
source of concern 
The report also expresses concern at indications of a resurgence 
of the death squads despite efforts by the government to 
control such activities 
It lists a decline in the number of politically motivated 
executions by members of the armed forces and civil defense forces 
while saying that guerilla organizations continue such practice on 
a widespread scale 
It also said guerrillas have continued to to be responsible 
for maining and killing civilians coming into contact with mines 
they have planted 
The Salvadorian regular army has tried to apply humanitarian 
standards the report said but this doesnt prevent 
unjustifiable civilian fatalities from time to time
