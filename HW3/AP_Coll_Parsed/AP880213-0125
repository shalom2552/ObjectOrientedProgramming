Republican presidential hopeful Jack 
Kemp predicted Saturday he will beat Pat Robertson in New 
Hampshires primary and aired a new television commercial targeting 
rivals Bob Dole and George Bush 
Kemps 30second spot says Vice President Bush and Senate GOP 
leader Dole have not done enough to help the Contra rebels fighting 
the leftist Nicaraguan government 
It did not mention Robertson the former television evangelist 
whom Kemp is battling for conservative support in the primary on 
Tuesday 
Were not that worried about Robertson Kemp press secretary 
John Buckley said after the New York congressman held a news 
conference to unveil the ad 
But after finishing a distant fourth in Mondays Iowa caucuses 
while Robertson placed second behind Dole and ahead of Bush 
Kemps White House bid hinges on at least a thirdplace finish in 
New Hampshire preferably ahead of Robertson 
Asked if his campaign would be dead if Robertson beats him 
Tuesday Kemp said Hes not going to beat me in New Hampshire 
However a poll conducted Thursday and Friday nights in New 
Hampshire and published Saturday in The Boston Globe indicated that 
Roberston is in third place with 11 percent while Kemp had 8 
percent although the difference was half the samples margin of 
error 
Buckley said Kemp would air two more new ads as the New 
Hampshire campaign wound down but neither would criticize any of 
the other candidates 
The spot focusing on Contra aid opens with a picture of Bush 
presiding over the Senate a male voice saying President 
Reagans request for aid to the freedom fighters narrowly loses 
when eight Republicans who endorsed George Bush desert the 
president 
The spot continues Communist dictator Nicaraguan leader 
Daniel Ortega continues his military buildup Yet Bob Dole told 
The Boston Globe he wasnt concerned about Ortega or his army Is 
that leadership 
Contra leader Adolfo Calero said Jack Kemp is the only one 
who lifted a finger to help us Thats leadership 
Kemp acknowledged that Dole voted for Contra aid but said He 
didnt lift a finger according to Adolfo Calero to get more 
money last summer 
Buckley later added Sure Dole has voted in the right place 
But this guy has run for the last year on leadership And the 
question that were raising here is whether or not hes really 
truly had the leadership hes claimed to have had to have gotten 
more aid to the Contras
