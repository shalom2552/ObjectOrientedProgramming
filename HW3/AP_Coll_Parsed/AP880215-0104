Here is the full text of President Kurt 
Waldheims speech on Austrian television Monday night as 
translated from German by The Associated Press 
Dear Austrians 
For several days you have all heard and read a renewed debate 
concerning the person of the federal president that is concerning 
my person 
The discussion is not just being conducted in the media but 
confronts us almost everywhere Questions are being put about 
mutual trust morality and understanding one another 
I understand these questions especially from young people The 
great majority of my fellow citizens did not live through the time 
in question I also wouldnt wish it on anybody to have to live 
through this experience of war Thank God the living conditions 
that existed then cannot be compared in any way with those of 
today so that its difficult for many people to identify with what 
I feel Perhaps you are also tired of hearing this theme with all 
its accusations and contradictions 
My dear fellow citizens you have the right to hear from me 
myself where and how I stand in this debate It is a personal 
concern of mine to speak with you about these questions because I 
want to be understood and because you have called me to the office 
of federal president in a secret direct vote 
Lets look back Everything that is now being discussed again 
began two years ago Then some weeks before the first ballot in 
the 1986 presidential election we were all suddenly confronted 
with severe charges against me 
It was a question of my wartime service and people tried from 
the very beginning to prove that I had committed war crimes and 
covered up war crimes My accusers came from Austria and abroad 
They stopped at nothing manipulations lies and forgeries were 
used against me My accusers called me a murderer a war criminal 
and a liar Without mercy I was interrogated day after day about 
events which took place 40 and more years ago 
My countrymen you will remember much from the election campaign 
and will perhaps have believed some of the charges I tried to 
reconstruct my war service of 40 years before as well as I could 
Much too much remained open Often for the sake of truth I had to 
say that I cannot remember something or that I do not know it My 
accusers kept coming with more new charges and always promised 
proof But the proof did not come Finally I could only counter 
the dirt of my enemies with one thing I said it then I have a 
clean conscience 
My fellow citizens you trusted me and at the end of these 
bitter weeks called me into the high office of the federal 
president of our republic 
As I took up my office I said that it was my concern to place 
what unites us above what divides us I continue to seek 
reconciliation with those who were insulted but also with those who 
pursue me with hate 
My opponents did not let go It was not enough for them that my 
respected predecessor Dr Rudolf Kirchschlaeger took it upon 
himself to examine the validity of the material against me He 
established then that there was no proof for the charges 
Nonetheless the attacks continued 
For this reason I finally asked the federal government to 
appoint a commission of historians to establish whether there is 
any personal culpable conduct on my part during my wartime service 
Some of my opponents as a precaution said then that the 
commission was only there to serve me Now anyone who reads the 
report of this commission or who has seen the television interviews 
of some of the commission members will confirm that they in no way 
wanted to be of service to me I cannot but state that parts of the 
report do not correspond to the facts but are built on 
presumptions and hypotheses For that reason the conclusions drawn 
cannot be upheld 
My fellow citizens you can nonetheless look at this commission 
report from all sides and you will not find the proof that has been 
sought for two years of personal guilt and involvement in war 
crimes This proof does not exist The actions of the last two 
years have ended in the same way as those of the last few days I 
mean that telegram from Yugoslavia which was presented against me 
as conclusive proof and which has now turned out to be an obvious 
fake 
My fellow citizens in this terrible Second World War in this 
curse for my generation I saw and experienced endless suffering 
destruction and pain I was then a young man of barely 20 years In 
1938 a few days before Hitlers march into Austria I took part in 
desperate actions with which we fought against the annexation Then 
came what I two years ago called in a phrase that was 
misunderstood fulfillment of duty I was drafted into 
Hitlers Wehrmacht One must see this without illusions and in all 
truth There were not many chances to escape military service In 
the NS Nazi dictatorship hundreds of thousands indeed millions 
had no other option 
I have great respect for the heroes and martyrs of that time 
but they were as always in history only a few
