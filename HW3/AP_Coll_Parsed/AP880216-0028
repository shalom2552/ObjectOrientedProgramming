Citizens of the tiny resort town of 
Dixville Notch today gave Republican George Bush and Democrat 
Richard Gephardt the first bragging rights in New Hampshires 1988 
leadoff presidential primary 
In the towns traditional balloting at midnight the vice 
president received 11 votes beating his closest GOP rival Robert 
Dole who received six Jack Kemp received five votes Pete du Pont 
and Alexander Haig two each and Pat Robertson one 
On the Democratic side Gephardt received four votes and Paul 
Simon three 
Twentynine of the towns voters cast their ballots in 
flagdraped individual voting booths while five votes were cast 
by absentee ballot Other New Hampshire residents had to wait until 
their polls opened beginning at 6 am 
I dont think it makes any difference if youre the first vote 
or the last Its the vote that counts the privilege said Town 
Moderator Neil Tillotson 89 who cast the first vote in keeping 
with tradition 
And frequently Dixville Notch voters have been on target 
In the primary Dixville has a pretty good record in choosing 
the eventual candidates for each party said Tillotsons son Tom 
the town clerk Its just when we came to November wed 
frequently be in the wrong party 
In the presidential primaries since 1964 Dixvilles voters have 
picked winners eight times a loser once and had two ties 
But in the November presidential elections during the same 
period Dixville Notch voters have sided with the loser on all but 
three occasions They picked the winners in 1972 when they favored 
Richard Nixon over George McGovern and in 1980 and 1984 when they 
sided with Ronald Reagan 
The elder Tillotson came up with the idea in 1960 of making 
Dixville Notch the first town in the first primary state to cast 
ballots 
Tillotson who owns The Balsams resort hotel where the votes are 
cast and a surgical glove factory that is the towns only industry 
incorporated Dixville Notch that year to push the village into the 
national spotlight 
Every four years most of the candidates or their surrogates 
make their way five hours north of Boston to Dixville Notch 
population 47 to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles south 
of the Quebec border They are followed by more reporters 
photographers and TV camera crews than there are residents in town 
Residents take seriously their place in political history They 
make sure to be in their voting booths by 1145 pm so they can 
drop their ballots into the ballot box precisely at midnight 
I think it is an honor to be the first in the nation to vote 
And I think people in Dixville take it very seriously said 
14year resident Gail Barba a registered independent who favored 
Republican Jack Kemp 
We realize there is pressure on us and we dont just pick 
somebody we dont know anything about We study the candidates more 
and we make a decision based on that
