Gephardt surged to the front of the Democratic pack but pollsters 
warned the Democratic race in Texas remained volatile 
Of the 244 Republican voters who said they would probably vote 
in the March 8 Texas primary 51 percent said they felt Bush had 
the best chance of winning the Republican presidential nomination

Bush had the best chance

likely Republican nominee That figure rose to 28 percent in the

New Jersey election officials hope 
more presidential hopefuls will drop out before the states 
primary or they will be forced to rent voting machines to 
accommodate crowded ballots 
Although it is likely that some candidates will fall before the 
states primary June 7 New Jersey clerks cant afford to sit 
around and wait said Atlantic County Clerk Lori Mooney 
Monmouth County Clerk Jane Clayton is not so sure that the 
presidential slate will get any smaller 
Its so easy for them to get matching federal funds today that 
theyre just not as encouraged to drop out she said 
Fitting the entire slate of those seeking the Republican and 
Democratic presidential nominations on the ballot plus 
congressional senate and convention delegate candidates will be 
nearly impossible most county clerks say 
Many county clerks in New Jersey already have arranged to rent 
machines from other states to give each party a machine of its own 
at every polling site Ms Clayton said 
That places on unconscionable burden on taxpayers she said
