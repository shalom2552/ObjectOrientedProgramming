Construction of the tunnel under the English 
Channel is roughly on schedule and within budget a cochairman of 
the AngloFrench building consortium Eurotunnel said Wednesday 
Alastair Morton acknowledged that certain aspects of the 
construction of the 31mile rail tunnel under the English Channel 
have fallen behind schedule but said none of the delays so far led 
him to believe the tunnel will not open in 1993 as planned 
The start of tunneling on the French side was delayed when one 
suppliers for the boring machine went bankrupt and the machinery 
had to be finished in the United States but he said the machine is 
now in place and will resume boring shortly 
Boring on the English side of the channel began as planned on 
Dec 1 and is progressing on schedule he said 
The main problem on the British side is the countrys shortage 
of skilled labor Morton said As a result British contractors are 
hiring overseas Morton said 
Morton said Eurotunnel has spent about 300 million pounds or 
525 million of the 750 million pounds it raised in a stock 
offering last year 
Eurotunnel must use up the funds raised in the offering before 
it can draw on 5 billion pounds in bank loans also arranged last 
year 
Eurotunnel is basically within budget and wont draw on the 
bank loans until the end of 1988 Morton said
