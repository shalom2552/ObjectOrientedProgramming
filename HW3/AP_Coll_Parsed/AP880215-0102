A union official today called for the closing 
of a strikebound International Paper Co mill as company officials 
said they were ready to resume operations following a chlorine gas 
leak that injured seven workers 
Sundays leak the third poison gas leak at the mill since late 
January lasted 10 to 15 minutes and was largely contained in a 
mill building said Willis Lyford a spokesman for Gov John R 
McKernan Jr 
Two bleaching plants at the complex remained idle while 
officials from the state Department of Environmental Protection 
investigated and said they would remain indefinitely to monitor 
operations A chlorine dioxide leak on Feb 5 forced thousands of 
residents to evacuate 
The latest leak prompted a renewed call for a plant shutdown 
from more than 1200 striking paperworkers who say the accidents 
are being caused by inexperienced replacement workers 
Were still demanding that the mill be closed down said 
Brian Doughty a spokesman for Local 14 of the United Paperworkers 
International Union 
IP spokesman Rick Ouellette said operations at two bleaching 
plants closed by the leak would resume later today 
I can just say that modifications are being made said 
Ouellette I couldnt give you specfics at this point 
State environmental officials will remain at the mill to 
oversee repairs on the part of the bleaching operation that 
resulted in the leak the governor said Sunday And the 
officials will remain after repairs are completed and the plant 
resumes normal operation to evaluate whether those repairs are 
satisfactory 
Lyford said the chlorine escaped when a valve failed to shut off 
automatically following a cutoff of electricity that halted the 
bleaching process Another similar plant was closed while the 
damage was assessed 
IP officials said there was no exposure outside the mill and 
Jay Town Manager Charles Noonan said no evacuation was required 
The Feb 5 chlorine dioxide leak was caused when workers 
severing a pipe accidentally dropped a piece on a valve No cause 
has been given for a Jan 28 hydrogen sulfide leak that injured 
eight workers 
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has 
been investigating the leaks which the striking unions blame on 
inexperienced workers 
Ouellette said the latest leak wasnt a human error 
Of five workers taken to Franklin Memorial Hospital in 
Farmington three were admitted for mild to moderate exposure to 
chlorine and were in stable condition said spokesman Kevin Flynn 
A spokeswoman at Central Maine Medical Center said two people 
exposed to the gas were released Sunday afternoon 
Noonan last week criticized legislators for doing too little to 
defuse what he sees as a volatile situation in a town already tense 
over a ninemonth labor dispute at IP 
More than 1200 members of United Paperworkers International 
Union and the International Brotherhood of Firemen amp Oilers at the 
IP mill have been on strike since midJune 
IP has kept the mill in operation staffing it with outside 
contractors supervisory personnel and hundreds of replacement 
workers
