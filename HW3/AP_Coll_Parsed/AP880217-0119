sent millions protesting in the streets and threatened to bring 
down the government has died the Socialist Party announced today

several weeks with a serious infection It did not say when he died

A member of the French Resistance during World War II Savary 
had a reputation for being softspoken but stubborn 
He was one of the leaders of the postLiberation French 
government a member of the National Assembly and first held 
ministerial positions under President Charles de Gaulle 
As education minister Savary proposed a bill in 1984 that 
attempted to institute President Francois Mitterrands campaign 
promise to revamp the nations private education system 
Among other things the reform bill gave local authorities more 
control over management and financing of private schools where 
nearly 16 percent of Frances 12 million children are educated 
The Savary Law inflamed passions for months Opponents felt it 
threatened the basic right to choose how to educate their children 
Supporters wished to hold Mitterrand to his election promise of 
creating a unified secular public education service 
A daylong demonstration against the bill drew at least 15 
million people to the capital on June 24 1984 
Organizers compared the crowds to those that thronged the Champs 
Elysee in 1968 after student riots and in 1944 after the liberation 
of Paris 
Pierre Mauroy the premier at the time of the Savary Law 
controversy said the reforms had been totally misunderstood 
but the Socialists who long opposed private schools withdrew the 
bill 
The controversy caused a government reshuffle in which Savary 
resigned He was replaced by Jean Pierre Chevenment and Mauroy was 
replaced by Laurent Fabius 
Lionel Jospin secretary of the Socialist Party expressed his 
very sincere condolences to the family and friends of Savary 
who served as education minister from 1981 until 1984 
Courageous lucid discrete Alain Savary put loyalty and 
honor behind his convictions He will remain one of the great names 
of Socialism said Jospin 
Savary was party secretary from 1969 to 1971 and was one of 
the moving forces behind the partys renaissance Jospin said 
He represented Socialism with his strong sense of morality 
his sense of justice and his commitment to the decolonization of 
Africa Jospin said
