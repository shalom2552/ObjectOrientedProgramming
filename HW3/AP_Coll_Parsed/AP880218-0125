George Bush flew to Missouri today for 
the first campaign stop since his big New Hampshire primary 
victory saying he wouldnt change his recent grassroots strategy 
and quickly visiting a truck stop to prove it 
Not long after arriving on Air Force Two at Springfield Airport 
northwest of here the vice president had his motorcade pull over 
for a stop at Stos Auto and Truck Plaza 
Sticking with the strategy that had him visiting plants and 
driving heavy equipment in New Hampshire Bush visited the Tin 
Lizzie Restaurant at the truck stop passed out vice presidential 
tie clips and bought two coffees 
Accompanied by Rep Thomas Coleman RMo Bush asked a woman 
You gonna vote for this guy Then vote for his friend Hes for 
me 
Wending his way around the dining booths Bush told another 
woman Thought you were going to have a quiet cup of coffee 
didnt you 
On his arrival at the Springfield airport Bush was greeted by a 
small but enthusiastic crowd as a school band played in a steady 
rain 
Proud to be back Were going to keep talking about the 
issues he said in a brief airport talk I dont have to change 
one iota The message that won in New Hampshire is a good message 
for the entire United States 
One day earlier in Washington Bush brushed aside Sen Bob 
Doles complaints about Bushs campaign statements 
Talk about the issues Keep it on a high plane Bush said in 
response to Doles accusation that he distorted the senators 
record in New Hampshire campaign advertising 
Bush said Wednesday he didnt think his 9point victory over the 
Kansas senator in the GOP primary was a fluke although he said he 
will take nothing for granted in the coming Southern and 
borderstate contests 
In Missouri he was scheduled to speak at high schools in 
Monnett and Friestatt before traveling to Joplin to attend the 
Ozark Jubilee festival before heading to Texas 
The vice president while deflecting criticism of the negative 
ads he ran in the waning days of the New Hampshire campaign told 
reporters Wednesday he wanted to focus on issues rather than 
personalities 
You all want me to talk about Senator Dole I want to talk 
about the issues he said You want to talk about history I 
want to talk about the future 
Bush sidestepped any detailed response to Doles charge that the 
vice president had misstated his positions on tax increases an oil 
import fee and the Intermediaterange Nuclear Forces treaty 
Asked pointblank whether he had lied about Doles record the 
vice president replied I think I said it wasnt true Im 
not going to dwell on it You see I dont want to be drawn into 
something like that 
Dole on Wednesday portrayed Bush and his campaign aides as the 
hatchet men of the GOP presidential campaign Youre seeing a 
mean George Bush he said and promised to swing back if attacked 
again 
Bush during remarks to campaign staff workers at his national 
headquarters here promised that he would hew closely to the 
newlook grass rootsstyle campaign strategy he used in New 
Hampshire as he seeks support in the the Super Tuesday primaries 
and caucuses on March 8 
On that day 16 states or territories will be holding Republican 
primaries or caucuses with more than 700 delegates at stake 
We stayed on those issues in New Hampshire We dont have to 
change a single thing the vice president said 
Bush is scheduled to campaign in Oklahoma City Okla on Friday 
before returning to Dallas to prepare for the GOP candidate debate 
there
