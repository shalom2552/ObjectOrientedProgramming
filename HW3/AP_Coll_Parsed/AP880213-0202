Fresh off the biggest yearly trade deficit in 
history US policymakers and economists are divided about how 
urgent it is to lower the gap in 1988 
The trade deficit is a favorite punching bag of presidential 
candidates but many economists say the Reagan administration could 
make matters worse by trying to do away with it too rapidly 
The Commerce Department reported Friday that the gap between 
imports and exports in 1987 totaled 1712 billion up from the 
previous record of 1562 billion in 1986 
A big drop in the dollar the surest method of closing the trade 
gap would trigger higher inflation by raising the cost of imports 
and straining the production capacity of US exporters 
The Federal Reserve would try to cool off high inflation by 
clamping down on credit which could very well send the economy 
into a severe recession 
Recession would become a certainty if Congress simultaneously 
slashed the federal budget deficit the other step demanded by 
presidential campaigners 
A sudden sharp decrease in the federal deficit whether by tax 
increases or spending cuts would undercut demand for goods and 
services that keeps the economy growing 
Since the United States remains the major engine of world 
growth a recession here would mean recession abroad many 
economists say 
At the same time few doubt the wisdom of shrinking the federal 
budget deficit and the trade deficit in the long run 
The question then is how quickly the United States should be 
moving to cut its trade and budget deficits given the dangers of 
going too far too fast 
Im rather sick and tired of people haranguing the United 
States for not getting its fiscal and trade deficits under 
control Robert Brusca chief fixedincome economist for Nikko 
Securities Co International Inc said in a speech this past week 
The budget deficit is rising but the trade deficit has turned 
decisively downward he and other economists note In December the 
merchandise trade gap was 122 billion the lowest since January 
1987 
Brusca argues that the dollar has fallen far enough to make US 
goods competitive in world markets He predicted the dollar will 
rebound to 140 Japanese yen by the middle of 1988 from about 131 
yen Friday 
Only slightly less optimistic Fred Peck of First Boston Corp 
predicts the dollar will reach the 140yen mark by the end of the 
year The United States he says is on a slow boat to 
regaining balance in trade 
At the other extreme are economists such as Rudiger Dornbusch of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who argues that the 
dollar needs to fall to 100 yen 
Dornbusch advocates a cheaper dollar even though it makes the 
United States a poorer country harder for Americans to afford 
imported products and easier for foreigners to scoop up US 
products and assets 
The dollar must fall he argues for a number of reasons Latin 
America is too burdened with debt to buy US exports at current 
dollar levels Asian nations have become more competitive 
foreigners have gained permanent beachheads in US markets and 
the United States for the first time since before World War I has 
to pay more to foreigners in investment income than it earns abroad 
Dornbusch said he would like the dollar to fall gradually 
about 30 percent more in the next year or so But if it comes to a 
choice between a steep sudden fall and no fall he would prefer 
the steep one 
If it is locked in at its present rate we shall have to pay 
for a much larger and steeper plunge sometime later Dornbusch 
said last fall in an article published by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Atlanta 
To a great extent the argument over the dollars level will be 
decided by the worlds capitalists who decide whether the United 
States is a good place to stash money 
History shows the dollars value is only loosely tied to the 
nations trade performance The dollar began to soar in value in 
1982 at the very time the trade deficit was starting to worsen 
notes First Bostons Peck 
Even though Americans sent plenty of dollars overseas from 1982 
to 1985 to pay for their mounting trade deficits Peck recalls 
foreigners were hungry for even more dollars because of attractive 
US interest rates and optimistic forecasts for US economic 
growth 
Perhaps the optimists say that kind of confidence in the 
dollar is returning
