If the trend by many taxpayers to delay filing 
their federal tax returns continues to spread the federal 
government could feel the pinch right in the pocketbook 
Lawrence B Gibbs commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service 
notes that five years ago 14 percent of all individual returns 
were filed in January and 34 percent in April But last year only 
4 percent were filed during the first month and almost 40 percent 
in April 
If this trend were exacerbated by tax reform the sweeping 
1986 law it could jam the system by slowing down processing and 
the issuance of refunds Gibbs told a Senate Finance subcommittee 
Tuesday As a result there could be a high price to pay 
If we dont process returns within a 45day period after the 
return due date the government must pay interest on refunds he 
noted That due date is April 15 
The IRS is not ready to push the panic button even though 97 
percent fewer returns have been filed this year than during the 
same period in 1987 Just a week ago that gap was 175 percent 
It does not appear that there is an easy solution to reversing 
the trend toward late filing Gibbs said He cited surveys 
finding that the chief reasons for later filing include simply 
procrastinating and failure to receive some information necessary 
to prepare a return 
The IRS is not sure how the new tax law with its lower rates 
reduced deductions and higher personal exemptions will affect the 
latefiling trend Some returns are simpler under the new law 
others are more complicated 
The backlog of unprocessed returns at the IRS was down to 115 
million last week compared with 129 million at this time last 
year The number of couples and individuals receiving refunds 17 
million also dropped from 19 million The average refund was up 
13 percent to 743 
By the end of the taxfiling season the IRS expects that about 
80 percent of the 107 million returns will qualify for refunds 
But no one can say with a great degree of certainty because of 
the new tax law and the fact that most workers filed new 
taxwithholding forms with their employers last year 
Gibbs said the IRS is watching closely to determine whether a 
significant number of Americans may have had too little tax 
withheld from paychecks last year an thus would owe the 
government when they file Pockets of underwithholding among 
certain groups of taxpayers such as highincome taxpayers working 
couples and young wage earners could exist he said 
Because of confusion about the new law and a complex W4 
withholding form the IRS has agreed to waive underpayment 
penalties if too little was withheld from 1987 wages That amnesty 
does not apply for 1988 earnings 
Despite more personnel more equipment and a desire to see that 
taxpayers get all the information and forms they need We are 
concerned that the complexity of the law and the volume of changes 
will provide us ample opportunities to make mistakes said Robert 
LeBaube director of taxpayer services 
Sen David Pryor DArk chairman of the Finance subcommittee 
offered some rare words of praise for the IRS 
Pryor after studying reports that found IRS employees in the 
past sometephone questions from taxpayers decided to test the 
improvements that the IRS has been bragging about Last week he 
said he assigned eight members of his staff to call IRS 
assistors around the nation with some questions 
Not one staff member who discussed a particular problem 
encountered anyone on the other end of the line except a very 
courteous friendly IRS employee who almost went overboard to 
help Pryor said 
His staff is still checking the answers to the questions But 
one thing is sure Pryor said It often took several tries to ring 
an IRS number and not get a busy signal
