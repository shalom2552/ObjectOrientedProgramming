Accusing management of unionbusting tactics 
2500 tugboat workers and other marine employees went on strike 
against nine companies Tuesday The walkout had little effect on 
the flow of goods through New York Harbor officials said 
My understanding from this morning is that boats were being 
loaded said Stephen Berger executive director of the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey 
No problems said Gregory Storey of the New York Shipping 
Association an umbrella group for deep sea shipping companies 
Albert Cornette president of Local 333 of the International 
Longshoremens Association said his 2500 members unanimously 
rejected the companies demands for the elimination of 750 jobs and 
for wage and benefit givebacks 
They have been telling our people Well bust you What does 
that mean asked Cornette They said they would take a strike 
rather than renew or negotiate our contracts 
Negotiations were suspended Monday and no further meetings were 
scheduled Cornette said 
Police established a temporary base on Staten Island near seven 
of the companies which have hired temporary replacements for the 
strikers 
Five firms have locked the workers out and four have not come to 
terms Cornette said He said the union has signed with nine other 
companies and 10 others have unexpired contracts 
Officials of the marinetowing companies refused to comment 
Salaries for Local 333 members range from 385 a day for 
captains to 175 a day for deckhands based on a 12hour day with 
overtime Cornette said He said members wages average about 
35000 a year
