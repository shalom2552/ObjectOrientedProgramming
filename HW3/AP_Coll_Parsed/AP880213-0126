Danny and the Juniors must have had the gift of 
prophecy when they recorded Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay 30 
years ago 
The number of radio stations nationwide playing rock music of 
the late 1950s the 1960s and 1970s has doubled in the last five 
years and the trend is continuing according to the authoritative 
BroadcastingCablecasting Yearbook 
For 1981 the yearbook listed 232 AM or FM radio stations 
playing the gamut of popular music of past decades oldies 
golden oldies nostalgia classic rock old gold solid gold and 
classic rock 
That number had grown to 464 by 1986 and members of the 
yearbook staff at the main office of Broadcasting magazine in 
Washington said recently the 1988 yearbook will list 537 of the 
countrys 10219 stations as playing oldies 
There are indications most are doing well in a highly 
competitive business 
Figures at Arbitron Ratings the service that keeps tabs on the 
nations listening habits show that in many large markets oldies 
stations are among the top 10 draws 
There is no clearcut explanation for classic rocks popularity 
but many in the industry believe millions of baby boomers prefer 
the music they grew up with 
I think it really comes down to the music said WODS program 
director Dave VanDyke whose Boston station went on air last 
October with its oldies format For the adults of today the 
music thats being released just doesnt do a thing for them but 
teenagers also are desiring this kind of music more than whats 
being recorded today 
In New York Joe McCoy program director at WCBSFM said his 
stations oldie format transcended the generations 
This is the stuff parents grew up on this is the stuff they 
were weaned on so theyre translating it to the kids today he 
said in a telephone interview 
In Hartford Conn where WDRCFM plays solid gold rock n 
roll with emphasis on music between 19641975 the stations 
program director Frank Holler agreed the oldies had appeal for 
young adults 
But Holler himself a baby boomer at 39 was most eloquent when 
describing the meaning of WDRCs music to others of his age 
He spoke on the telephone to a background of Peter and Gordons 
World Without Love 
The people love it it reminds them of a very special time of 
their lives said Holler of his stations music There is a 
familiarity that both men and women are immediately comfortable 
with and it has not been played to such excess within the last 15 
years as to be burned out 
I think as long as the baby boom generation is alive with 
disposable income that the advertisers are looking to reach the 
music of the 50s 60s and 70s is going to continue to be 
popular he said 
Garry Guthrie whose Edinborough Rand Inc advises stations on 
formats agreed that there is considerable advertiser interest 
in baby boomers 
Most of them are in the 35000plus range he said in a 
telephone interview from Scottsdale Ariz You are giving 
advertisers a large block of people with discretionary income who 
want to be on top of trends who are willing to buy durable goods 
Guthrie said he has overseen about 12 station changes to classic 
rock formats since he set up business in October 1985 and we 
have yet to have any failures
