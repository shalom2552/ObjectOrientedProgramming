Children who become entangled in selfstyled Satanism often 
share an obsession with heavy metal rock music but its exact 
influence on them is hotly debated 
Police and parents groups agree that more than 95 percent of 
the teenagers who listen to heavy metal simply enjoy it and never 
act out A few become more deeply involved 
You might say heavy metal rock music is to selfstyled 
Satanism what gospel music is to Christianity said Carl Rashcke 
director of the University of Denver Institute of Humanities 
Very few people get converted to Christianity just by listening 
to gospel music on the radio But heavy metal is a very powerful 
reinforcement It legitimizes the nasty stuff the kids are already 
into 
An attorney for one of three Missouri youths charged in the 
beating death of a fourth said they were deeply involved with the 
music One favorite of the client Ronald Charles Clements was 
Black Friday by Megadeth whose lyrics Clements had memorized 
The lyrics in part 
My hammers a cold piece of blood lethal steel 
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal 
Their bodies convulse in agony and pain 
I mangle their faces til no features remain 
I told him that this music just made me want to puke 
attorney CR Rhoades said I asked him to explain to me why he 
enjoys it And he said Its just the energy you feel It gives me 
a rush 
That rush can be a physiological reality said Denver police 
Detective Cleo Wilson 
Its used as a hype and it can become addictive because of 
the adrenalin flow it causes in your body she said It causes 
the heart rate to go with the beat of the music so you get a type 
of high 
Some kids spend up to six hours a day listening to such music 
You add the words of some of the songs to that it becomes a 
way of life for them Because they believe it 
At least two lawsuits neither successful so far have been 
brought by parents who blame heavy metals influence for their 
childrens suicides While sometimes violent the lyrics of the 
musicians involved the group Judas Priest and singer Ozzy 
Osbourne can seem tame compared with songs by socalled black 
metal groups such as Venom and Slayer 
From Venoms song Possessed 
Look at me Satans child 
Born of evil thus defiled 
Brought to life through satanic birth 
Listen to me and Ill tell you 
Things that will sicken your mind 
I drink the vomit of the priests 
Make love with the dying whore 
Satan as my master incarnate 
Hail Praise to my unholy host 
Groups that sing about violence and devil worship cite their 
right to free expression The Parents Music Resource Center based 
in Arlington Va agrees that most Satanism in music is a gimmick 
and the target of groundless hysteria 
But heavy metal violence including songs about necrophilia 
incest rape torture and human sacrifice is something parents 
should be aware of the group says 
When the concerned mother of a 14yearold recently phoned the 
PMRC Executive Director Jennifer Norwood suggested she listen to 
the music with her child and discuss it calmly 
I tell parents not to take the materials away We emphasize 
the need to communicate with their children she said Children 
need to be taught how to think critically about the messages they 
get from the media Then theyll reject these things themselves
