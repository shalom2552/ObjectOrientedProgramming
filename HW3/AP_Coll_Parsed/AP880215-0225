But scholar Huang Youjing a 23yearold researcher of Hainans 
minorities said he was unimpressed with government efforts to 
build up the area 
Speaking in Tongza the minority regions central city where 
markets are wellstocked and apartment buildings are popping up all 
over Huang said the government had neglected the countryside 
I know what Im going to say will bring me trouble Huang 
an ethnic Li said intently within earshot of a foreign affairs 
official The central government has spent a lot of money to put 
up buildings and give outsiders the impression of a flourishing and 
rich minority area 
But in reality the peoples standard of living is very low 
The central government is not providing money to improve the 
standard of living in areas far from the view of visitors he 
said 
Whether Beijings grandiose plans for Hainan development will be 
realized remains to be seen The record of the four existing 
special economic zones along Chinas southern coast all much 
smaller than Hainan geographically is mixed 
In Shenzhen which borders Hong Kong nine years of special 
status has transformed a sleepy rural area into a boom town of half 
a million people But development has been haphazard and the 
economic incentives offered foreign developers has attracted 
primarily basic assembly plants instead of hightechnology industry 
And Chinese authorities are painfully aware that a previous 
effort to build up Hainans economy led to a widespread 
racketeering scandal three years ago 
From 1980 Hainan was allowed to import dutyfree vehicles and 
16 other luxury goods for its own use to help speed development 
But with the complicity of local authorities enterprises from 
kindergartens banks and newspapers turned themselves into 
importers and resold the goods to the Chinese mainland 
The trade in 33 million cars color television sets video 
recorders and motorcycles lined the pockets of individuals and 
enterprises with millions of illegally earned dollars 
This time authorities warn such behavior will not be 
tolerated Our policy is that getting rich through labor is 
glorious However you should get rich according to our policies 
Hainan party official Yao Wenxu explained at a news conference in 
Beijing last year 
Officials say those policies will include offering 50year 
leases on land relaxing foreign currency controls waiving duties 
on imported production material and granting the new province 
decisionmaking autonomy China has said that details of the vague 
promises will be announced this year 
Reported plans to build a modern infrastructure have been vague 
too although some financing details have started to surface 
For example about 100 million in World Bank loans are to go to 
construct the Daguang Hydropower Station which is expected to 
generate 240000 kilowatts of electricity and irrigate about 
164500 acres of farmland by 1990 a press report said 
The need for a stable electricity supply was made clear to 
visitors recently when power outages occurred three evenings in a 
recent week at one of Haikous pricier hotels 
Foreigners whose investments and knowhow are urgently needed 
to develop the island remain largely skeptical 
Slowly however development is stirring New hotels geared to 
overseas visitors are going up many in recent weeks By the end of 
1987 according to Peoples Daily foreign businessmen signed more 
than 200 contracts committing more than 80 million joint ventures 
cooperative enterprises and factories 
Many Chinese from the mainland believe Hainan is the place to be 
and are applying to move to the island by the tens of thousands 
officials say 
This is an open place that has a future said one young 
doctor who traveled 800 miles from Wuhan in central Hebei province 
to seek a job at a local hospital But his chance of success was 
slim he said while relaxing at a seaside tourist area because 
too many people are applying
