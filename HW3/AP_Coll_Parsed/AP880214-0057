This little town of 260 people will have a 
community lunch complete with birthday cake childrens games and a 
lengthy bingo session on Monday Washingtons Birthday 
Its a big deal said Winnie Davey of the George Exxon 
service station The whole community is involved 
George near the Columbia River in central Washington was 
apparently named after the first president although some have 
disputed that 
Some assert the town was actually named after a dog belonging to 
one of the founders 
You shouldnt believe everything you hear said Ms Davey 
which may be a sad commentary on the birthday of a man who could 
not tell a lie 
But there is no doubt the town has taken much of its identity 
from George Washington Many of the streets are named after types 
of cherries including Royal Anne Montmorency and Bing said Ms 
Davey 
Businesses have names like the Martha Inn the Colonial Market 
and the Cherry Tree 
A highlight of Mondays activities at the community center will 
be a large birthday cake created by Glenda Jenkins 
The cake is in the shape of a mountain with George Washingtons 
face on it said Ms Jenkins president of the organizing group 
known as the Georgettes 
The theme is George Washingtons head on Mount Rushmore she 
said 
The 18square foot cake will be enough to feed 1000 people Ms 
Jenkins said 
George actually throws a bigger celebration including a parade 
during the Fourth of July because the weather is better said 
Carol Michael another organizer 
At the Martha Inn restaurant theyll be serving a noon special 
of ham and cherry pie for 425 on Monday said manager Carl 
Keppner 
The Exxon station will also have a special on prepackaged 
cherry pies selling them two for 89 cents said Ms Davey 
But it will just be business as usual at George Washington 
Machinery 
Its not a real big deal that I know of said JoAnn 
Lewandowski a coowner Im just going to work
