Panama began four days of Carnival this 
weekend with the countrys future as unpredictable as the route of 
shambling revelers wending from one sidewalk beer stall to another 
The festival was expected to be subdued this year clouded by 
months of political unrest and the recent indictments in the United 
States of the countrys de facto leader Gen Manuel Antonio 
Noriega He was charged in Miami and Tampa Fla with drug 
trafficking and money laundering 
The indictments deepened the polarization of a nation already 
sharply split along economic lines They caused Noriega to try to 
reinforce his power by criticizing the United States and left his 
opponents confused 
If there ever was a chance that Noriega would relinquish power 
gracefully the indictments in Florida appear to have quashed it 
said one European diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
Leaders of Panamas growing opposition movement acknowledge that 
their goal of removing the general was made more difficult by the 
indictments and subsequent congressional testimony last week by 
several former Noriega associates 
The grand juries in Miami and Tampa and the testimony of 
Noriegas former friends lent weight to what the opposition has 
been charging all along that the general is up to his jowls in 
corruption 
But what can we do now asked Aurelio Barria president of 
the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a leading 
opposition figure who returned home two weeks ago after several 
months of selfimposed exile 
The opposition has ruled out further demonstrations like the 
ones that shook the country last summer when Noriega sent the army 
into the streets with guns clubs and tear gas 
At least three people were killed and hundreds injured in the 
disturbances organized by the National Civic Crusade a coalition 
of civic professional labor and other groups 
Subsequent calls for popular demonstrations met with dwindling 
enthusiasm 
We just cant ask people to go out in the streets and face 
that kind of repression said Ricardo Arias Calderon the 
president of the Christian Democratic Party and another leading 
opposition figure 
Barria Arias Calderon and other opposition leaders spoke 
hopefully of arranging the generals ouster through talks with his 
supporters in the Democratic Revolutionary Party which is closely 
linked to Panamas military 
But they acknowledged that they may not be able to arrange such 
talks and they appeared to have no other firm course of action to 
oust the general from his post as head of Panamas Defense Forces 
Barria spoke of the possibilities of a coup by junior officers 
a presidential order removing Noriega a nationwide general strike 
greater involvement in the ouster effort by the Roman Catholic 
Church and united diplomatic and financial pressure by other Latin 
American nations 
Opposition leaders began talking about a general strike a week 
ago but Barrios said they were still discussing the action with 
various economic factions and no date has been set for the 
shutdown attempt Previous strikes have been only partly effective 
And few officers in the military seem to command enough respect 
to launch a successful coup 
Barria said he and other opposition leaders have personally 
taken their case to the presidents of Argentina Venezuela Brazil 
Guatemala and Uruguay but none of those leaders has yet spoken out 
against Noriega 
Nor has the Roman Catholic Church widely respected in this 
predominantly Catholic country given the opposition movement the 
support that Barria and others would like to see 
President Eric Arturo Delvalle widely seen as a puppet dancing 
on Noriegas strings has the constitutional authority to dismiss 
the general But few believe he will do it 
Still Delvalle was the object of much speculation Grafitti 
appeared on walls in Panama City saying Watch Out For Delvalle 
He was absent Thursday night when an estimated 8000 people 
crowded into a Panama City convention center to pay homage to Gen 
Noriega on his birthday either his 50th or 54th depending on 
differing records 
Noriegas triumphant appearance at the gathering capped a week 
of speeches around the country in which he blamed his troubles on a 
plot by the Reagan administration to renege on a 1977 treaty that 
will turn over control of the Panama Canal to Panama at the turn of 
the century 
That accusation is vigorously denied in Washington but Noriega 
has been using it for months to whip up antiUS sentiment 
Noriega also demanded the removal of the US Southern Command 
from Panama which the Pentagon and the White House initially 
interpreted as a call for the transfer of some 10000 servicemen 
and their 20000 dependents from Panamanian soil 
Washington immediately rejected that saying the the American 
troops were legally in the country and would remain here to protect 
the canal until it is handed over to Panama on Dec 31 1999 
Noriega later said he was referring only to the headquarters 
unit responsible for US strategic military planning American 
military sources said that would involve the removal of only about 
300 officers and men 
During his birthday speech Noriegas biggest ovation came when 
he declared If they want me out theyll have to kill me
