The French known for fickleness in politics and 
love have become so enamored of President Francois Mitterrand that 
they affectionately call him Uncle and his following often is 
compared to a cult 
With presidential elections less than three months away 
Mitterrand is a phantom candidate He says he has not decided on 
seeking reelection but draws celebrities scientists and ordinary 
citizens onto his bandwagon in an effortless noncampaign 
Politicians who have spoken with the 71yearold Socialist say 
he will declare his intentions in early March The firstround vote 
is set for April 24 
Meanwhile Mitterrand is called more and more by the nickname 
Tonton an affectionate term for uncle He has become a sort of 
political superstar imperturbable and lovable in his presidential 
grandeur 
Lacking a declared rival in the Socialist opposition Premier 
Jacques Chirac and former Premier Raymond Barre have a problem The 
two leading conservatives are reduced to shadowboxing with the 
avuncular Mitterrand image at the risk of looking like family 
bullies 
Francois Mitterrand would be well advised to give an answer 
soon Chirac said recently A presidential election is an 
important affair 
Barre has criticized the often abusive use of an image that 
of the nice old uncle Its both charming and fuzzy Its sweet 
tonton 
Mitterrands popularity has risen since his Socialist government 
lost power to the Chirac conservatives in March 1986 He has led 
opinion polls for months but the phenomenon called 
Mitterrandolatry or Tontonmania is recent 
With the Socialist Party not conducting an official campaign 
independent committees began springing up around the country 
gathering signatures and putting up Mitterrand posters 
Groups of noted scientists intellectuals homosexuals and 
others advertised their support 
Actor Gerard Depardieu said he never votes but he bought a 
fullpage newspaper ad declaring Mitterrand or nothing The 
rock star Renaud sponsored a similar ad urging the president to 
hang in there 
Dominique Jamet editor of the rightwing newspaper Quotidien de 
Paris was among hundreds of people who signed an appeal saying 
Dont Leave Us He was fired immediately 
Justice Minister Albin Chalandon compared the presidents 
relationship with the French to that of Marshal Philippe Petain 
head of the Vichy France government that collaborated with the 
German occupation in World War II Many of the French were 
scandalized by the comparison 
Chalandon called the situation irrational and said the 
campaign climate risked becoming one of soft vague demagogy 
Indeed proMitterrand letters being published speak of Dr 
Mitterrand his intellectual firmness and his cultural 
finesse 
A quarterly magazine named Influence quoted a former dancer at 
the Crazy Horse nightclub as saying Mitterrand is not a sex symbol 
but he is so soft with such a watchful air that it gives him in 
my eyes great charm Without mentioning his intelligence which 
seduces me completely 
Historian Jacques Julliard who studies public opinion and 
contemporary political culture says Tontonmania is explainable 
Always in France there is the role of the providential man 
he said in a telephone interview 
As a president sharing power with a conservative premier 
Mitterrand has a high profile without the blame for unpopular 
government policies 
He is a president who doesnt govern Julliard said When 
he officially becomes a candidate hell start losing points 
One of many recent polls indicated 61 percent of French people 
want Mitterrand as president 48 percent prefer Barre and 40 
percent favor Chirac 
In early 1986 when a Socialist government still was in power 
Mitterrands support was 39 percent 
If Mitterrand is not officially a candidate it is to make 
himself desired wrote Serge July editor of the leftist 
newspaper Liberation reflecting the view that the presidents 
refusal to declare himself is a political tactic 
Mitterrand has made few comments about Tontonmania saying 
only that he had no hand in the private efforts on his behalf As 
he put it in late December Its very nice of them They didnt 
consult me and so I have neither to say go ahead nor to stop them
