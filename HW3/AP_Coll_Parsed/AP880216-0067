Rios raucous Carnival greeted the 
dawn today with a spectacular but socially conscious samba parade 
capping off a night of revelry that spread from night clubs to the 
slums 
The last of Rios top 16 samba schools paraded through the 
80000seat openair Sambadrome this morning ending a 12hour 
parade and capping a glittering display of costumes music and 
dancing 
Samba schools actually are neighborhood clubs located mostly in 
Rios poor hillside slums Each one composes a samba based on a 
historical folk or political theme and then outfits 4000 to 5000 
members who sing and enact that theme along the parade route 
Most of the schools stuck to traditional samba themes However 
as 1988 marks the 100th anniversary of the emancipation of Brazils 
slaves this years parade saw added emphasis on the role of black 
people 
Blacks and mulattoes make up a majority of the samba schools but 
in general do not hold positions of wealth or authority in this 
mixedrace nation of 141 mi
