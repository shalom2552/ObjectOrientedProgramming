The end was bitter his helmet dented from the 
combat of the campaign and true to form retired fourstar Gen 
Alexander M Haig Jr reined in his dark horse quest for the 
presidency in a pugnacious mood 
Haig made clear that his new objective was not to seek the keys 
to the White House for himself but to deny them to Vice President 
George Bush 
From the very beginning when he announced Im throwing my 
helmet into the ring the 63yearold former secretary of state 
never rose above the low single digits in public opinion polls 
He stopped campaigning in the Iowa caucuses in frustration that 
his message and his personality had not taken hold 
This is hangover day Haig said when the Iowa votes were 
counted and he ended up with less than 3 percent of the vote in the 
GOP field 
Throughout his campaign Haig described himself as the darkest 
of dark horses 
His political picture never brightened perhaps because he 
failed to find a way to do what he himself said he had to do to win 
Ive learned the secret of life Its in marketing Haig 
told a Denver audience early in the campaign 
And thats what Im trying to do today marketing 
After Iowa Haig had trouble finding a silver lining 
Im in it to the bitter end and that bitter end may be the 
inability to raise enough money to stay in it he said 
Haig has been supreme allied commander in Europe and White 
House chief of staff as well as secretary of state and presidential 
contender 
In all of those roles he demonstrated a vivid sometimes 
pungent grasp of the English language 
When his hopes for Iowa were still high Haig told audiences 
I think its important that a city slicker like Al Haig whos 
been abroad and lived in our nations capital perhaps too long 
doesnt come out here and tell agricultural experts how to suck 
eggs 
Complaining about the Reagan administrations supplyside 
economic policies he said they bore the mark of ideological 
religiosity 
He himself described some of his more obscure references and 
word combinations as Haigspeak 
Haig sensed a measure of public reluctance to put a former 
fourstar general in the White House and his first television 
commercials were designed to counter that 
One listed the names of the dozen generals who have served as 
president asserting that none of the nations eight wars began in 
their administrations 
Ive led troops in battle seen the horror of war I know the 
imperative of peace the former general said asserting the need 
to elect a president with strength skill and understanding 
He said the idea of a nuclearfree world is bizarre 
asserting that Soviet nuclear weapons can only be detered by other 
nuclear weapons not eliminated 
When the stock market crashed last October Haig said Washington 
had sown the seeds of disaster 
Overnight the famous bull market of the eighties was eaten 
alive by the most infamous bear market in our financial history 
he said attributing the markets nose dive to a pervasive lack 
of confidence in our governments ability to deal with budget and 
trade deficits 
Bush was a preoccupation for much of the Haig campaign 
Haig tried repeatedly to pin down the vice president on what 
advice he gave to Reagan in the IranContra scandal 
Were you in the cockpit Haig said in typically colorful 
language or were you on an economy ride in the back of the 
plane
