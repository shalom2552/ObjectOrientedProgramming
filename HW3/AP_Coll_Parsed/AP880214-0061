Tennessee Sen Albert Gore Juniors 
quest for the Democratic presidential nomination comes under the 
scrutiny of Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau this week 
Beginning with Mondays strip Trudeau takes a weeklong look at 
Gores childhood his Tennessee political career and his bid for 
the White House 
Gore told the Tennessean Nashvilles morning newspaper that he 
was a big Trudeau fan 
Hes such a great artist and satirist Gore said I think 
its a lot of fun to be in the strip 
In the strip Gore is called Albert prince of the Tennessee 
Valley 
Another presidential candidate Vice President George Bush has 
been savaged by Trudeau in an offagain onagain series In the 
strips Bush is usually invisible 
I dont think he sets out to be flattering Gore said of 
Trudeau He tries to give people a good laugh and make them think 
at the same time 
Gore reviewed the series before Saturday nights presidential 
candidate debate in Manchester NH 
I think I like the frame best when Im saying what a thrill to 
sit on the lap of Richard Nixon he said
