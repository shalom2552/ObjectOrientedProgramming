Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday his 
coalition partner and rival Foreign Minister Shimon Peres was 
going behind his back in an effort to sabotage Shamirs strategy 
for Middle East peace 
His accusation came the day after Peres suggested that 
intransigence by Shamir thwarted talks with King Hussein of Jordan 
which the foreign minister said could have averted Palestinian 
riots in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
At the center of the argument over peace is an initiative by the 
United States 
Israeli officials said Secretary of State George P Shultz 
telephoned Peres and Shamir on Thursday to say he will visit the 
Middle East after his scheduled Feb 2123 trip to Moscow 
US envoy Richard Murphy outlined the new American ideas to 
Israels coalition government this week 
According to Israeli officials the plan calls for an 
international conference possibly in Geneva as a means of 
beginning ArabIsraeli talks by April 
Negotiations would focus first on a temporary autonomy plan for 
the 15 million Palestinians in the occupied territories Talks on 
the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would begin by 
December even if selfgovernment had not begun 
Peres immediately endorsed the proposals but Shamir said 
clarifications were needed and expressed reservations about the 
rapid timetable and international role Shamir leads the rightwing 
Likud bloc and Peres head the centerleft Labor Party 
On Israel radio Thursday the prime minister expressed 
frustration over what called leaks intended to undercut his 
negotiating position 
Every expression of cooperation on my part is thrown in my 
face immediately he said I show Mr Peres a letter and after 
a few hours it is in the hands of all the reporters 
Everything he does is in the middle of the night What I do he 
wants to know about so that he can sabotage it 
Shamir accused Peres of surrendering to Arab demands for the 
return of land captured in the 1967 Middle East war 
How can you conduct negotiations together when your partner 
runs every day and every minute to the other side and says Dont 
listen to what Shamir says Ill sell it to you cheaper Shamir 
declared 
Moshe Shahal of the Labor Party rejected Shamirs claim that 
Peres was overeager to accept the US proposals 
We are not being overeager The prime minister is trying to 
give an excuse for a period of no movement he said 
In a speech to party members Thursday night Peres indirectly 
accused Shamir of blocking an international conference agreed to by 
Jordan 
If the negotiations with an international opening had begun in 
April when they could have been started would or would it not 
have spared us the events in the territories Peres said 
Riots began Dec 8 and more than 50 Arabs have been killed 
nearly all of them by Israelis accurding to UN figures 
In an interview with Hearst Newspapers correspondent John P 
Wallach Shamir said Its not a question of intransigence of a 
refusal to talk about it but I dont want to make the American 
government fail 
If we come today with King Hussein and the other Arabs and 
try to negotiate about the final status the negotiations will 
explode immediately Israel will say We want Israeli 
sovereignty The other side will say We want Arab sovereignty 
and it is finished It will be over before it starts 
Shamir said a fiveyear period was needed between Palestinian 
autonomy and talks about a final settlement so confidence and trust 
could be built He said that was the concept in the 1978 Camp David 
accords which led to the peace treaty with Egypt in March 1979 
Israel television said Shamir sent a letter to Shultz on 
Wednesday requesting changes in the US proposal but Shultz 
refused 
It said Shamir asked the Americans to drop the international 
conference extend the autonomy timetable and not to set a date for 
talks about the final status of the occupied territories 
The prime minister also asked the United States to enlist the 
support of other countries for building urban neighborhoods to 
house the Gaza Strips Palestinian refugees repoort said
