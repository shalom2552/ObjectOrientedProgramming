Thousands of US farmers will be offered 
classes in futures and options trading this year in a government 
experiment to see if profits on the commodities markets can reduce 
farm subsidies 
Congress ordered the test project for 40 counties as part of the 
1985 farm bill in an effort to find an alternative to expensive 
price supports 
Many people are frustrated with the high cost of the current 
program farmers included said Rep Lane Evans DIll a member 
of the House Agriculture Committee 
We need to have some sort of mechanism to help farmers he 
said But I think it has to fundamentally change If it does it 
will be good for the taxpayers better for familysized farmers and 
a better system generally for our whole country 
A provision of the farm bill requires the Agricultural 
Stabilization and Conservation Service to try to teach farmers how 
to use the markets to hedge against risk and boost their income 
The agency is to report back to Congress on the results by December 
1988 
The goal is to reduce the amount farmers receive in federal 
support by whatever they make through commodities trading in 
effect transferring part of their subsidy from the government to 
the private sector ASCS spokesman Ray Waggoner said recently 
It could be the forerunner of a fancy new program or it could 
flop Waggoner said We dont know and wont until its 
tested 
Farmers will be invited to take classes explaining how to buy 
and sell their commodities wheat feed grains soybeans and 
cotton and will receive counseling as they make preharvest 
contracts to ensure a set price for the crops 
If market prices go up you benefit because you lost on the 
futures but gained on your crop he said If market prices go 
down you make money on your contract 
Farmers have dabbled in commodities trading for years but the 
business is complex and the practice is far from widespread among 
producers said Larry Walker director of analysis for the ASCS in 
Washington 
All farmers would be better off if they knew how to trade on 
the futures and options markets Walker said recently Over 
time they can make more money if they understand it 
But all of this I preface by saying you better know what 
youre doing and dont try to get fancy unless you want to lose 
your shirt 
To ease concerns about losses and encourage participation he 
said farmers enrolled in the pilot program will be guaranteed a net 
return equal to the local loan rate for their crops 
Details remain sketchy but he said Agriculture Secretary 
Richard E Lyng is expected to announce final guidelines for the 
program by March 15 
An advisory committee selected 40 counties in 22 states for 
participation basing its recommendations in large part on requests 
from farmers 
It wasnt hard to pick 40 Walker said It was hard to 
decide which of the 3000 counties were not included 
One of the requests came from Gary Whittaker who raises corn 
soybeans and hogs on the farm his family has owned for 100 years 
near Toulon in northcentral Illinois 
Ive hedged some on the futures market but the options I have 
trouble with Thats why Id like to do this and learn more 
Whitaker said 
If youre very acquainted with farming you know its just 
like going to Las Vegas I throw my money out every spring and hope 
something comes up he said Hopefully we can cut down our 
risk a little bit by doing this 
Illinois Iowa and Texas each ended up with four counties in the 
project while California Indiana Kansas Michigan Minnesota 
Mississippi Missouri Nebraska and Ohio have two each 
Arizona Georgia Idaho Louisiana Montana North Dakota 
Oklahoma South Dakota Virginia and Wisconsin each have one
