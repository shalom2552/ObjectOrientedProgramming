Fear of retribution 
pervades this Arab village which the Israeli army sealed off after 
four Palestinian youths claimed soldiers buried them alive with a 
bulldozer 
Seven men and four women dug up the kids said Rasmi Said 
Hamdan a teacher who reported seeing everything from his home on 
Feb 5 They used their bare hands Two of them were completely 
buried and two had their heads sticking out their mouths full of 
mud 
Usually this is a very quiet village A lot of people worked 
with the Israelis But because they the villagers have talked to 
the press there is a feeling that the authorities will take 
revenge 
The army detained two soldiers Sunday and an official 
investigation began Monday Roads into the community of 4000 
people are blocked with huge piles of dirt and villagers said the 
only two telephones in Kfar Salem have been cut off 
Maj Gen Amram Mitzna military commander of the West Bank 
said Even in my worst dreams I would never imagine such a thing 
even though I constantly warn commanders to expect the most awful 
things that could happen when soldiers find themselves all of a 
sudden commanding and deciding the lives of citizens 
Mitzna said on army radio a sergeantmajor from the military 
government and two or three other soldiers were involved and would 
be brought to trial Military sources said the army did not learn 
of the alleged burial until a week after it happened 
I am afraid I thought I was going to die said one of the 
four young men 19yearold Abdel Latif Mahmoud Ishtiah soon after 
a military investigator questioned him on Monday I dream about 
it all the time 
Ishtiah was interrogated in a white police van parked on the 
muddy road just outside the village entrance 
He and the others claim Israeli soldiers seized them after a 
demonstration in Kfar Salem that became violent as have so many 
since riots began Dec 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
He said the soldiers beat and kicked them and forced them to remove 
rocks from the main road 
Finally they say they were ordered to lie on the ground and a 
bulldozer covered them with 12 to 16 inches of mud and dirt 
Assam Shafi Taher Ishtiah 20 from the same family as Abdel 
Latif said he spent eight days in the hospital after the burial 
recovering from cuts and bruises on both legs 
On Monday he was in bed at his home surrounded by friends and 
family members He said four soldiers had burst into the house and 
arrested him 
They took me to the entrance of the village beat me with 
clubs and kicked me he said and more soldiers brought the three 
other youths They told us to take the stones from the road he 
said After they were removed they told us to move them five 
meters farther 
About 40 soldiers were at the scene under the command of an 
officer Assam Ishtiah said He said a Jewish settler also was 
present and accused the settler of complicity 
The officer took us one at a time and beat us he said 
All four say they were ordered to lie on the ground face down 
and the bulldozer covered them 
I didnt know what was going to happen Assam Ishtiah said 
I thought they would arrest us I thought they would arrest me 
and take me to jail 
The soldiers left quickly and neighbors ran to the scene and 
began digging the young men out 
After interrogation Monday Abdel Latif Ishtiah emerged from the 
police van helped by two villagers Both his hands were bandaged to 
midforearm 
Ishtiah said the Jewish settler had kicked him in the groin and 
incited the soldiers to bury the four Palestinians He said another 
of the young men 25yearold Mustapha Abdelmajid Hamdan speaks 
Hebrew and heard the settler tell the soldiers Well done 
Villagers claimed an official from the Israeli military 
government told the muktar or village leader the piles of dirt 
would be removed from the roads when the village apologized for the 
stonethrowing that started the trouble 
Residents of Elon Moreh a nearby Jewish settlement expressed 
shock 
I heard about it last night and I said it cannot be said a 
settler who guards the gate and would identify himself only as 
Eliezer They the army will punish them 
Daniel Binun another settler said We have a basic argument 
with our Arab cousins about whose place this is but we dont 
have to take the law into our own hands
