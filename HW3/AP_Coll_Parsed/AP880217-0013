George Bush got the win he so badly needed 
in New Hampshires Republican presidential primary Tuesday and 
proclaimed reports of my death are greatly exaggerated Bob 
Dole fumed over what he called campaign distortions and told Bush 
Quit lying about my record 
Thank you New Hampshire Bush said apt words of gratitude 
to the state that revived his presidential hopes On to the 
South where were going to rise again 
Dole accused Bushs campaign of distorting his record in a 
flurry of late television commercials aired in New Hampshire The 
Kansas senator said the ads unfairly accused him of backing an oil 
import fee and trying to raise taxes After complaining for much of 
the evening he was asked if he had anything to say to Bush during 
a live interview with both men on NBCTV 
Yeah quit lying about my record Dole said Im not for 
raising anybodys taxes and he knows that Im not advocating a 10 
oil import fee and he knows that but they were on the ads all 
weekend 
Dole also said he regretted not answering Bush more forcefully 
during the waning days of the New Hampshire campaign saying he had 
been too kind 
Bush led with 38 percent to Doles 29 percent with all 
precincts reporting 
The remaining three GOP candidates lagged far behind New York 
Rep Jack Kemp at 13 percent former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont at 
10 percent and former television evangelist Pat Robertson at 10 
percent 
A sixth candidate Alexander Haig dropped out of the race 
Friday and registered less than 1 percent 
Kemp claimed he was in third place and sought to make that sound 
like a victory We won the contest for the conservative wing and 
now were going to contest fo the whole nomination of the 
Republican Party Kemp said 
Robertson looked ahead to primaries in the South saying he had 
competed in Doles backyard of Iowa and Bushs in New Hampshire 
Tomorrow morning we go into the South and theyre going to be 
playing in my backyard Robertson said 
He pointed to South Carolina which holds a GOP primary three 
days before the rest of the South votes on Super Tuesday March 8 
Im going to beat you there convincingly he said to his rivals 
Du Pont also contended he was in the running with Kemp and 
Robertson for third place He called it a virtual tie among 
those three and said Thats got to be good 
Dole said Its better to win and I congratulate the winner 
I can stand here with my head held high 
Dole said Bush had distorted his record by accusing him of 
backing tax increases Dole who was battling a reputation as a 
slashing campaigner earned in his 1976 vice presidential race 
suggested he may come back at Bush as the campaign turns to the 
South in the coming three weeks 
I think we should have answered the charges I mean I think 
you can be too kind to your opponent and we were Dole said 
They kept saying Bob Dole wants to raise taxes They know that 
was not accurate We wanted to keep it positive and see if it 
worked 
Its unfortunate that the vice president of the United States 
who knows better would sink to that level Dole said 
Asked later about Doles accusing remark Bush said I dont 
know what hes talking about But Bushs campaign in Washington 
issued a statement quoting Bush four times over the last six months 
saying he would support the oil tax 
Dole has said he would consider the oil import fee but would 
rebate the fee to homeowners who use oil for heat 
Bushs victory came after his oncestrong advantage in the polls 
had evaporated following his dismal showing in Iowa a week ago 
Dole forces pointed to that comeback even as it fell short 
We were down more than 20 points eight days ago said Dole 
campaign manager William Brock To have come this close is a 
tremendous commentary on Bob Dole and also on the softness of 
the vice presidents supporters 
If he is going to have this kind of a problem in the South 
hes got a real problem Brock said 
Earlier in the day Bush said things have dramatically turned 
around for him in New Hampshire just as they did for Ronald 
Reagan in 1980 
Bush pointed cheerfully to the traditional first returns that 
were counted just after midnight in tiny Dixville Notch in the 
states northern mountains There he was a winner with 11 votes to 
Doles 6 
Bushs oncesubstantial lead in polls in the state evaporated 
following Doles twotoone victory over him in Iowas caucuses a 
week earlier But daily polling by the television networks 
indicated the trend to Dole tailed off by the weekend and the race 
stabilized into a virtual dead heat 
Bush also found comfort in New Hampshires history of rejecting 
Iowa winners including himself in 1980 
He did what I did in 1980 Bush said of Dole He won in 
Iowa and came in and talked about momentum I did what Presidnt 
Reagan did He came in and started talking the issues after 
losing to Bush in Iowa 
Bush searched urgently following his Iowa debacle for a way to 
better deliver his message that he is the logical heir to 
Reagans conservative legacy 
He was an insulated candidate who rarely made contact with 
reporters in Iowa a time when he was beset with questions over his 
role in sales of US missiles to Iran But with his politial 
future on the line after the Iowa defeat Bush began asking for 
votes with apparent emotion and uncharacteristically climbed into 
the cab of a big truck and drove a forklift to try to display a 
common mans touch
