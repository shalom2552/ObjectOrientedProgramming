A Housepassed bill that would allow 
activeduty military personnel to sue the federal government for 
medical or dental malpractice is heading for an uncertain fate in 
the Senate 
The measure approved 31261 by the House on Wednesday is 
opposed by the Reagan administration which says it would limit a 
longstanding Supreme Court doctrine that the government is not 
liable for servicerelated injuries 
The House approved a virtually identical bill by a 31790 vote 
in 1985 but the Senate never acted on the measure 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 
bill would cost the government about 25 million a year if it 
passes Congress The government paid about 50 million in 
malpractice settlements in fiscal 1986 to military dependents and 
retirees 
The latest bill sponsored by Rep Barney Frank DMass was 
passed by the House after voice votes approving a 300000 ceiling 
on government liability and rejecting a proposal to make the bills 
provisions retroactive to Jan 1 1986 
The House bill would cover deaths or injuries resulting from 
malpractice at permanent military hospitals but would exclude 
treatment at field hospitals or hospital ships and claims arising 
from combat 
The measure also would prohibit claims for mental or emotional 
disabilities unless they resulted from a physical injury and would 
bar lawsuits for damage to a military persons status or duty 
assignment as a result of negligent faulty diagnosis or malpractice 
Although activeduty servicemen represent about onethird of 
those treated at military hospitals they are the only patients who 
cannot sue the government for medical malpractice 
The federal government generally is immune from being sued 
unless it gives its consent Under a 1946 law the government can 
be sued for acts of negligence by its employees while on official 
duty but the same law protects the government from legal claims 
stemming from wartime combat operations 
The Supreme Court ruled in 1950 that the law bars activeduty 
military personnel but not their dependents or military retirees 
from suing the federal government for damages arising from 
government action or inaction
