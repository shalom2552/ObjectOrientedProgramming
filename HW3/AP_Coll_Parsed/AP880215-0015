A new CBSTV series looking for laughs in two 
languages will be the first primetime network show produced with 
both English and Spanish soundtracks a production spokesman says 
Trial and Error the Columbia Television midseason 
replacement sitcom about a Hispanic odd couple is scheduled to 
debut March 15 with a Spanish radio simulcast to the nations six 
top Hispanic markets 
Columbia officials are contacting radio stations in target 
cities and testing sound delivery Columbias Don DeMesquita said 
Thursday If it works viewers in New York Chicago Los Angeles 
Miami Houston and San Antonio Texas will be able to listen in 
English or Spanish 
CBS will feed to its affiliates the episodes of Trial and 
Error They would feed the second language Spanish on an audio 
channel DeMesquita said Then the local CBS affiliate would 
feed the second audio channel to a participating radio station over 
a telephone line 
Hispanic homes would be able to turn down the volume on their 
TV and turn up the volume on the radio and watch the program in 
Spanish DeMesquita said 
CBS has contracted for seven episodes of the program which 
stars Eddie Velez as a young lawyer and Paul Rodriguez as a Tshirt 
vendor While geared for a mainstream audience the jokes and 
dialogue were written with an awareness they would also air in 
Spanish 
The show revolves around Velezs position as the only Hispanic 
lawyer in a prestigious Los Angeles law firm and Rodriguezs steady 
wheeling and dealing to sell more shirts 
The bilingual plans mark the first time an Englishlanguage 
network program has been produced with a Spanishspeaking Hispanic 
audience in mind DeMesquita said 
DeMesquita hopes CBS eventually sends the Spanish soundtrack to 
all affiliates so stations elsewhere can arrange simulcasts But 
network officials want to see if the bilingual broadcasts work in 
the test markets before making a broader commitment to Spanish 
Its something the studio brought to us Its an experiment 
said CBS spokeswoman Ann Morfogen One would have to see how it 
works
