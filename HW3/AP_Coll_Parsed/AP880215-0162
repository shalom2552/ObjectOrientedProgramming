A concrete contractor looked uncomfortable 
Monday amid cameras microphones and crowds of people waiting for 
him to accept an oversize copy of a 6814823 check for hitting 
the worlds largest slot jackpot 
I dont know what to say Cammie J Brewer told a news 
conference at the CalNeva Club in downtown Reno I know I have 
the money now It feels pretty good 
Brewer 61 usually feels at home at the small casino where he 
became an instant multimillionaire on Sunday by lining up four 
7s on one of four Megabucks progressive slot machines Brewer 
and his wife Jo have been regular visitors at the CalNeva since 
they moved to Reno in May 1962 a month after the club opened 
Brewer said he comes to the CalNeva nearly every Sunday morning 
to eat the clubs 99cent breakfast and to play the slots Since 
1987 hes been playing the Megabucks machines more than 200 
progressive slots linking 54 Nevada casinos 
I figure if Im going to play I may as well play for the big 
dollars Brewer said of Megabucks billed as Nevada casinos 
answer to the California state lottery 
On Sunday he ate his 99cent breakfast with his 81yearold 
fatherinlaw then played about 20 before he hit the four 7s 
After the third reel showed a 7 he pointed a finger at the fourth 
reel and remembers saying Come on lets hit the other one 
I think I bumped the change girl waving my arms around when 
that fourth seven fell into place Brewer said 
Brewer will receive his winnings in annual 680000 payments 
over the next 10 years He said he is going back to work on 
Tuesday but plans to semiretire and spend his money on his 11 
grandchildren from his three children 
Our grandkids are going to have a ball Brewers 59yearold 
wife said I just couldnt believe it When they called me 
yesterday I just started shaking and crying then called a taxi to 
get down there 
Brewer wants to look at some motor homes before investing his 
money 
Hitting the jackpot might have made up for forgetting to buy his 
wife a Valentines Day card for the first time in their 25year 
marriage 
This did kind of settle her down he said 
He can do anything he wants now Mrs Brewer added 
Sundays Megabucks payoff surpassed the record jackpot of 49 
million won by Terry Williams of Los Gatos Calif at Harrahs 
Reno on Feb 1 1987
