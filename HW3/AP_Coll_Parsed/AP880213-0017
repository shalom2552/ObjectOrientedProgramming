Planned payoffs to the government of Israel 
and the Israeli Labor Party were mentioned in a 1985 memo to 
Attorney General Edwin Meese III describing a proposed 1 billion 
Iraqi pipeline project according to a Swiss businessman who was a 
partner in the plan 
The businessman Bruce Rappaport said Friday in an interview 
with ABC News that the memo may have even referred to annual 
payments that were to be given to guarantee the safety of the 
pipeline from Israeli attack 
His statement was the first direct confirmation from any of 
those involved in the pipeline project about the contents of the 
memo 
Rappaport was a partner in the project with Bechtel Group Inc 
of San Francisco Rappaport was brought in the project because of 
his 45year relationship with thenIsraeli Prime Minister Shimon 
Peres Rappaport in turn brought in E Robert Wallach a longtime 
Meese friend 
The memo from Wallach to Meese states that there will be some 
money that will have to be paid to the government of Israel and 
either also a certain portion to the Labor Party and I think he 
even referred to some amounts annually Rappaport told ABC 
Rappaport said he did not intend to pay bribes He called the 
payments standard business procedure and said they would come from 
profits from the pipeline or discounts on the oil 
Earlier Friday government sources said independent counsel 
James McKay wont publicly release the memo because it might harm 
his investigation of Meese 
But if the memo is declassifed the attorney general and his 
lawyers would also have the option of deciding whether to make the 
document public They have said they would first consult McKay on 
the matter 
McKays opposition to releasing the memo comes on the heels of a 
review by an interagency group formed at the behest of the White 
House 
Patrick Korten a Justice Department spokesman said he 
understood the group had concluded there was no national security 
reason for keeping the document classified An earlier 
recommendation by the State Department had prompted McKay to 
classify the memo 
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said however the panel 
was still reviewing hundreds of documents sought by McKay 
McKays office hasnt yet been told officially of the 
interagency groups conclusions in favor of declassification said 
the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
Meese said last week he was unable to discuss the contents of 
the document because it was classified 
But Meese said that I do not believe that it fairly implies 
that a violation of law was committed or contemplated in connection 
with the pipeline 
Meese also says he doesnt recall reading the portion of the 
memo mentioning payments and his involvement in the project was 
entirely lawful proper and responsible 
Wallach Meeses close friend and former lawyer approached the 
attorney general about the pipeline in May 1985 and Meese later 
helped arrange a meeting between Wallach and thenNational Security 
Adviser Robert McFarlane on the pipeline which was never built 
Peres now foreign minister has denied that anything of value 
was offered or accepted by him or his Labor Party in connection 
with the pipeline 
The proposed 540mile pipeline was to run near Israeli territory 
from Iraqs Kirkuk oil fields to the Jordanian port of Aqaba 
Fitzwater talking to reporters accompanying President Reagan to 
California on Air Force One denied a report in Fridays Washington 
Post that Reagan would order the declassification The president 
does not make this decision he said
