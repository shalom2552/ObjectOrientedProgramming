Leaders of the 12nation European 
Economic Community looked for a way out of the trading blocs 
financial crisis during an emergency summit today 
The twoday summit which began Thursday stalled for several 
hours through the morning as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
the summmit chairman met separately with several leaders The 
meeting resumed midafternoon 
The summit adjourned within minutes of the morning opening after 
France and Germany threw out proposals for relatively stringent 
curbs on the trade blocs runaway farm spending after seeing 
detailed costings drawn up overnight by officials 
France seeking less painful measures for its farmers as the 
spring presidential election looms declared it could yield no 
more while British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Dutch 
Premier Ruud Lubbers held out for austerity 
Through most of the morning the leaders sat around in groups 
with their foreign ministers in the main conference room at the EEC 
headquarters chatting informally 
Kohl striving to head off a third successive EEC summit failure 
in eight months met separately with French Premier Jacques Chirac 
Lubbers Mrs Thatcher and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
On the steep and difficult climb toward the summit there is a 
dense fog and some people have lost their way West German 
government spokesman Friedhelm Ost told reporters 
He said Kohl wanted a success but not a success at any 
price 
Earlier French agriculture minister Francois Guillaume said in 
a French radio interview that France has no more to give on the 
agriculture issue 
When you reach a certain moment you have to know how to say 
no said Guillaume 
Dutch spokesman NicJan Jonker told reporters It is wrong to 
assume that the Netherlands will give in 
In Paris angry farmers today plowed furrows in the Champ de 
Mars a park near the Eiffel Tower to protest some EEC members 
proposals for cuts in farm spending 
About 50 people participated in the demonstration They dug 
several furrows then left peacefully when police arrived shortly 
after noon 
European leaders argued late into the night Thursday in an 
effort to reach agreement on a number of issues Kohl urged them to 
forget their national interests saying National goitalone 
policies are doomed to fail now 
The Common Market members are grappling with these interrelated 
issues 
Curbing agriculture spending that totaled 338 billion last 
year or twothirds of the total EEC budget 
Raising funds for regional development in the EECs poorest 
areas of Spain Portugal Greece and Ireland 
Devising a new EEC funding formula based on the relative wealth 
of each member state which now contribute 14 percent of their 
sales taxes 
Two previous summits failed to produce agreement on any of these 
issues Lacking a 1988 budget the Community is now operating at 
last years funding levels 
Britain and the Netherlands want the EECs farm spending to be 
raised by 625000 in 1988 France and West Germany both with 
politically powerful farming lobbies have sought an increase of 
31 billion 
France also wants production of cereals a commodity already in 
gross oversupply to be held at 160 million tons annually as 
opposed to 155 million tons as demanded by the Dutch and the 
British 
If we accede to the French we face severe trade problems 
with the United States and other producers It is not a budgetary 
issue Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek told reporters 
after the summits first day 
But France joined the rich northern countries to defeat 
proposals for nearly doubling the 88 billion allowance for 
regional development Britain and other northern nations seek an 
increase of just 50 percent
