Dominating a wall of the Qiongyuan 
restaurant in this capital of tropical Hainan Island is an 
eyecatching red shrine to Caishen the traditional god of wealth 
The figurine explained a waitress was expected to bring 
prosperity to the restaurant It appeared to be working The room 
was jammed with highspending customers gulping bottles of beer to 
wash down earthworms cooked with golden mushrooms and other 
specialties 
Open worship of Caishen in Communist China would have been 
unthinkable not too long ago but today seems perfectly appropriate 
on this lightly developed but resourcerich island which is to be 
the biggest proving ground yet for the countrys capitaliststyle 
economic reforms 
Chinese leaders last year promised to offer a slew of incentives 
to speed development and attract muchcoveted foreign investment to 
this island off Chinas southernmost coast between the Philippines 
and Vietnam 
Since mid1987 the Chinese media has breathlessly reported 
almost daily on the big plans for the island Hawaii of Orient 
a Vast Building Site said one recent headline in the China Daily 
New highways deepwater ports airports railways and power 
stations are promised Official reports in early 1988 indicate that 
a nuclear power plant could be in the cards 
All projects that are helpful to the islands economic 
development will be encouraged said Peng Qinghai vicedirector 
of the Hainan Economic Commission 
The Chinese leadership views the iron rubber copper oil and 
other natural resources found throughout the 13568squaremile 
island nearly twice the land mass of the Hawaiian Islands as a 
magnet for foreign investors 
They also hope the sparkling white beaches that seductively 
curve for miles on end along the islands southern coast will 
attract foreign tourists to a Waikiki of the South China Sea 
The island which local officials often refer to as baodao 
or Treasure Island is to become Chinas 31st province this spring 
as a sign of Beijings serious intentions to bring Hainan into the 
modern world 
Beijings bold plans if carried through could mean profound 
changes for the population of about 6 million people many of whom 
remain firmly planted in the past 
Hainans people work the water and land in timeless fashion 
wooden fishing junks crowd the main harbors while peasants work 
small rice paddies with simple plows pulled by water buffalo 
Others cultivate fields of sugar cane coffee pepper pineapple 
and tea that dot the lush countryside 
In the capital city of Haikou population about 300000 the 
central districts streets are lined with worn twostory buildings 
that date from the early decades of the century In the 
countryside some peasants live in huts of baked mud and straw and 
go without electricity 
Nearly four decades of Communist rule has failed to quash 
ancestor worship and the belief in spirits 
For example clansmen accompanied by musicians with horns 
drums gongs and cymbals can be seen walking in procession down the 
islands main road in a ceremony to implore their longdeceased 
ancestors to return home 
In the mountainous region of the islands interior the Li 
ethnic minority still send off their dead amid elaborate rituals 
that include burials peppered by the noise of firecrackers and 
vintage flintlock rifles and by drinking parties at which rice wine 
flows for several days and nights 
The people understand their backwater island is to become a 
special economic zone Chinas name for regions where economic 
practices can stray from the Marxist straight and narrow to spur 
development and hope it will mean more money 
Were very happy about the plan says a man surnamed Zhen 
who earns 16 a month at a Haikou firecracker store Our standard 
of living will go up our wages will go up 
An employee of the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm in 
southeastern Hainan taking a brief pause from burning brush to 
speak with visitors said she believed that in the future our 
wages will rise and so will prices
