A radio stations gag came to a smashing halt 
when a truck driver crashed into the car of an onair announcer who 
was describing a man undressing 
WBZZFM disc jockeys Jim Quinn and Banana Don Jefferson 
called a phone booth in front of a restaurant and convinced a man 
to take off his pants and start waving them over his head 
The truck driver who was not identified was watching the stunt 
when he sideswiped the car of WBZZFM announcer Tank Sherman who 
was narrating the activity 
A policeman threatened to arrest the pantsless man for public 
lewdness but was persuaded only to issue a warning the station 
said The driver was not charged and no injuries were reported 
WBZZFM Manager Tex Meyer said the Stupid Human Phone Trick 
on Thursday on the stations highly rated Quinn and Banana show 
wasnt in bad taste but it was getting close 
Were not going to do anything that would get anyone in real 
trouble Jefferson said
