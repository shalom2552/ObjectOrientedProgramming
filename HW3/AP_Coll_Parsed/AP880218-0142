A judge has denied a newspaper story that 
accused him of approving a large attorneys fee for Wedtech scandal 
figure E Robert Wallach after asking Wallach to lobby for his 
federal judgeship 
The story in Tuesdays San Francisco Chronicle said former 
Superior Court Judge Eugene Lynch granted Wallach and his partner a 
1 million fee in September 1981 during the period the White House 
was considering Lynchs appointment to the federal bench 
Lynch was appointed a federal judge in January 1982 
The article is misleading in at least one vital respect and 
should be corrected said Lynch in a statement Wednesday 
Contrary to the storys implication wrote Lynch it is a 
matter of public record that I did not finally approve the 
attorneys fees that were the focus of the story Rather in an 
order dated Dec 24 1981 I deferred determination of the amount 
and a different judge ultimately dealt with the matter and approved 
fees 
The judge added I reiterate that in my 16 years on the bench 
I have never been improperly influenced in any decision by any of 
my many professional or social relationships with members of the 
bar 
Finally I know of nothing that was improper or unusual about 
the process of my appointment to the federal bench 
Alan D Mutter the Chronicles assistant managing editormetro 
said today I think if you read our story carefully it answers 
all the questions and we stand by our story 
The Chronicle story Lynch in an interview with the paper 
acknowledged seeking help from Wallach for the federal court 
appointment and that Wallach was a friend of long standing 
Wallach was indicted last month in New York on charges of 
influence peddling for allegedly taking payments from Wedtech a 
defense contract in New York City to lobby Edwin Meese III before 
he became attorney general to get the company government contracts
