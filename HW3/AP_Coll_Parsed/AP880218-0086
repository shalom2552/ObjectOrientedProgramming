John Demjanjuks wife and children shouted 
Youre liars to prosecutors today after the defense rested in 
the former Ohio autoworkers Nazi war crimes trial 
Demjanjuks daughter Irene Nishnic son John Jr and wife 
Vera walked onto the stage of the converted movie theater where 
the yearold trial was held and shouted at the prosecutors 
Security guards quickly ushered them out of the courtroom The 
sobs of the women could be heard followed by an angry expletive by 
John Jr 
Demjanjuk 67 appeared surprised but did not otherwise react 
The Ukranianborn Demjanjuk is accused of being Ivan the 
Terrible a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 
850000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazioccupied Poland in 
1942 and 1943 
He was stripped of his US citizenship in 1981 and was 
extradited to Israel to stand trial for war crimes Demjanjuk 
insists he is innocent and a victim of mistaken identity 
The threejudge panel is expected to issue its verdict in April 
The emotional outburst came after defense attorney John Gill 
ended his final arguments and prosecutor Michael Shaked rose to 
respond to accusations that the prosecution withheld from the 
defense documents that would exonerate Demjanjuk 
Shaked said the prosecution had provided all material to the 
defense on a silver platter and even translated it 
John Jr 22 rose angrily from his front row seat walked onto 
the stage turned and said Youre a liar He was followed by 
Mrs Nishnic 28 who shook her fist and tearfully cried Youre 
lying 
Mrs Demjanjuk then rose and in a heavily accented voice 
shaking with emotion shouted Youre a liar You liar Shame on 
you Shame on you You have no heart nothing She was pulled 
from the stage by two security guards 
After the familys outburst presiding Judge Dov Levine told 
Shaked and the threemember defense team You both ought to do 
away with this bitterness because we believe there was fair 
treatment 
Demjanjuks family said however they did not believe Demjanjuk 
had received a fair trial 
Its all been lies from beginning to end Mrs Nishnic told 
The Associated Press tearfully after the trial her hands shaking 
We just didnt expect the trial to end like that to close 
with statements that arent true The defense should have been the 
ones to have the last say she said 
John Jr said the family believed statements from 21 camp 
survivors who did not identify Demjanjuk as Ivan had been 
withheld by the US Justice Department and the prosecution had not 
intervened to help 
Its been a setup from begining to end he said 
Resting the defense case Gill called on judges to recognize the 
prosecution had not presented the proof necessary to convict this 
innocent man 
Your honors John Demjanjuks life is in your hands Gill 
said I leave you with an Irish blessing May God hold you in the 
palm of his hand while you deliberate the fate of my client John 
Demjanjuk 
Levine said the judges would give the date of a verdict 10 days 
before it was to be announced A separate sentencing hearing will 
be held about one month after the verdict if he is convicted 
Demjanjuk faces a maximum penalty of death
