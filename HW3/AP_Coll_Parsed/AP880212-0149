The dollar jumped higher against most major 
foreign currencies in moderate European trading Friday following 
news that the US trade deficit shrank to 122 billion in 
December from 132 billion the previous month 
Gold prices also moved up 
The dollar surged quickly after the trade figures were reported 
but profittaking pushed it back somewhat 
The dollar finished with a gain of almost two cents against the 
British pound and more than two pfennigs against the West German 
mark It also gained more than two yen against the Japanese yen 
but that increase was spread over two days because Thursday was a 
national holiday in Japan 
It was a good trade number said one London dealer but 
overall its still too early to say the dollar has turned a 
corner 
Dealers were heartened by the news that exports rose 42 percent 
to a record 248 billion while imports were unchanged at 37 
billion 
The report also showed the deficit with Japan narrowed to 479 
billion from 485 billion 
However dealers said they are reserving judgment on the 
dollars upside potential until Monday when Japanese trade data 
for January will be released 
A significant reduction in the US trade deficit with Japan 
would support the dollars bullish undertone dealers said 
The dollar rose above 130 Japanese yen for the first time since 
midDecember trading at 13115 yen in London up from 12995 
earlier in Tokyo and up from 12903 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday 
Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates 
Thursday included 17123 West German marks up from 16885 
14065 Swiss francs up from 13870 57865 French francs up from 
57135 19225 Dutch guilders up from 18961 126075 Italian 
lire up from 124665 and 12624 Canadian dollars down from 
12663 
The British pound fell to 17401 from 17595 late Thursday 
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of 443 a troy ounce 
compared with late Thursdays 44150 
In Zurich gold was higher closing at a bid 44350 compared 
with 441 late Thursday 
Earlier the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of 44369 down 
from 44393
