A former employee of a Silicon Valley 
defense contractor fatally shot seven people and wounded five 
others at the companys offices Tuesday including a woman who had 
spurned him authorities said 
The man identified by police as Richard Wade Farley 39 
surrendered after barricading himself inside the building for about 
six hours Three officers grabbed him as he walked out with his 
hands in the air and he was taken to the Santa Clara County Jail in 
nearby San Jose 
Employees dove under desks and inside closets as the gunman shot 
his way into the twostory ESL Corp buiding witnesses said 
As the siege continued into the evening police negotiators 
talked by telephone with the man who at times was tearful and 
expressed a little remorse for his actions said Lt Tom Moore 
of the Sunnyvale Public Safety Department 
Two women and five men were killed said Alex Michaelis 
commander of the safety department They were not immediately 
identified 
The gunman who was fired from the company three years ago had 
called police and said he shot three people on the first floor 
and as many on the second floor said Capt Al Scott of the 
safety department He was armed with a rifle shotgun and two 
handguns Scott said 
One woman was listed in critical condition two others were in 
good condition The condition of two other victims was not 
immediately available 
The gunman said he entered the building planning to destroy 
equipment but began shooting employees because he felt threatened 
by them according to Lt Rueben Grijalva the chief police 
negotiator 
On the second floor he saw Laura Black the woman who had 
rejected his advances Grijalva said She slammed an office door in 
his face and he shot her through the door wounding her in the 
shoulder 
At least three people had been reported holed up in a computer 
room and making telephone calls to police while others were able 
to escape 
The shooting began about 230 pm at the subsidiary of TRW 
about 40 miles south of San Francisco near San Jose 
I saw a man walk up and I didnt really pay attention and then 
just shortly later I heard bang large bangs and I realized it 
must be shots said witness Norma Kessler who hid in her office 
I was in the office by myself and I closed the door and it 
locked and I got underneath my desk and I must have heard about 50 
different shots over a period of time I must have been in there 
maybe 20 minutes something like that 
Nearby police found a motor home they believe was driven by the 
gunman Inside officers found a quantity of ammunition full cans 
of gasoline and other explosive material Scott said 
Black had been a target of Farleys affections for about four 
years Moore said Farley who worked at ESL as a computer software 
technician reportedly followed Black and Black had tried to obtain 
a restraining order to keep him away he said The two were never 
believed to have dated he said 
It was described to me a situation that had turned into 
harassment He had according to him had given her a warning and 
she didnt heed the warning and he said this was his way of making 
a point Scott said
