PORTAUPRINCE Haiti AP The 7000member military long a 
dominant force in Haiti would be put to work building bridges and 
promoting public health under a reorganization plan drawn up by the 
nations new leader 
The plan a key part of the 86page platform of President Leslie 
Manigats National Democratic Progressive Rally also would 
separate the police from the armed forces and put them under 
civilian control 
There is a perception the army was corrupted by the 
Duvalier dictatorship the party document says But there is 
another truth also incontestable that the army was the victim of 
the Duvalier dictatorship which humiliated dismantled and 
decapitated it 
There must be a rehabilitation to wipe out the image that 
the army is a repressive force against the civilian population 
Manigat as a candidate and now president has acted as a buffer 
between the army and its harshest critics He claims he can control 
the institution that has dominated politics in this impoverished 
Caribbean country of 6 million people from the time Haiti won 
independence from France in 1804 
Following the end of the 19year US occupation in 1934 the 
army put Dumarsais Estime in as president in 1946 took power 
itself in 1950 under Col Paul Magloire and helped Francois Papa 
Doc Duvalier win a disputed election that began a brutal 29year 
dictatorship in 1957 
Duvalier set up the Tonton Macoutes militia which came to be 
generally regarded as street thugs when the army and coast guard 
plotted against him He emasculated Haitis armed forces by 
shuffling retiring and sometimes executing commanders He based 
promotions on loyalty to him and gave away state monopolies to his 
military favorites 
When Duvaliers son and successor JeanClaude Baby Doc 
Duvalier fled into exile in February 1986 a militarydominated 
junta led by Lt Gen Henri Namphy then the armys chief of staff 
took control and ruled by decree for two years leading up to 
Manigats election Jan 17 and inauguration Feb 7 
Opposition leaders say it remains to be seen whether the army 
will return to the barracks as Namphy now the commander in chief 
had pledged before the election and whether Manigat has the power 
to reorganize or dismantle an entrenched military hierarchy 
A Western diplomat who closely tracks political and military 
developments here said in an interview All those who made 
officer between 1959 and 1971 were Duvalier appointees of very low 
quality The officers who graduated in 1973 two years after 
Baby Doc reopened the Haitian Military Academy see things 
differently Theyre more progressive theyre more educated 
theyre more professional 
But theyre blocked by the system theyre blocked by the 
Duvalier appointees above them the colonels the generals who 
are not leaving said the diplomat speaking only on condition of 
anonymity 
The military also has been linked to drug trafficking and to the 
smuggling of cars rice sugar and other goods 
The US Drug Enforcement Administration opened an office in 
PortauPrince in November because cocaine smuggling was rising so 
rapidly in Haiti A DEA informant Osvaldo Quintana testified in 
federal court in Miami Fla in January that the trafficking was 
taking place under the protection of Haitian soldiers 
Armed Forces of Haiti officials rarely respond to such criticism 
or charges The military is a closed secretive organization 
All interviews have to be cleared with Brig Gen Carl Michel 
Nicolas who is Namphys successor as chief of staff Nicolas did 
not respond to a written request for an interview with The 
Associated Press 
The presentday army structure was established by US Marines 
in 1916 to help put down a guerrillastyle insurrection It is the 
main component of the armed forces which also include the police 
coast guard fire department a presidential guard and several 
other battalions and departmental commands 
The armed forces main role is to protect the president and 
maintain security a difficult task given their small numbers and 
inadequate equipment and training The fire department is 
notoriously slow and residents who have been robbed have to send 
their own cars to pick up police investigators 
Military recruits drawn from the lower middle class are paid 
the equivalent of 160 a month on a pay scale that ranges up to 
1800 for colonels and 3400 for Namphy the top commander 
Enlistment terms run for six years and the military is 
considered a good career in a country where more than half the 
population cannot find steady work and the annual per capita income 
is about 350 
Training is limited and equipment consists mostly of aging 
handmedowns from the United States M1 rifles and M14 
automatic weapons a halfdozen helicopters of which only two or 
three work a few armored personnel carriers and some cutters that 
patrol the coast 
For 7000 men fewer than a single US Army division there are 
five generals and 24 colonels 
While Namphy is the commander in chief the 500man battalion at 
the Dessalines Barracks acts semiautonomously under Col 
JeanClaude Paul 
The Dessalines battalion was involved in almost every incident 
last summer when soldiers shot and killed unarmed antigovernment 
demonstators 
The greenuniformed blackbooted battalion which patrols 
streets in this sprawling capital of 1 million was noticeably 
absent Nov 29 however when gunmen with hand grenades and 
automatic weapons killed at least 34 people and forced the 
cancellation of what would have been Haitis first free open and 
independently run presidential election in 30 years 
It is the only unit that is really feared here the Western 
diplomat said noting that some of the Duvaliers Tonton Macoutes 
were incorporated into it The men are very loyal to Col Paul 
He ignores the chain of command and commands them directly 
Nevertheless the diplomat said he was optimistic that Manigat 
might succeed in his efforts to educate and modernize the armed 
forces and reorient soldiers to accept civilian rule and 
participate in national development 
The young officers aspire for change and they see it coming 
the diplomat said The problem remaining is the Dessalines 
Barracks Were waiting to see what Manigat will do about that 
In the next five years well see a new generation of officers 
with diplomas who have traveled abroad who are of a different 
mentality who are young and cultured They can give a new image to 
the army 
A leading Haitian academic who has had a 30year acquaintance 
with Manigat said he is not sure that will happen 
Speaking only on the condition that he remain anonymous fearing 
recrimination he said The army wants to leave the civilian 
structures of power not power itself Theres too much money to be 
made 
Manigat is no puppet Far from it It is an extremely 
interesting battle He makes the army believe he supports it The 
army makes him believe they support him Each one knows the other 
is lying 
In the final analysis Manigat is not capable of dominating 
the army or manipulating power Haitis immediate future is going 
to be as tragic as its present and its past I fear uprisings among 
the people
