epidemic of hepatitis is now under control a report said today

officials in Chinas largest city as saying some patients are now 
being discharged from hospitals and no new cases have been reported 
in the past few days 
Shanghai health officials said last week that 16000 people in 
the city of 12 million had contracted hepatitis 90 percent from 
eating clams contaminated in polluted coastal waters Western 
doctors in Shanghai estimated that the number of sick could be as 
high as 40000 
Reports from the city said medical departments were adding more 
than 25000 hospital beds to the existing 2820 in infectious 
disease wards Emergency wards were set up in some factories and 
schools 
The latest report appeared to allay earlier concerns that the 
disease would hit a second peak this week as people became infected 
from those already down with hepatitis 
The report said hepatitis a virus disease inflaming the liver 
and causing vomiting diarrhea and fever is common to Shanghai an 
overcrowded city with serious sanitation problems

the winter months but in midJanuary this year 130 people a day 
were being hospitalized
