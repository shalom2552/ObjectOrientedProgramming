A former drug smuggler testified 
Wednesday in the trial of reputed Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos 
Lehder Rivas that he had turned down a chance to make more money by 
going to work for Lehder 
Lehder 37 an alleged leader of Colombias violent Medellin 
cartel is on trial on charges that he and others smuggled 33 tons 
of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via Normans Cay in 
the Bahamas from 197880 
William Freeman 42 former brotherinlaw of key prosecution 
witness Ed Ward testified he had joined Ward and others in a 
marijuanasmuggling venture from 1975 until 1978 
But in the summer of 1978 Ward announced he was going to work 
for Lehder smuggling cocaine and invited partners in his marijuana 
operation to join him 
He didnt think we were making enough money said Freeman 
I thought he was acting very foolishly 
Wards group was flown to Normans Cay to discuss the switch 
and Lehder provided a bottle full of cocaine to the guests Freeman 
testified 
He said he declined to participate because of the violence of 
the cocaine business the legal penalties for being caught and 
concerns about the drug itself 
Ward reportedly told Freeman that Lehder purchased protection in 
the Bahamas by paying 200000 a month the witness said 
The money was going to Mr Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O 
Pindling through an attorney by the name of Nigel he testified 
In later arguments US Attorney Robert W Merkle said Nigel 
Bowe has been identified as the principal mediator between 
narcotics traffickers and Bahamian officials 
Earlier an attorney for Lehder attacked the credibility of 
another admitted marijuana smuggler who said he paid bribes to the 
prime minister of the Bahamas 
Prosecution witness George William Bill Baron had testified 
Tuesday that he had paid some 3 million to 5 million over two 
years to Pindling 
Under crossexamination Wednesday defense attorney Jose Quinon 
asked Baron about all the things you made up in the courtroom 
about Normans Cay and Mr Pindling 
Quinon also questioned Baron extensively about his testimony 
concerning Lehder and two of his men shooting up a Normans Cay 
home after an altercation at the airport 
Baron had testified that Lehder and his men had sprayed the home 
with automatic weapons fire 
But under questioning Baron said he couldnt see if any of the 
shots hit the house 
All I can tell you is I stood in the driveway and saw them 
shoot at the house he said 
He also said he didnt see any evidence of gunfire when he later 
visited the house 
Lehder is charged in this case with conspiracy possession of 
cocaine with intent to distribute importation of cocaine and 
operating a continuing criminal enterprise 
Codefendant Jack Carlton Reed 57 is charged with conspiracy
