An offer by Olympia amp York Developments Ltd to 
increase its stake in Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp is a shrewd 
move intended to put the Canadian companys imprint on any 
restructuring plans analysts say 
The Torontobased real estate company which seeks to increase 
its interest in Santa Fe from 105 percent to 199 percent 
launched a 245 million offer Tuesday for up to 14 million shares 
The Olympia amp York offer which expires at midnight March 13 
hinges on payment by Santa Fe of a special dividend The cash 
portion was paid Tuesday and the debenture payment is set for 
March 1 
The Olympia amp York offer amounts to 1750 per share It is 
challenging a plan by Henley Group Inc of La Jolla Calif to 
wage a proxy fight for control of Santa Fe 
I think Olympia amp York are trying to make sure they have a 
controlling position in the company said Isabel Benham an 
analyst at Printon Kane In New York I think its a smart move 
Henley Group is Santa Fes largest shareholder with 157 
percent It plans to wage a proxy fight in opposition to Santa Fes 
proposed 47 billion restructuring plan which is seen as an 
effort to stop Henleys advances 
Olympia amp York supported the restructuring and its 
representatives have been nominated to two seats on the Santa Fe 
board 
Santa Fe which has about 1562 million shares outstanding said 
it had been informed of Olympia amp Yorks tender offer but had no 
comment spokesman Richard Hall said 
Norm Ritter a spokesman for Henley Group said company Chairman 
Michael Dingman was pleased with the move but he would not 
elaborate 
Under the Santa Fe restructuring plan shareholders would 
receive 25 in cash and 5 in subordinated debentures per share 
Henley has said the debentures are another effort by Santa Fe to 
prevent a takeover and is challenging them in court Ritter said a 
Delaware Chancery Court has set Feb 26 as the date for a 
preliminary hearing on the issue 
A debenture is a debt repayable within a specified time and 
bearing a fixed rate of interest which must be paid whether or not 
the company issuing it makes a profit 
Meanwhile Moodys Investors Service Inc citing the effects of 
the restructuring plan said it downgraded the securities ratings 
of Santa Fe and its subsidiaries the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe 
Railway and Southern Pacific Co 
Moodys said the downgrade was based on the substantial 
weakening in the parents debtprotection measurements because of a 
recent corporate restructuring 
About 14 billion of securities are affected
