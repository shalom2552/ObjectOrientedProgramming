A New York state law forbidding loitering in 
subway train or bus stations is unconstitutional because it puts 
people too much at the mercy of police the states top court ruled 
today 
The law forbids people from sleeping in transportation 
facilities or staying there without giving authorities a 
satisfactory explanation of what theyre doing 
In a decision written by Judge Vito Titone the Court of Appeals 
said the statute failed to give a person of ordinary 
intelligence notice that his conduct is against the law 
Such a generalized law fails to distinguish between conduct 
calculated to cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent 
thereby failing to give adequate notice of what conduct is 
prohibited Titone wrote in the 70 ruling 
The court ruled unanimously in favor of two New York City men 
who were arrested in 1985 for loitering in incidents at Penn 
Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal 
Paul Bright was arrested after showing an open satchel to 
passersby at Penn Station When Bright failed to produce 
identification to a policeman he was told he was being arrested 
for loitering He was also charged with possessing stolen credit 
cards according to court records 
Alfred Clark was arrested at the Port Authority after he failed 
to give police an explanation of what he was doing there An 
officer searching Clark had found cocaine and a pipe in his jacket 
The Manhattan District Attorneys office argued that the 
requirement that police give a satisfactory explanation why the 
conduct is illegal was enough to make the law stand 
But the court said the law leaves it up to the police officer to 
decide whether an explanation is satisfactory That Vitone wrote 
makes the law unconstitutional 
Requiring a person to explain his actions also violates a 
persons right to remain silent when questioned by police the 
court said 
He is faced with the choice of either foregoing his 
constitutional right to remain silent in the hope that his 
explanation will satisfy that particular law enforcement official 
or invoking his constitutional right to remain silent and being 
arrested Vitone wrote 
Barbara Sheehan who argued the case for the district attorneys 
office said she would withhold comment until she has a chance to 
read the ruling 
An antiloitering law was first enacted by the Legislature in 
1939 The law then noted that subways and railroad stations had 
become attractive for fakers perverts pickpockets loiterers 
sleepers flimflam men etc who infested these properties night 
and day 
After being amended in 1953 the law was passed in its current 
form in 1965
