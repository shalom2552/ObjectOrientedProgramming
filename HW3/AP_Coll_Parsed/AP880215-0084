Pat Robertson repeated his claim today that 
the Soviets have nuclear missiles in Cuba and Vice President George 
Bush said it was an outrageous charge designed to scare the 
American people 
Im confident this is not true Bush said in an interview on 
a Manchester radio station today 
Robertson first made the startling allegation Sunday in a 
Republican presidential candidates debate in Goffstown NH A top 
Robertson aide later qualified the claim saying the former 
television evangelist meant missile delivery systems not warheads 
themselves 
But this morning at a candidates forum sponsored by the Dover 
NH Chamber of Commerce Robertson said the least we can do in 
this is get those nuclear weapons out of Cuba though he conceded 
he had no firsthand evidence of this 
Bush said he could not confirm or deny the claim but said I 
think youll see it knocked down hard in the next few days 
This is a very serious allegation he said You keep 
hearing these outrageous charges from people which are designed to 
scare the American people 
In California a White House official traveling with President 
Reagan said Theres no indication of any nuclear missiles or 
weapons in Cuba The official spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
The Soviet Union did place missiles in Cuba in 1962 but agreed 
to remove them after a tense showdown between Nikita Khrushchev and 
President John F Kennedy that brought the world to the brink of 
nuclear war 
Robertson said this morning he based his claim on testimony by 
Adm William J Crowe Jr chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
At the League of Women Voters debate he said he obtained his 
information from a source in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
he declined to identify 
Robertson said Some information came to me that the Soviets 
in violation of the socalled KhrushchevKennedy accords have put 
some SS4s and 5s in Cuba which are intermediaterange nuclear 
weapons And somehow in all this brilliant negotiation that these 
gentlemen are so proud of theyve left that out of the treaty 
It seems like to me nukes pointing at the United States are 
more vital to our security than nukes pointing to Europe 
Robertson added 
The surprised moderator Edwin Newman said You say you have 
learned that Soviet SS3s and SS4s have been placed in Cuba 
Twentyfive of them fours and fives thats correct You 
can check it said Robertson This may be a major flaw in that 
treaty we certainly should look into if there are nukes in Cuba 
After the debate Marc Nuttle Robertsons political director 
said the candidate was referring to missile delivery systems not 
warheads themselves Nuttle said he didnt know how many of these 
systems are in Cuba and he said the information did not come 
directly from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but thats 
where some of the information was compiled 
Sen Jesse Helms of North Carolina the top Republican on that 
committee and leading opponent of the Intermediaterange Nuclear 
Forces treaty recently introduced an amendment demanding that the 
Soviets allow the United States to inspect Cuban missile sites 
At a committeehearing Feb 4 Helms grilled Crowe about the 
possibility that the Soviets are sneaking missiles into Cuba 
Crowe said that although Cuba is under constant and intensive 
surveillance by US satellites and other intelligencegathering 
devices he could not say with 100 percent certainty that new 
Soviet missile deployment would be detected 
But Crowe said US surveillance is effective enough that We 
have high confidence that we know whether or not there are Soviet 
missiles in Cuba He said he could not discuss the matter further 
in public 
Helms said My amendment on Cuban inspection rights would 
eliminate this gaping loophole 
Jim Lucier the Republican minority staff director on the 
committee said in a telephone interview that Cuba reneged on a 
promise the Soviets made in 1962 to allow the United States to 
inspect the missile sets 
The KennedyKhrushchev agreement was the first INF treaty 
said Lucier Theres been repeated violations We need to go 
there and look and see whats there
