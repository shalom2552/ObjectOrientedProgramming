A Soviet deputy foreign minister said today that 
the superpower arms talks in Geneva had deteriorated and that the 
United States was blocking agreement on cuts in intercontinental 
nuclear arms 
It is difficult to forecast with a sufficient degree of 
certainty how these negotiations will proceed further Vladimir 
Petrovsky said in a speech to the 40nation Conference on 
Disarmament 
He said the Soviet Union hopes that the visit of Secretary of 
State George Shultz to Moscow next week will provide the 
necessary clarity as to the further intentions of the US side 
regarding the arms talks in Geneva 
The two sides have said they are trying to conclude a treaty on 
reducing their intercontinental or strategic nuclear forces by 50 
percent in time for an expected USSoviet summit meeting in May 
or June But both sides have said a summit could be held even if a 
treaty were not ready for signing 
Petrovsky said the Soviet Union is convinced that a treaty 
could still be prepared in time for signing at a summit in the 
first half of this year But he said A whole set of rather 
difficult issues remains to be solved 
He reiterated the Soviet position that the main issue still to 
be resolved is the question of compliance with the 1972 
AntiBallistic Missile treaty 
Senior US arms control adviser Edward Rowny said Monday in 
Boston that the Soviets were using delaying tactics at the Geneva 
talks He said the Soviets could speed up progress on strategic 
arms reductions by abandoning their efforts to link such reductions 
to US Strategic Defense Initiative research 
Petrovsky said the US position at the talks impedes reaching 
agreement on the reductions in strategic offensive arms For 
example he said the United States was refusing to include limits 
on sealaunched cruise missiles because they say such limits would 
be difficult to verify 
This being so the situation at the space and nuclear talks 
has now noticeably deteriorated said Petrovsky 
Petrovsky also suggested that the Conference on Disarmament the 
worlds only multilateral disarmament negotiating forum start 
negotiating on eliminating nuclear weapons in all countries which 
possess them 
At a press conference he said the time has come to take 
into account the nuclear arsenals of China Britain and France as 
well as of the United States and Soviet Union which are already 
negotiating reductions in their forces 
The Soviet Union suggests to start immediately identifying in 
practice the substance of possible multilateral measures in this 
field he said
