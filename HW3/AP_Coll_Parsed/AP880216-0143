Another field trial has been approved for 
testing genetically altered tomato plants that can survive spraying 
of a chemical herbicide to kill surrounding weeds the Agriculture 
Department said Tuesday 
James W Glosser acting administrator of the departments 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said a permit for the 
field test was issued to E I du Pont de Nemours amp Co 
Wilmington Del The company expects to begin testing this spring 
near Brandenton Fla 
The genetically engineered plants were designed to tolerate 
sulfonylurea described as a new class of lowrisk chemical weed 
killers Glosser said his agency completed a thorough review of 
the methodology and scientific data and determined that the tests 
would not have a significant impact on the environment 
By using plants that can withstand herbicides farmers could 
kill weeds without having to worry about hurting their crops 
The du Pont field trial is the third test approved by the USDA 
agency Previously permits were issued to Calgene Inc Davis 
Calif for tobacco and tomato plants that tolerate the herbicides 
bromoxynil and glyphosate 
Glosser said the field tests are all similar Two groups of 
plants one genetically engineered and the other conventionally 
grown are sprayed with the same herbicide
