Police say one of cracks most frightening aspects is heavy 
teenage involvement 
Weve got kids going to school with 3000 and business 
beepers in their pockets Gilliam said They dont want to be 
brain surgeons They want to be instantly gratified You have 
immature adolescents with no goals Give them a gun Put them on 
crack They have no compunction about killing someone 
Gilliam said their philosophy is You live fast you die 
young you make a beautiful corpse 
He said teens including his daughter are so jaded they read 
obituaries She wants to know who in her age group has been 
shot he said Its a damn Vietnam body count Its a whole 
different society out there 
Teens also know if they get caught theyre relatively immune 
at least from long stretches of time because 85 percent are out 
of prison in 15 months said Ron Schigur of the county prosecutors 
office 
A 15yearold can be waived to adult court he said but judges 
are often reluctant to allow that 
Crack however spans all ages In December police arrested a 
72yearold woman and said they found crack in her sock 
Trafficking often occurs in houses where violence and sex are 
commonplace Police tell of finding rotting bodies in basements and 
13yearold girls offered as incentives for deals 
Trading sex for crack has been tied to a phenomenal increase in 
penicillinaseproducing neisseria gonorrhea Michigan had 2797 
cases last year up from 187 in 1986 probably the fastest rate of 
increase in the nation said Tim Lindman of the Michigan Department 
of Public Health Most were in Detroit 
Theres a good deal of sex going on in crack houses basically 
anonymous sex said George Gaines deputy director of Detroits 
Health Department People are saying I dont know who it was 
This was a onetime situation 
Although the crackdown may ease some of these troubles Detroit 
still has problems 
Residential drug treatment programs are crowded And the Wayne 
County Jail was overcrowded 83 percent of the time in 1987 Ficano 
said noting that triplebunking or building a new jail are among 
options considered 
While many support the crackdown experts say it isnt a 
complete solution 
This is going after the supply We still have a population 
that wants drugs and will find a way to get them said Jacqueline 
Morrison senior project consultant at the Wayne State Research 
Addiction Institute 
Experts also say churches parents and schools must play a role 
in education and attitudes must change 
People must recognize the fact that when folks dont have 
jobs then they feel hopeless and they turn to hopeless things like 
drugs said Wayne County Commissioner Alberta TinsleyWilliams 
Still she said the raids are a beginning 
Theres a sense of urgency in Detroit she said Youve 
got to start somewhere
