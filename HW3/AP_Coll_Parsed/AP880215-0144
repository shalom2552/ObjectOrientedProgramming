Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson said 
Monday he will donate 50000 for the college education of Tawana 
Brawley who says she was the victim of a racially motivated attack 
near her Dutchess County home 
Tyson also announced plans for a foundation to aid young crime 
victims The foundation would be supported by an annual fundraiser 
possibly including a boxing exhibition by Tyson 
Tyson said details would be worked out by boxing promoter Don 
King who joined Tyson at a news conference and promised to match 
the champions pledge of 50000 
Tyson his wife and King visited Miss Brawley at her home for 
several hours Saturday She told the boxer I always wanted to go 
out with you and gave him a handwritten note of thanks King 
said 
The foundation starts with her but its open to any kids that 
are abused Tyson said They need the necessities to make it in 
this world That means education 
Miss Brawley a 16yearold high school student in Wappingers 
Falls NY says she was assaulted raped and smeared with racial 
epithets in December by six white men one of whom allegedly 
flashed a police badge 
She was found stuffed in a garbage bag with nigger and 
KKK etched in charcoal across her breasts 
She had refused to cooperate with investigators on the advice of 
her lawyers black activists Alton Maddox and C Vernon Mason 
But after a meeting with Gov Mario Cuomo last week they said 
they were willing to let her cooperate with an investigation headed 
by state Attorney General Robert Abrams They are scheduled to meet 
with Abrams on Tuesday 
Tyson did not comment Monday on the criminal investigation but 
commented it looks as if no ones going to get caught because 
residents of such a small town might be reluctant to talk with 
authorities 
Last week comedian Bill Cosby and Essence Communications owner 
Ed Lewis announced a 25000 reward for information about her case 
Tyson denied a published report that he had volunteered to act 
as Miss Brawleys personal escort But the boxer said she asked 
him Are you gonna beat people up for me 
Ill do whatever you want me to he said he responded
