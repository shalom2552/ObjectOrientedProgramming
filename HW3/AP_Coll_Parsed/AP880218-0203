Moslem militiamen searched raindrenched 
citrus groves and valley caves Thursday for Lt Col William R 
Higgins and their leaders threatened to go after his kidnappers 
unless the US Marine is freed soon 
We want Higgins back and we have no red line as far as his 
case is concerned said Daoud Daoud of the moderate Shiite 
militia Amal the dominant force around the ancient port of Tyre 
UN peacekeeping troops and about 1500 Amal militiamen 
virtually sealed off a 300squaremile area 
An anonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility for 
Wednesdays abduction in the name of a previously unknown group He 
claimed Higgins who commands UN truce observers in south 
Lebanon is a CIA agent 
US State Department spokesman Charles Redman denied Thursday 
that Higgins had any CIA connections There was a claim that Lt 
Col Higgins was associated with the CIA That is not true 
The abduction brings the number of foreign hostages in Lebanon 
to 25 including nine Americans Most are believed held by 
proIranian Shiite extremists whose main Hezbollah militia has 
been challenging Amals dominance in south Lebanon 
An Arabicspeaking man said in the telephone call to a Western 
news agency in Beirut that he represented the Islamic Revolutionary 
Brigades and declared 
William Higgins has joined the hostages He will only come out 
after he is tried on grounds that he is one of the directors of the 
CIA in south Lebanon Higgins is now out of Beirut after he was 
brought out from the south 
He said a statement and photograph of Higgins would be released 
soon There was no way to authenticate the claim 
Higgins a 43yearold native of Danville Ky heads the 
76member observer group attached to the UN Interim Force in 
Lebanon the peacekeeping force in south Lebanon known as UNIFIL 
Officers under his command represent 16 nations 
Daoud is military commander of Amal the Shiite militia led by 
Justice Minister Nabih Berri He said in south Lebanon Were 
capable of confronting the people whove carried out the abduction 
if need be but I hope a quick happy ending will be accomplished 
He and senior aides told reporters they believed Higgins and the 
captors still were in an area southeast of Tyre which is 50 miles 
south of Beirut 
Timur Goksel spokesman for UNIFIL agreed We do not have any 
reason to believe that he is out of the south Goksel said at 
headquarters in Naqoura just north of the Israeli border 
When Higgins was seized he was violating UN rules for travel 
by Americans in dangerous areas Goksel said but the colonel 
felt he couldnt abide by these restrictions Higgins felt 
that as chief he should be out with his men and know what they are 
doing 
American members of UN forces are restricted to the 
headquarters area and are permitted to travel in Lebanon only with 
a UN military escort he said 
An Amal spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
Despite heavy rain the search has been completed in areas north 
and east of Tyre We are focusing now on Wadi Jilo southeast of 
Tyre 
Wadi Jilo six miles southeast of Tyre is a stronghold of the 
Iranianbacked Hezbollah or Party of God 
Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for factions holding 
most of the captive foreigners The hostage held longest is Terry 
A Anderson 40 chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated 
Press abducted March 16 1985 
Higgins father died Thursday in Louisville Ky of congestive 
heart failure The family learned of the abduction while trying 
notify the Marine officer that William F Higgins was near death 
Daoud and his aides met at a Lebanese army barracks in Tyre with 
UNIFIL officers led by Lt Col Tor Planting of Finland to 
coordinate the search effort 
We hope the kidnappers will have no chance of slipping out 
with their captive the Amal spokesman said 
Cars manned by plainclothes Amal security men blocked roads 
along the Litani River from the Mediterranean coast to the slopes 
of Mount Hermon about 25 miles inland 
Uniformed militiamen with submachine guns and rocketpropelled 
grenade launchers patrolled a 12mile stretch of coast from the 
Qassmieh Bridge north of Tyre to the kidnap scene three miles south 
of the city the spokesman said 
Our men are searching villages in an 800squarekilometer 
300square mile area north east and south of Tyre he said 
UN troops block the southern exits of the region 
Berri has issued orders that no one sleeps until we get the 
man Higgins back the spokesman said adding that Amal is 
anxious to protect and safeguard UNIFIL regardless of the 
nationality of the peacekeepers Amal views Higgins abduction as a 
deliberate challenge 
UNIFIL operates in predominantly Shiite areas frequently caught 
in the crossfire of Israels battles with Palestinian guerrillas 
and Shiite extremists loyal to Iran 
Security sources said French UN officers had interviewed a 
Lebanese bus driver who claimed he saw the abduction from a few 
yards away 
The Frenchmen have managed to draw a face sketch of the gunman 
the eyewitness says he saw pointing his pistol to Higgins head as 
he forced him into the kidnappers car one said 
Officials have said two gunmen in a Volvo kidnapped Higgins 
after blocking his car on a coastal highway 
Higgins was the third UN official kidnapped in south Lebanon in 
three weeks The other two a Swede and Norwegian of the UN 
Relief and Works Agency were seized Feb 5 near Sidon midway 
between Tyre and Beirut
