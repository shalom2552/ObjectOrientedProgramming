President Kurt Waldheim dismissed a 
rising chorus of calls for his resignation by saying he would not 
retreat in the face of slanders hateful demonstrations and 
wholesale condemnations 
In a nationally televised speech on Monday Waldheim said his 
conscience was clear about his wartime conduct and he appealed for 
the trust of you my dear Austrians and for national unity 
But by reiterating his refusal to quit in the 14minute speech 
the president appeared certain to deepen divisions in Austria 
caused by a report by a panel of international historians on his 
wartime past 
In the 202page report issued last week the six historians 
questioned Waldheims moral integrity saying he was in close 
proximity to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did nothing 
to stop them 
Though the panel said it found no evidence Waldheim had 
committed war crimes it concluded he tried to cover up his 
involvement in World War II which was disclosed nearly two years 
ago during the presidential campaign 
The government appointed the panel at Waldheims request after 
the United States put him on a list of undesirable aliens which 
effectively forbids him to enter the United States 
Walheim a former UN secretarygeneral admitted in Mondays 
speech that he might have erred in not discussing his past as a 
German army lieutenant in the Balkans from 1942 to 1945 But he 
insisted he had never tried to conceal it and had a clear 
conscience 
Without giving specifics he told Austrias 75 million citizen 
that parts of the report do not correspond to the facts but are 
built on presumptions and hypotheses For that reason the 
conclusions drawn cannot be upheld 
Waldheim 69 appealed both to World War II compatriots and 
those too young to know the horrors of this war to judge for 
themselves whether your president is the distorted picture of 
this officer of the Wehrmacht or a man who for decades of his 
life worked for justice tolerance and peace 
He said resigning would be against the wishes of those who 
elected him 
Waldheim said a convincing majority had elected him to a 
sixyear term in June 1986 and added A head of state must not 
retreat in the face of slanders hateful demonstrations and 
wholesale condemnations 
Waldheim won 536 percent of the vote in a runoff 
Calls for Waldheims resignation including street 
demonstrations have increased since the report was issued 
In an 80minute interview for ABCTVs Nightline program 
broadcast early today Waldheim said his military service in 
Hitlers army was a common experience for Austrians 
If one pretends that I was lying because I did not give all 
the details of my military career right from the beginning this is 
not something that I can accept he said 
Serving in the German army was the normal fate of a young 
Austrian of lets say 20 22 years of age To make him responsible 
for the wrongdoings of Hitler or the Nazi army which I condemned 
this in not fair 
Socialist politicians who opposed Waldheims election as 
titular head of state were swift to condemn the speech But the 
presidents conservative backers in the Peoples Party lauded the 
performance 
The two parties have governed in an increasingly fractious 
coalition since national elections in November 1986 left neither 
with a clear majority 
Socialist Party Secretary Heinrich Keller called the speech a 
great disappointment and indicated the country could do without 
Waldheim as president 
The Socialists have stopped short of calling outright for 
Waldheims resignation On Sunday however Socialist Chancellor 
Franz Vranitzky said that he might resign if too much of his time 
is consumed by the Waldheim affair 
Alois Mock Austrias deputy chancellor and head of the Peoples 
Party said Waldheims speech was brutally open and maintained 
that the fuss would soon die down 
But Economics Minister Robert Graf another leading 
conservative said in a radio interview that Waldheim must take a 
decision which is very important for our country 
In a radio interview several hours before the president spoke 
Graf said he was concerned about Austrias tainted image and 
praised the comments Vranitzky made Sunday
