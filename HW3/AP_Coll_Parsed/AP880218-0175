Vincent Gardenia nominated for an 
Academy Award for best supporting actor says hes been preparing 
for his role in Moonstruck all his life 
Ive absorbed my own Italian heritage and I remember my 
father my mother and my grandfather Gardenia said Wednesday 
after the Oscar nominations were announced I grew up in an 
Italian community and still live in one in Brooklyn 
Gardenia portrayed Cosmo Castorini a rich plumber who fears 
growing old and has an extramarital affair in the hope of regaining 
his youth 
I felt he was very real Gardenia said of his character 
And I thought it was good that we were able to show an Italian 
man who was not a thief or any other stereotype Instead he was 
just an ordinary man capable of showing emotion and being 
sentimental 
Gardenia is starring in the Broadway play Im Not Rappaport 
at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center through Sunday

Pulitzer Prizewinning cartoonist Garry 
Trudeau says writing for television is similar to drawing daily 
comic strips 
Trudeau is in Nashville for the filming of Tanner 88 a 
twopart show that he wrote for Home Box Office 
This is much closer to what I do in the strip than if I were 
writing for a feature film this is anecdotal and episodic 
theres less of beginning middle and end Its openended like the 
strip Trudeau said Wednesday on a set of the show being 
directed by Robert Altman 
Tanner 88 follows the campaign of a Democratic candidate 
for president 
I was more interested in exploring the process of a modern 
campaign from a backstage point of view he said The candidate 
we put together is the one I felt most interested in writing for 
but I could just as easily have written a character from the 
right

about a Jewish boy who during World War II is hidden and
