A woman accused of killing a mental health 
caseworker and taking three people hostage at a hospitals 
psychiatric emergency room complained about mistreatment by 
doctors police said 
At an arraignment Wednesday where she was charged with homicide 
and reckless endangerment Edith Anderson 31 asked why she was 
being charged rather than her doctors 
Officers Peter Drummond and Robert White who talked with the 
woman during the siege said she claimed doctors gave her too much 
medicine 
She kept saying things like Martin Luther King is not dead 
and that she felt she had not been treated right by doctors at St 
Francis said White a former high school classmate of Ms 
Anderson 
It appears as though she has a mental history said police 
Chief Ralph Pampena 
Meanwhile the staff of St Francis Medical Center planned a 
memorial service for Monday for caseworker Linda Rosen 27 who was 
shot in the back Tuesday night as she tried to flee Miss Rosen had 
worked at the hospital since May 1986 
This is a nightmare Its the kind of thing psychiatric 
emergency room workers always worry about said Shirley Freyer 
spokeswoman for St Francis 
According to Ms Freyer Ms Anderson entered the emergency room 
at 855 pm and asked a security guard where she could get 
psychiatric help 
The woman told the guard Dan Sterzinger she wanted to think 
before registering as a patient and she sat in the waiting area 
Miss Rosen sat beside her and spoke briefly with her until Ms 
Anderson produced a gun Ms Freyer said 
The victim turned and ran and started yelling for security 
guards and at that point the suspect began shooting said police 
Commander Ronald Freeman 
Miss Rosen died where she fell doctors determined 
Ms Anderson then moved to a bathroom doorway and trained her 
gun on three people whom police declined to identify officials 
said 
I asked her to release one of the hostages but she said she 
was going to kill them Drummond said 
The woman wanted to speak to WPTTTV talk show host Eddie 
Edwards who went to the hospital but never spoke with her 
Drummond said he persuaded Ms Anderson to release a 26yearold 
woman among her hostages and White keeping his identity as a 
police officer secret sat with the two remaining captives 
I was really scared he said But the other two hostages 
were very well composed for such a stressful situation They kept 
looking at the television 
Ms Anderson asked for cigarettes and White slid a pack of 
across the floor toward her 
When she looked down on the floor at them I rushed her he 
said 
White slammed the door of the bathroom blocking Ms Andersons 
view of the hostages and Drummond and other officers blockaded the 
door and placed a bulletproof shield over it The woman then 
surrendered and was led screaming in a straitjacket to a police car
