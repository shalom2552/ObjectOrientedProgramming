Firecrackers dragon floats and even a banner 
reminding illegal aliens they can still seek amnesty were part of 
the celebration as thousands began ringing in the Chinese New Year 
over the weekend 
People jammed the streets of Chinatown on Saturday for a 
multiethnic celebration of the Chinese lunar year 4686 the year of 
the dragon although the year actually begins Wednesday 
A parade featuring beauty queens floats firecrackers and 
hundreds of people in colorful costumes wound through the streets 
Mixed with the traditional Chinese new year sounds of cymbals 
and gongs were musical notes from Scottish bagpipes and rhythms 
produced by Aztec drums 
Its just a cultural shock said Dan Olson of Escondido who 
attended the parade for the first time Its really interesting 
to see the different nationalities represented here 
During the parade a small plane flew overhead trailing a banner 
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that proclaimed 
Apply for Amnesty by May 4 
Dragons of all sizes and appearing in nearly every color 
pranced through the streets 
About 30 people from the First Testament Church gathered on the 
sidewalk to protest the appearance of the dragons arguing they 
were satanic symbols 
Many people are being deceived said Jeannie Lin With the 
year of the dragon Satan is trying to snatch the glory of God To 
them it might just be a celebration a parade but actually the 
dragon is of Satan 
Most people ignored the protesters 
The activities also continued into the evening with exhibits of 
martial arts traditional entertainment and crafts
