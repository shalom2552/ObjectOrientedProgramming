Three former police officers who pleaded guilty to 
federal corruption racketeering and cocaine trafficking charges 
were each sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison and 350000 in 
fines 
Armando Estrada 28 Roman Rodriguez 31 and Arturo De La Vega 
28 were among the original seven Miami police defendants whose 
first trial ended in a hung jury last year 
In all more than 70 of the departments 1033 officers have 
been arrested fired or suspended since the investigation of 
corruption began three years ago 
US District Judge Kenneth L Ryskamp told the three during the 
sentencing hearing that they shamed their entire profession during 
the sentencing hearing 
When I was a boy I thought a police officer must be the 
highest calling but young people today have the perception of a 
police officer as one who is corrupt he said 
Miami Police Chief Clarence Dickson however said the officers 
arrested do not reflect on the integrity of his department The 
majority of the men and women on the streets are honest upstanding 
cops 
A fourth defendant Ricardo Aleman who was convicted on 
narcotics and tax counts last year was given a delay in sentencing 
until Feb 26
