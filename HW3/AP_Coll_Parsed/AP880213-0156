When George Bush canceled an appearance at 
the last minute former Gov Hugh Gregg raised a copy of Bushs 
speech before the jilted audience and asked halfheartedly for a 
show of hands from those who wanted him to read it 
So few responded that he pocketed the papers and sat down 
Its like promising your wife Arpege and giving her Vigoral 
a vitamin tonic Gregg said 
But when the Arpege is spread too thin or being applied in 
other parts of the country candidates often apply a substitute in 
the form of movie stars members of Congress sports figures and 
local heroes to draw crowds and drum up support 
George Bush has Gov John Sununu and Rep Judd Gregg son of the 
former governor 
Jack Kemp has been getting a boost in person and in television 
ads from Sen Gordon Humphrey and Rep Robert Smith 
Bob Dole often has Sen Warren Rudman of GrammRudman and 
IranContra committee fame at his side accounting for the fourth 
and final member of an allGOP congressional delegation that has 
been working overtime in advance of Tuesdays 
earliestinthenation New Hampshire primary 
Rudman is so highly thought of that when Bush mentioned him 
during a nationally televised debate Dole quickly reminded the 
audienc that Dole not Bush is Rudmans candidate 
Kemp has brought football stars and television celebrity Chad 
Everett into the state 
Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis though a neighbor has 
called on Boston sports stars to represent him while he campaigns 
in other places 
Early in the campaigns surrogates are used to make phone calls 
and enlist party activists who fan out to help round up the rest of 
the troops 
I cant say how many people will vote for George Bush because 
John Sununu is supporting him but a lot of people who are working 
to see that George Bush wins the primary are working because John 
Sununu asked them to Bushs New Hampshire political director 
Will Abbott said 
When I do anything I stick my fingers in the pie said 
Sununu who has made phone calls walked in parades and even 
traveled to Iowa on Bushs behalf 
Kemps people say Humphrey and Smith are more valuable 
They are true grassroots conservatives and its the 
conservatives who turn out for Republican primaries Kemps state 
director Paul Young said 
Paul Jacobson Doles New England press secretary is one of 
several members of Rudmans staff on leave to help Doles 
presidential effort 
They and Rudman have a knowledge of New Hampshire and access 
to Rudmans campaign files 
You cant transfer popularity but you can eliminate 
legwork said Jacobson adding that Rudman can be used as a 
surrogate on almost the same level of credibility as Dole 
Rudman Humphrey and Sununu have been at odds holding news 
conferences to complain about the others candidates 
Sununu complained that Kemps tactics and ads have been 
stretching the fabric of the Republican Party Rudman said Kemp 
has been engaging the politics of fear and distortion that 
could cause major rifts in the party 
Humphrey complained that Bush and Dole are distorting their 
guncontrol records 
But they all say they will bury the hatchet when the primary is 
past 
This is an intramural contest You expect some bumping and 
jostling and thats good Thats healthy Humphrey said 
Sununu said Those guys are my good friends He said he and 
the senators and congressmen will keep tweaking each others 
tails during the final days of the campaign but afterward 
well have a big party
