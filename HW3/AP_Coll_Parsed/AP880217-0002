he said the investigation is continuing 
Donnelly was among 10 men charged Feb 9 with fraudulent trading 
in commodity futures The men were accused in four separate schemes 
one of which authorities said involved the use of wigs makeup 
and phony credentials to gain access to trading pits But Donnelly 
was involved only in the scheme to which he pleaded guilty Tuesday
