Bus drivers and mechanics overwhelmingly 
approved a contract proposal Friday night to end an 11day strike 
that had left 90000 daily riders without public transportation 
The board that runs the Queen City Metro transit system also 
approved the tentative agreement and hoped to restore bus service 
by Sunday morning 
Strikes are tough I hope we can mend those fences said 
Robert Baker president of the striking Local 627 of the 
Amalgamated Transit Union 
Negotiators concluded an allnight bargaining session Friday 
morning by announcing they had reached a compromise agreement The 
threeyear proposal gives the union greater job security and wage 
increases of about 5 percent the first year and 4 percent each of 
the two final years Baker said 
Baker said union leadership urged passage of the settlement 
which was approved at a union meeting by a 46540 margin 
The strike against the Queen City Metro transit agency began 
Feb 2 over wages and the companys proposal to use parttime 
employees to supplement regular workers during peak transit hours 
The union which represents about 750 bus drivers mechanics and 
clerks strongly objected to parttime employees in the belief they 
pose a threat to the jobs of fulltime employees 
A topscale bus driver made 1217 an hour under the old 
contract Queen City Metro says drivers were making about 30000 a 
year when routine overtime was figured in
