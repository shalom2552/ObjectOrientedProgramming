Oerlikon police spokesman Heinrich Laetsch told reporters 
Thirty people were in the restaurant when fire broke out he 
said

employees of the restaurant

the restaurant Rescuers feared at first the swimming pool located 
on the top floor of the 32floor highrise might collapse 
One fireman was hospitalized with respiratory complaints 
Witnesses said fire alarms at the hotel owned by the Swiss 
national airline Swissair sounded only after a delay 
An elevator reserved for the fire department failed to work so 
equipment had to be carried up the stairs local fire official Paul 
Berner said

employee apparently reponsible for the fire Police said he was in
