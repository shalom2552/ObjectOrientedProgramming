Secretary of State George P Shultz will go to 
the Middle East in two weeks to try to promote twostage 
negotiations between Israel and Jordan on Palestinian selfrule 
A brief State Department announcement Friday said Shultz would 
make the trip at the end of the month for the purpose of 
advancing the Middle East peace process 
Other US officials said he would set out for the Middle East 
about 24 hours after returning from Feb 2123 talks in Mosocw and 
visit Egypt Jordan Israel and possibly Saudi Arabia 
Shultz plans to remain in the area until he joins President 
Reagan for a summit meeting with the leaders of the 15 North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in Brussels beginning March 
2 
The Soviets have been notified in advance that Shultz intends to 
sound out Foreign Minister Eduard A Shevardnadze about an 
international peace conference that would be a backdrop for 
ArabIsraeli negotiations 
Their Moscow talks will center mostly on prospects for a treaty 
to sharply reduce US and Soviet longrange nuclear missiles and 
for a withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan after an 
occupation of more than eight years 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Shultz have registered 
their reluctance to having the Soviets play a prominent role in a 
Middle East settlement But Jordans King Hussein wants the 
participation of all the big powers including Moscow 
According to US and other sources who declined to be 
identified Shultz will advance a twostep plan that would open 
negotiations in April between Israel and a mixed 
JordanianPalestinian delegation and then resume in December to 
work on an overall Middle East settlement 
All options including statehood for the Palestinians would be 
open at that point 
Shultz reaffirmed Monday night in a meeting with American 
foreign policy experts that the US approach to a final settlement 
is based on Israel trading territory for peace 
That could cause severe political problems for Shamir because 
many of his supporters are against relinquishing land the Arabs 
lost to Israel in the 1967 SixDay War 
At the same time the United States has not endorsed Palestinian 
statehood President Reagans formula outlined in a 1982 speech 
and still US policy proposed linking the West Bank and Gaza to 
Jordan 
Reagan said flatly that the United States will not support the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the 
territories and would also not support annexation or permanent 
control by Israel 
Shultzs trip is designed to show a commitment to aiding the 15 
million Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza and 
to ending violence in the Israeliheld territories 
Sources said Shultzs overriding goal was to promote 
negotiations between Israel and the Arabs possibly in the 
framework of a Mideast peace conference 
They stressed that the framework was incidental to holding 
direct talks on the Palestinian issue and that all approaches to 
getting the two sides to the table would be considered 
The peace conference idea has drawn objections from Shamir but 
it has the support of Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and 
possibly King Hussein 
On his last visit to the region in October Shultz said he 
understood why Shamir would be reluctant to hold negotations in a 
way that gave the Soviet Union a chance to play an influential role 
The Soviets generally side with the Arabs in their dispute with 
Israel and do not have diplomatic relations with Jerusalem 
About 96 percent of the residents of the West Bank and Gaza are 
Palestinian Arabs Jewish settlers who were banned from the West 
Bank during Jordans control from 1948 to 1967 have established 
villages religious schools and synagogues there 
Hussein has accused the Reagan administration of being 
hopelessly onesided toward Israel But a recent US diplomatic 
emissary Philip C Habib was reported to have detected a 
positive attitude in talks with the king in Amman 
Assistant Secretary of State Richard W Murphy returned from the 
Middle East on Thursday and reported to Shultz on his meetings with 
leaders of Syria Saudia Arabia Egypt and Israel as well as with 
British and French officials
