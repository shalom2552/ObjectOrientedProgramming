Seven members of unofficial social and political 
groups demonstrated Saturday in a Moscow square against the 
governments attempts to restrict their activities one protester 
said 
The protesters held posters in Pushkin Square and spoke 
peacefully with about 150 passersby said Yevgenia Debryansky a 
member of the unofficial Group for Establishing Trust Between East 
and West 
In a telephone interview she said the demonstration continued 
unimpeded by militiamen for 15 minutes but that a KGB agent then 
ripped away one of the posters and the crowd dispersed 
The passersby were very interested in what we had to say and 
asked many questions Ms Debryansky said 
She said she and the other demonstrators were demanding that 
Soviet authorities let them in on discussions of any new laws that 
would restrict the activities of the unofficial groups that have 
sprung up under Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness on some social issues Rumors have been 
circulating that such laws are under consideration but their exact 
nature is unknown she said 
There have been other signs that authorities are cracking down 
on unofficial unsanctioned groups On Sept 1 the Moscow city 
council announced it would not allow protests near the Kremlin Red 
Square or on other squares in the citys center 
On Feb 1 the Communist Party newspaper published a lengthy 
article attacking what it called political freak organizations 
of the right and left Pravda said there are more than 30000 such 
groups nationwide 
On Dec 27 Pravda warned that unofficial groups would create 
anarchy by establishing alternatives to the Communist Party or 
official trade unions 
The statecontrolled publishing industry also is under orders 
not to print material prepared by groups lacking official 
recognition 
Ms Debryansky said the other groups taking part in Saturdays 
demonstration were Democracy and Humanism Perestroika 88 
Memorial and Freedom of Emigration for All
