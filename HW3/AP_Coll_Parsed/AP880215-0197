imagine such a thing even though I constantly warn commanders to 
expect the most awful things that could happen when soldiers find 
themselves all of a sudden commanding and deciding the lives of 
citizens

the elite Golani brigade were given jail terms of at least 21 days

Increasing signs of friction appeared between Israel and the 
United States over new American proposals for ArabIsraeli 
negotiations based trading territory for peace 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told a news conference before 
leaving for Italy he disagreed with a statement by Secretary of 
State George P Shultz made in a speech last week in Washington 
that negotiations must involve such a trade 
Thats not the principle that guides me said Shamir whose 
rightwing Likud bloc opposes the return of land Israel has 
occupied since the 1967 Middle East war 
Later in Rome Shamir defended his countrys policies in the 
occupied territories and blamed Arab countries for horrendous 
conditions in Palestinian refugee camps an Israeli spokesman said 
Shamir told President Francesco Cossiga the call for an 
international Middle East peace conference was not the best 
formula but said he is interested in the latest US peace 
initiative an Italian official said 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres who leads the centerleft Labor 
Party and is Shamirs rival in the coalition government 
recommended a joint LaborLikud approach to the US initiative 
I also proposed that we sit together he said It doesnt 
look so good when American envoys come and it seems that there are 
two governments Despite the differences of opinion we need to sit 
together
