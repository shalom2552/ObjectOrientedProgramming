Presidents Reagan and Miguel de la 
Madrid meet in this carnivalbedecked Pacific resort today to 
discuss how to increase trade in legal goods and reduce traffic of 
illegal drugs 
Reagan accompanied by Attorney General Edwin Meese Commerce 
Secretary C William Verity and Secretary of State George P 
Shultz will be in Mexico about four hours 
Reagan will have a meeting and lunch with de la Madrid in a 
luxurious seaside hotel within earshot of those celebrating the 
traditional Roman Catholic preLenten carnival 
It will be the sixth meeting between the two presidents who 
according to their aides have developed a good working personal 
relationship Both are in their last year in office 
Tight security measures by both countries have not interfered 
with the festival atmosphere of this port city of nearly 300000 
residents 
The leaders will be welcomed by the flags of both nations and 
bunting proclaiming Mazatlan a City of Friendship 
Verity Shultz and Meese will meet with their Mexican 
counterparts to discuss top matters of common concern trade 
foreign policy and the illegal drug trade 
Mexico struggling with a serious economic crisis now in its 
seventh year is making efforts to expand nonoil exports to the 
United States It also is trying to lower its own tariffs on US 
products 
The Mexicans however have made it clear they are not ready to 
join the United States and Canada in a North American free trade 
zone 
Unfortunately Mexicos most successful exports to the US 
market are those the two countries want to stop drugs 
Mexico has become a relay point for South American cocaine going 
to the United States and a major supplier of marijuana and heroin 
also shipped to the US market The state of Sinaloa of which 
Mazatlan is the secondlargest city is where much of the marijuana 
is produced in Mexico 
US officials have often criticized Mexican efforts to fight 
drugs as inefficient and hampered by official corruption 
Mexico counters that 60 percent of the budget of its federal 
Attorney Generals Office is used to fight drug traffic and 
complains the problem would not be as serious if there wasnt such 
a market for drugs in the United States 
Mexicos foreign policy often at odds with that of the United 
States especially when it comes to Central America will be a 
minor topic of discussion 
Neither one is going to change said a US source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
In the end trade will dominate the talks 
Mexico and the United States have worked out trade agreements 
dealing with steel textiles shoes and beer The presidents are 
expected to formalize some of those agreements during their meeting 
One US source said US companies would invest more in Mexico 
if it could make itself more attractive by offering flexible 
legislation when it comes to ownership Mexico generally demands 
majority stock in all joint ventures 
US investments in Mexico represent 2 percent of the total 
value of Mexicos industrial plant and equipment
