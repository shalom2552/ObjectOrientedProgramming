The nations labor leaders can look 
back on 1987 as the best year of a bleak decade But a tide of 
changing economic forces is still rolling against them 
Despite having regained some of the political and bargaining 
clout they lost in the early 1980s unions are continuing to lose 
members amidst the greatest peacetime spurt of job creation in the 
nations history 
Where they are the weakest is among women minorities and 
immigrants who will fill 85 percent of the new jobs created between 
now and the year 2000 according to projections by the governments 
Bureau of Labor Statistics 
A new 13 million AFLCIO media campaign following up on offers 
of lowinterest credit cards prepaid legal insurance and other 
lures aimed at potential whitecollar and pinkcollar recruits is 
still in its infancy 
The payoff is yet to be seen In absolute terms union 
membership among blacks and women increased by 9000 and 40000 
respectively last year But the percentage of nonunion workers in 
both groups also rose 
And despite the restoration of more than 300000 assembly line 
jobs in 1987 union membership among manufacturing workers 
organized labors biggest base of support for four decades 
declined by 178000 according to government figures 
Essentially unions in the past year have moved the ball out 
from what had been a goalline stance to the 7yard line says 
Richard Belous a labor market analyst for the Conference Board a 
business research house The bottom line is that they are still 
very much in the hole 
Nonetheless union chiefs on the AFLCIOs 36member 
policymaking executive council convening at this beachside resort 
for their annual winter meeting this weekend have reason to be 
optimistic for the first time this decade 
They have become a force again in both the economic and 
political arenas 
Unions last year succeeded in negotiating frontloaded contracts 
with the biggest wage gains and benefits coming early reversing a 
pattern of concessionary bargaining and endloaded contracts in the 
early 1980s 
With the exception of the meatpacking airline and steel 
industries unionized workers last year received roughly the same 
36 percent wage and benefit increases of nonunion workers 
enabling them to maintain a 36 percent overall wage advantage 
Divisive twotier contracts in which newly hired workers can 
never hope to catch up with veteran employees were still being 
signed in some industries like meatpacking 
But those split pay levels were eliminated or the wage gaps at 
least were greatly reduced among several other employer groups 
such as aerospace plants airlines and food stores 
And in exchange for productivity improvements from decreased 
featherbedding stronger job guarantees and new restrictions on 
subcontracting work to foreign or domestic nonunion suppliers were 
bargained in the auto mining and steel industries 
Those developments coupled with the reinvigoration of a 
legislative agenda dormant for the past eight years have AFLCIO 
President Lane Kirkland now speaking of the resurgent labor 
movement a term he was unwilling to adopt just a year ago 
As the 28 owners of the National Football League proved 
employers are still more than willing seven years later to follow 
President Reagans example with air traffic controllers and hire 
strikebreakers 
While the AFLCIO staked what some critics consider too many 
chips on the football players union and suffered a major symbolic 
loss with the failure of their strike it won several less visible 
but no less significant victories in other areas 
Seventy percent of the air traffic controllers hired to replace 
the 11000 strikers fired by Reagan in 1981 voted to form a new 
union And the Adolph Coors Co knuckled under to a decadeold 
boycott of its beer and agreed to allow unhindered union elections 
at its breweries and use union construction workers in building any 
new facilities 
Having played a key role in restoring the Senate to Democratic 
control in 1986 unions last year also dusted off a congressional 
agenda that had been shelved since 1980 
Only three months into 1987 the AFLCIO marshaled its allies in 
Congress to help override President Reagans veto of an 88 billion 
highway bill providing jobs for 700000 mostly union workers 
Through the summer and into the fall unions were instrumental 
in mounting grassroots opposition to President Reagans nomination 
of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court In October Borks 
confirmation was defeated on a 4258 vote 
Importcurbing trade bills the federations top legislative 
priority the past two years were passed by both the House and the 
Senate A measure requiring 60 days advance notice of layoffs was 
attached to the Senate version over intense opposition from the 
adminsitration and business lobbyists 
Kirkland expects this year will be even more active with 
passage expected on several other laborendorsed measures 
including raising the minimum wage restricting use of nonunion 
workers and mandating childcare leaves 
Veto override fights may become frequent and labor wont win 
them all Kirkland predicts But the veto battle will be part 
of the 1988 political campaign
