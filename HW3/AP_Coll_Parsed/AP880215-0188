US and Soviet negotiators on Monday discussed 
ways to test anticheating measures as they began a second round of 
talks on limiting nuclear test explosions 
Agreement on verification measures would permit ratification of 
two superpower treaties limiting the yield of test blasts 
The talks are due to last six to eight weeks 
The chief Soviet delegate Igor Palenykh said on arrival 
Saturday that the two sides are expected to agree on the dates and 
details of joint nuclear test explosions one in each country to 
be held by June 
Each side will demonstrate its detection technology in the 
experiments Palenykh said the tests will help the two sides agree 
preferably in the first half of 1988 on verification measures 
for the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful 
Nuclear Explosions Treaty 
Both pacts limit test explosions to 150 kilotons A kiloton 
equals the explosive force of 1000 tons of TNT 
The US Senate never ratified the pacts because of concerns 
they were unenforceable 
Palenykh said he hoped the two sides would agree on a 
combination of anticheating measures that would include both 
onsite detection which Washington favors and the remote 
monitoring system Moscow wants 
Washington has not set a deadline for agreement 
During the session preparations for the experiments will 
continue at the main Soviet test range at Semipalatinsk and the 
US site in the Nevada desert Palenykh said 
The round opened with a meeting at the US mission The US 
delegation is headed by Robert Barker 
At the first round in November the two sides agreed in 
principle to the joint tests 
Both sides agree the negotiations should eventually focus on 
reducing and ultimately banning nuclear tests
