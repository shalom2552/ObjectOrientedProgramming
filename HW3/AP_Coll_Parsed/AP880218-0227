Watching the frumpy middleaged wife of a 
provincial English vicar spiral out of control may not seem to be 
the ideal subject for what appears at first to be a domestic 
comedy 
But Alan Ayckbourns Woman in Mind which opened Wednesday 
at offBroadways Manhattan Theater Club is a very funny play It 
is also a dark disturbing one an unsettling look at someone 
slowly going mad 
What makes Woman in Mind special is its fractured 
oddangled look at the plays main character a dispirited dowdy 
housewife named Susan The woman is defeated by life and trapped in 
a marriage where she is not so much unloved as ignored 
The play could have been a dismal household harangue but 
Ayckbourn makes it decidedly unconventional He carries 
theatergoers into Susans psyche and its a harrowing journey 
A blow to the head from a garden rake sets Susan off on an 
escape into fantasy What Ayckbourn does is juggle reality and 
illusion in front of us while posing questions about happiness 
love and faith and what happens to a woman who has very little of 
each in her life 
Susans fantasies come alive in the form of a makebelieve 
family a husband brother and daughter who look and sound like 
they just stepped out of a Noel Coward comedy Drinking champagne 
and perpetually dressed for tennis the trio offers her relief from 
her unrelenting and uncaring world 
These people are the antitheses of Susans reallife husband and 
assorted relatives and friends The stuffy smug husband is more 
concerned about finishing a 600year history of the local parish 
than with his wifes mental collapse 
The woman must also endure a comic gorgon of a sisterinlaw 
whose ineptness as a cook sends guests fleeing in terror a 
wellmeaning but accidentprone doctor who develops a crush on her 
and an unforgiving son who returns home from the clutches of a 
bizarre sect where silence was not only golden but absolute 
Susan sorts out life in her garden a wonderfully verdant and 
deceptively tranquil oasis designed by John Lee Beatty She 
survives by withdrawing from her tormenters and just refuses to 
fight when her imaginary and real families battle over her soul 
Much of this is accomplished with high humor The playwright 
pricks the social moral and cultural conventions of a lower middle 
class where appearances count most Its the one thing Ayckbournes 
heroine cant keep up with 
Under Lynn Meadows sensitive direction Stockard Channing gives 
a compelling unsentimental performance as Ayckbourns haunted 
heroine Its a wideranging portrait capturing the characters 
acerbic humor as well as her everincreasing despair The actress 
almost unrecognizable is a lumpy vision of growing dementia She 
wears an unattractive flowerprint dress and her hair gives new 
meaning to the term dishwater blond 
Her two families are not of equal interest and the disparity 
shows in the performances Remak Ramsay is superbly selfabsorbed 
as the vicar and Patricia Conolly turns in a masterful job as the 
lethal cook and relentess sisterinlaw There is also a gentle 
lowkey and thoroughly ingratiating performance from Simon Jones as 
the wellmeaning doctor 
Susans fantasy family is not as well defined and such fine 
actors as Daniel Gerroll and Michael Countryman Susans idealized 
husband and brother must struggle to make them seem more than 
just comic devices 
To his credit Ayckbourn doesnt make Susan completely 
sympathetic but gives her several abusive tirades which 
demonstrate why her husband and son have turned away 
The playwright also keeps the audience offcenter and at arms 
length As Susan descends further and further into insanity 
Ayckbourn darkens the comedy The audience still laughs but its a 
nervous laughter born out of the bleakness of the situation 
Woman in Mind never forgets the humor in the horror a 
remarkable balancing act well worth seeing
