Adolfo Calero a leader of USbacked 
guerrillas in Nicaragua denied on Saturday that his troops trained 
in Panama or received funds from the Panamanian government 
We never had anyone training in Panama Calero said I 
dont know anything about it We have absolutely nothing to do with 
Panama nor with the Panamanian government 
We have never received any money from Panamanian sources he 
said 
Caleros comments in an interview after appealing to a 
convention of US conservatives to send donations to his cause 
was his first reaction to congressional testimony on Wednesday by a 
former top Panamanian intelligence officer Jose I Blandon 
Blandon told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that Panama 
provided military training for the rebels after a 1985 request from 
thenWhite House aide Oliver North At the time direct US 
assistance to the rebels was banned by law 
In addition Gen Manuel Antonio Noriega the Panamanian 
military leader whose ouster the Reagan administration is urging 
said last week that he and another former White House aide John 
Poindexter discussed the possibility of a US invasion of 
Nicaragua US government spokesmen have denied such talks took 
place 
Asked if he thought Noriega who was indicted last week by a 
grand jury on drug charges fabricated the story about invasion 
plans to divert attention from his current fight with the United 
States Calero replied Yes hes the one in hot water 
The testimony by Blandon and the comments by Noriega have raised 
several questions including Was the United States using Panama to 
help the Nicaraguan rebels at a time direct US assistance was 
outlawed 
Also at issue is the relationship between the United States and 
Noriega who has now been accused of criminality by a grand jury 
According to Blandons testimony the CIA gave Noriega classified 
reports on antiReagan administration senators 
The CIA denied the allegation but Sen Alfonse DAmato RNY 
said the fact of the matter is that it has been well know that 
Noriega the thug and racketeer has been on the payroll of the 
CIA for many years and remained there I am given to understand 
until rather recently 
In his speech to the annual Conservative Political Action 
Conference Calero lamented anew congressional rejection of an 
administration request for 362 million in aid for the Nicaraguan 
resistance 
He solicited private donations but said private support 
cannot substitute for US government aid 
However we do need private support of a humanitarian or 
nonlethal nature Calero said 
The Reagan administration whose solicitation of private funds 
for the Contras in previous years created a huge furor has 
publicized a White House memo ordering officials to take no part in 
private fund raising 
Calero said the vote against Contra aid will force the 
resistance forces to reduce their activities in the coming year 
but he added We will continue the struggle no matter what 
Opponents of the US government assistance said it would harm a 
peace plan signed by Nicaragua and other governments in the region
