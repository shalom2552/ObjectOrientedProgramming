The Soviet Union is unlikely to agree on a 
date for the next superpower summit meeting until the Senate 
ratifies a treaty to ban intermediaterange nuclear missiles a 
senior US official says 
I really think the Soviets probably would wait for the INF 
ratification the official said Wednesday Dont ask me why 
But I just sense its going to be important to them to have this 
process that was started by the signature at the Washington summit 
completed 
The official whose identity was shielded under briefing rules 
at the State Department referred to the Intermediaterange Nuclear 
Forces treaty to scrap about 2700 US and Soviet nuclear missiles 
It was signed by President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail 
S Gorbachev in December and is before the Senate for ratification 
In the meantime Secretary of State George P Shultz will hold 
talks in Moscow next Sunday and Monday on preparations for their 
next summit meeting It is to be held in Moscow possibly in late 
May or early June 
The centerpiece of that fourth and final meeting between the two 
leaders is supposed to be a more ambitious treaty to reduce by 30 
percent to 50 percent the overall US and Soviet arsenals of 
longrange bombers landbased missiles and submarines 
But the official said negotiations in Geneva had slowed down for 
several reasons The Soviets are trying to restrict Reagans 
Strategic Defense Initiative the program to develop a spacebased 
shield against ballistic missiles and the United States is 
resisting various restrictions on cruise missiles 
Shultz will meet on Sunday with Foreign Minister Eduard A 
Shevardnadze and on Monday with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze He is 
due to fly to Brussels on Tuesday to brief the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization allies on the results 
Meanwhile Charles E Redman the State Department spokesman 
announced Shultz also will meet with Andrei D Sakharov the noted 
Soviet dissident while he is in Moscow 
Human rights is high on his agenda Redman said Wednesday 
Mr Sakharov obviously is a person wellplaced to talk about 
these kind of issues 
Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L Ridgway in a US 
government telecast to Western Europe said human rights has 
pride of place in Shultz plans 
Other key items are the sloweddown negotations in Geneva to 
produce a new arms control agreement the prospective withdrawal of 
120000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan and US efforts to arrange 
ArabIsraeli negotiations 
Sakharov winner of the Nobel peace prize in 1975 is a 
physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s 
His subsequent outspoken support for human rights and opposition to 
the Afghanistan invasion led to his banishment to the closed city 
of Gorky in 1980 
He remained there until 1986 when he was permitted to return to 
Moscow amid Gorbachevs liberalization policy
