Daniel DayLewis orders most of the women he 
meets in his new film The Unbearable Lightness of Being to 
take off your clothes 
But in real life he says hes nothing like that 
I didnt go around bedding chambermaids he said in an 
interview in the Feb 22 issue of People magazine 
And despite the sexsymbol status the 30yearold Englishman is 
now enjoying he says hes mortified about the idea of all those 
people seeing me nude 
DayLewis son of the late English poetlaureate C DayLewis 
plays in his latest movie a lecherous Czech surgeon who chooses the 
heaviness of commitment over the lightness of freedom The 
movie is based on Milan Kunderas acclaimed 1984 novel of the same 
name 
DayLewis who won raves for his role as a gay street punk in 
My Beautiful Laundrette and as a Victorian gentleman in A 
Room With a View in 1986 says hes not worried about being 
typecast as a sex symbol 
If anything he says Im in danger of being typecast as a 
chameleon
