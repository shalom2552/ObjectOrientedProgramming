A top Pakistani official told Secretary of 
State George P Shultz his government attaches high priority to an 
Afghan peace settlement that includes replacement of the existing 
Sovietbacked regime in Kabul 
In a meeting Wednesday with Shultz Zain Noorani said peace and 
stability can return to Afghanistan if a proposed Soviet troop 
withdrawal is accompanied by the creation of an interim government 
that includes all component parties in Afghanistan including 
rebel forces 
The meeting took place against a background of Shultzs visit to 
the Soviet Union early next week to discuss Moscows plan for the 
withdrawal under certain conditions of Soviet troops from 
Afghanistan starting May 15 
Noorani minister of state for foreign affairs said there are a 
lot of similarities in the Pakistani and American positions on 
Afghanistan 
But in their past statements the two sides have indicated a 
difference of priorities 
The United States has emphasized the need for an early 
withdrawal of Soviet forces Pakistan has stressed the importance 
of an arrangement that will include both a Soviet withdrawal and 
the safe return of 3 million Pakistanbased Afghan refugees This 
stand was reiterated Wednesday by Noorani in his comments to 
reporters 
Pakistans insistence on the creation of a transition government 
in Kabul has drawn criticism from the Soviet Union which has 
accused Pakistan of obstructing an end to the war 
Noorani said the United States is not averse to the idea of 
establishing an interim government 
His visit is part of a flurry of diplomatic activity since 
Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev announced his plan last week for 
the withdrawal of the estimated 115000 Soviet troops 
He said that Moscow is prepared to start the pullout May 15 if 
Pakistan and Afghanistan agree to a United Nationssponsored 
agreement by March 15 The withdrawal would be phased over 10 
months 
Afghan and Pakistani authorities are scheduled to resume their 
talks through UN mediators on March 2 in Geneva 
Im confident that given a few days one way or the other it 
would be possible to have an agreement and an interim government 
both by the middle of March or the end of March Noorani said 
Pakistan is under heavy pressure to agree to Gorbachevs 
proposal A Pakistani rejection could leave it vulnerable to 
charges that it blocked the most promising initiative for the 
withdrawal of Soviet forces since they were sent to Afghanistan in 
December 1979 
But an Afghan guerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar said 
Wednesday it would be a historic blunder for Pakistan to sign 
an agreement to end the civil war if the present government in 
Kabul is not replaced
