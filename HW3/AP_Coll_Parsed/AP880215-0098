Vice President George Bush today predicted 
victory in the New Hampshire primary and said rival Bob Dole has 
fallen into the same momentum trap that snared Bush after the 
1980 Iowa caucuses Democrat Paul Simon told his supporters to look 
for a real surprise in the nations first primary 
I want New Hampshire to do what it did in 1980 when 
President Reagan turned around an Iowa defeat and beat Bush in the 
New Hampshire primary Bush said on ABCs Good Morning America 
In 1980 I came into New Hampshire talking momentum Reagan 
got the issues out And now its the opposite Bob Dole is talking 
momentum and Im talking issues Were doing better getting out 
those differences with Bob Dole on the issues 
On the eve of the nations first primary the Gallup 
organization released a poll showing Dole leading Bush in New 
Hampshire by a 3628 margin with Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson tied 
for third at 12 percent and Pete du Pont fifth with seven percent 
The poll of 589 likely Republican voters was conducted Friday and 
Saturday and had a fivepoint margin of error 
Other polls also showed the race a virtual tie with the vice 
presidents once substantial lead vanished into New Hampshires 
frigid air and the trend moving in the Kansas senators direction 
On the Democratic side Michael Dukakis remained the leader and 
the target of sniping by Richard Gephardt and Simon who are still 
dueling for second The Gallup poll of 424 Democrats showed Dukakis 
with 39 percent Gephardt 18 percent and Simon 16 percent Its 
margin of error was four points 
Simon campaigning in Hollis NH claimed the race is 
between Michael Dukakis and me and I think it is tightening I 
think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow 
Simon began television commercials attacking Dukakis the 
governor of nextdoor Massachusetts as a bureaucrat Gephardts 
new ads lashed at Dukakis too calling him one of the biggest 
taxraisers in Massachusetts history 
Dukakis ignored the criticism devoting much of Sunday to 
stating his views on foreign policy issues including Central 
America and nuclear arms control He emphasized his opposition to 
funding for the Nicaraguan Contras but said he would use military 
force if necessary to thwart a military attack on a Central 
American ally 
Bush cast himself as President Reagans strong loyalist in a 
debate with his five rivals Sunday night while Pat Robertson 
offered the startling assertion that the Soviet Union secretly has 
placed nuclear missiles in Cuba nukes pointing at the United 
States he said 
A White House official promptly disputed Robertsons claim and 
a Robertson aide said after the debate that the candidate had meant 
missiledelivery systems not necessarily warheads 
Dole displayed the confidence of a candidate who has seen all 
the breaks go his way for the past week since trouncing the vice 
president in the Iowa caucuses 
Some of us would like to see it end Tuesday here with someone 
winning Dole said He gently boasted later I have come a long 
way in the last 30 days 
Mindful that a secon loss after his Iowa debacle would be 
devastating Bush acknowledged his own shortcomings as a campaigner 
and made clear he didnt intend to give up no matter the outcome 
Tuesday 
He insisted he has no lack of passion and declared My 
work isnt done yet 
For Robertson the former television preacher the missiles 
remark was one of a series of attentiongetting statements over the 
past several days that provoked Jack Kemp to say in the debate 
He has said some offthewall things 
Robertson said in separate television interviews Sunday that he 
wouldnt have hesitated to kill Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 
and that he wants to gradually abolish the Social Security system 
over 40 years moving it into a private system 
Robertson failed to show up at a candidates forum held at a 
Jewish temple in Manchester where he had been scheduled to speak 
just after the debate His state campaign director David D 
Randlett told leaders of the Temple Adath Yeshurun that he didnt 
know why Robertson never showed up After hurried telephone calls 
Randlett said he couldnt find anyone with Robertson who could tell 
him 
Some 150 people had waited for an hour at the same temple where 
four years ago in an emotionpacked session Jesse Jackson tried to 
explain his embarrassing reference to New York as Hymietown 
Democratic darkhorse Bruce Babbitt arriving as scheduled 
ridiculed Robertson 
They told me he was too busy turning the next storm out to 
sea Babbitt said provoking laughter After talking for an hour 
Babbitt said Im willing to stay here till the sunrise whether 
it comes at the usual time or Pat Robertson makes it a little 
earlier 
Robertson the surprise secondplace finisher in Iowa was in a 
struggle with Kemp for third place in most New Hampshire polls His 
campaign manager Mark Nuttle said after the debate that Robertson 
had meant to say missile delivery systems not warheads were in 
Cuba He wouldnt give the source of his information other than 
that some of it had been compiled by the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee 
Outside the debate at St Anselm College about 25 Youth for 
Robertson students jeered at about 70 members of Cure AIDS 
Now a group that includes AIDS victims The Robertson backers 
chanted Its your own fault 
Republicans Kemp and Pete du Pont and Democrats Babbitt and 
Gary Hart all faced the prospect of having little choice but to 
drop out if they fall short Tuesday although du Pont and Hart 
vowed to go on in any event Third place seemed to be the line that 
determined the future for Kemp and du Pont 
In the GOP debate Kemp and du Pont both attacked Dole as 
harboring a secret desire to raise taxes Du Pont thrust a piece of 
paper in Doles face and asked him to sign a notaxincrease pledge 
while accusing him of pushing through higher taxes in the Senate 
That was to close loopholes on big companies like DuPont 
Dole said in sharp reply a reference to the giant corporation that 
was begun by du Ponts ancestors and is the source of his wealth 
The Democratic candidates held their final debate of the New 
Hampshire campaign on Saturday night with Gephardt drawing 
criticism from his rivals for changing positions on taxes and a 
range of other issues 
Albert Gore Jr asked for and got a televised apology from 
Gephardt for a profane denunciation of himself and his staff made 
by Gephardt campaign manager Bill Carrick earlier in the week 
Jesse Jackson boarded a 1930s train for a whistlestop tour 
through the Lakes Region of the state and drew hundreds at each 
stop despite 20degree temperatures and gusty winds 
Ive stood with you On Tuesday I want you to stand with me 
Jackson said from aboard his Rainbow Express
