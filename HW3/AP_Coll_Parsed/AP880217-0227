There are no medals when you come in sixth 
observed sixthplace New Hampshire finisher Bruce Babbitt on 
Wednesday Nor are there headlines or chunks of money coming in 
and by days end it looked as if he and Republican Pete du Pont 
were ready to call it quits 
We have drafted a statement said Babbitt It still has 
three conclusions to it and I have to check one of the boxes he 
said But the former Arizona governor conceded somebody would 
have to make a persuasive pitch to keep him in the race 
Babbitt scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning Du 
Pont who had not been heard from much after the New Hampshire 
primary scheduled one in the afternoon 
If you write a story that indicates were going to bow out 
youll be OK said a DuPont campaign source 
Only the presidential candidates named Bush Dole Dukakis and 
Gephardt didnt have to face questions about their steadfastness in 
the wake of the first primary A strong third in this contest 
wasnt good enough according to Sen Paul Simon DIll 
It makes a huge difference said Simon on NBCs Today 
show First of all in media momentum the headlines in the 
morning newspaper have his name rather than mine It makes a great 
deal of difference in money The he was Richard Gephardt who 
bested Simon 20 percent to 18 percent in the Democratic contest 
The winner of course was Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis 
whose finish in his neighboring state came as no surprise 
Simon said he has to win either the Minnesota caucus or the 
South Dakota primary next Tuesday to stay in 
I cannot continue to run second and third in various 
primaries he said You have to win somewhere And theres no 
sense in fooling myself or fooling those who follow me 
So Simon gave himself another week Babbitt said he was of 
divided mind on what to do 
I will indulge myself the luxury of agonizing no more than 24 
hours he said leaving New Hampshire for Washington My mood 
this morning is plaid There are no medals for sixth 
He planned to spend the day on the telephone What Im going 
to ask my frinds is you know Can I or should I throw it in and 
acknowledge reality 
One mans reality however was another mans vindication 
Sen Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee who didnt campaign as 
intensely as the other Democrats in New Hampshire looked forward 
to the Super Tuesday primaries next month when 1307 Democratic 
delegates will be picked in 20 states 
We made a decision not to spend 1 million on two or three 
delegates he said Were saving that for the 1400 delegates 
here in the Super Tuesday states He called the results in New 
Hampshire and last week in Iowa inconclusive 
Jesse Jackson who came in fourth in New Hampshire with 8 
percent of the vote said the two contests so far proved we could 
broaden our base 
Among white families he was asked by Kathleen Sullivan of ABCs 
Good Morning 
White families replied Jackson Weve found where that 
point of challenge is It is that at the plant gate which closed on 
workers without notice as in Kenosha Wis where theres a 
closure with too little notice or where farmers are losing their 
farms When they do that the lights are cut off and people look 
amazingly similar in the dark 
And Gary Hart last among seven Democrats with 4 percent took 
comfort in doing 500 percent better than Iowa where he barely 
got 1 percent 
We have just begun we are committed he said 
On the Republican side Jack Kemp saw his thirdplace finish as 
a victory in a race for conservatives among himself Pat 
Robertson and Pete du Pont The other race was one for the 
traditional moderate wing of the party between Vice President 
George Bush who won New Hampshire and Sen Bob Dole who came in 
second 
Finally weve dragged Bush and Dole out of discussing their 
resumes and their tax returns and where theyre born and into 
discussing issues Kemp said 
Du Pont returned home to Wilmington Del late last night and 
wasnt saying much publicly about his 10 percent of the vote and 
what it meant to his future as a presidential candidate His office 
said he was meeting with advisers presumably discussing that 
question 
Were solvent right now and we have enough money to run the 
campaign for another two weeks said du Pont press secretary Fred 
Stern 
For his part Robertson also was looking to Super Tuesday to 
overcome a 9 percent showing dead last in New Hampshire 
Theyre going to be playing in my backyard he said And 
addressing Bush and Dole the Virginiaborn Robertson said Im 
going to beat you there convincingly
