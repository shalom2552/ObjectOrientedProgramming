Former antitrust chief Douglas H Ginsburg 
dealt with 16 different cable industry matters while holding cable 
stock but either his role or his chance for personal gain was too 
small to violate federal conflictofinterest laws the Justice 
Department says 
The departments decision not to request appointment of an 
independent counsel for further investigation of the former Supreme 
Court nominee was detailed in a 116page report released Tuesday 
The report by Assistant Attorney General William F Weld head 
of the departments criminal division summarized the results of a 
threemonth inquiry in which Justice and FBI officials interviewed 
more than 50 people including Ginsburg 
Ginsburg did not return telephone calls seeking his reaction 
but his lawyers had joined the department in asking that the report 
be released to the public 
The report was released by the division of the US Circuit 
Court of Appeals here that appoints independent counsels to 
investigate alleged wrongdoing by high federal officials 
But the Justice Departments Office of Government Ethics says it 
wants to read the report before deciding whether to do or say 
anything about the case according to its general counsel Donald 
Campbell 
Separate from the criminal sanctions a presidential executive 
order prohibits actions that might give an appearance of conflict 
The penalty for violating this is administrative discipline 
But Ginsburg has since become a member of the judicial branch 
sitting on the US Court of Appeals here All the ethics office or 
any other executive branch agency could do now is issue a letter or 
reprimand for a former employee 
Weld said the department conducted a preliminary inquiry into 
three matters that had been reported in news accounts In addition 
department investigators came up with 13 other instances of 
Ginsburgs involvement in cable issues but Weld said these did not 
even merit a preliminary inquiry 
Ginsburg withdrew from consideration as a Supreme Court justice 
last November after he acknowledged that he had smoked marijuana 
while a professor at Harvard Law School 
The investigation covered a period from 1983 to 1986 in which he 
was either assistant attorney general in charge of Justices 
antitrust division or a deputy to the chief 
During this period his only substantial stock holding was about 
140000 worth of Rogers Communications Inc a Canadianbased 
cable operator which is also among the top 15 US cable operators 
The news reports about the cable dealings triggered the Justice 
inquiry that began last November and was concluded with the Feb 6 
report released Tuesday The marijuana use was not a subject in the 
inquiry because no federal laws were violated 
In one of the newly disclosed instances Weld concluded that 
Ginsburgs stock in Rogers Communications Inc might have risen in 
value as a result of Ginsburgs participation in a copyright 
infringement case before the Supreme Court 
He said Ginsburgs participation including ordering a brief 
opposing Supreme Court review of the case and editing an early 
draft was substantial as required by the conflictofinterest laws 
And Weld said that case might have relieved Rogers of paying 
some fees for transmitting copyright programs over its cable 
systems Judge Ginsburg through his ownership of class B shares 
of RCI may have had an interest in RCIs no longer paying the 
transmission fee Weld wrote 
But Weld added that any such interest would be remote direct 
and infinitesimal In addition he said Ginsburg did not appear 
to be aware of his financial interest 
In one case in which the department did conduct a preliminary 
inquiry Weld concluded that Ginsburg participated personally and 
substantially in a friendofthecourt brief to the Supreme Court 
In that case the high court for the first time extended First 
Amendment protection to cable operators 
But Weld said officials questioned by the department differed on 
whether and how much Rogers would be helped or hurt by this ruling 
In two previously reported matters involving comments filed by 
the antitrust division with the Federal Communications Commission 
Weld concluded that Ginsburgs role was tangential and 
unimportant in one case and insubstantial in the other 
Weld handled the matter as acting attorney general because 
Attorney General Edwin Meese III and four other more senior Justice 
Department officials decided to take no part in the case
