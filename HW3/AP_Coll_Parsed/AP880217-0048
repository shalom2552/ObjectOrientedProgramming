A federal appeals court says Japanese salmon 
fishermen who accidentally catch seals killer whales and other 
mammals are violating an animal protection law 
The US Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday upheld a preliminary 
injunction issued by a federal district judge last June that 
revoked a permit and halted gillnet fishing for salmon by Japanese 
fleets in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska 
In a 21 decision a threejudge panel rejected an appeal by the 
Federation of Japan Fisheries Cooperative Association to overturn 
the preliminary injunction issued by US District Judge Norma 
Holloway Johnson 
The injunction was obtained by an environmental group and a 
native Alaskan fishermans organization to stop the accidental 
taking of sea lions fur seals white porpoises and killer whales 
that could be ensnared in the ninemilelong gillnets 
As issued by the secretary of commerce the threeyear permit 
would have allowed the Japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5250 
Dalls porpoises in the northern Pacific Ocean including 789 in 
the Bering Sea 
The court ruled that the permit which allowed the Japanese 
fishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took 
violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia says 
there isnt enough give and take at the private conferences the 
justices hold to review appeals and vote on pending cases 
Scalia the newest sitting justice in an address at the George 
Washington University Law School said calling what the justices do 
a conference is a misnomer 
Not very much conferencing goes on Scalia said I dont 
like that Maybe its because Im new or an exacademic maybe 
because I am right 
Scalia said the primary purposes of the conferences are to 
provide an opportunity for the justices to state their views on 
cases and to tally up their votes 
The conferences are held weekly when the court is in session 
Only the members of the court attend the closeddoor meetings in 
which they decide whether to hear particular appeals and make final 
decisions on cases in which they have heard arguments 
Scalia became a justice in 1986 and will be joined by on the 
court by Anthony M Kennedy who will be sworn in Thursday as the 
ninth member filling a vacancy created when Justice Lewis F 
Powell retired last June

A federal appeals court has ruled the Humane 
Society has legal standing to challenge the expansion of hunting on 
federal wildlife preserves 
A threejudge panel of the US Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday 
overturned a district judges finding that the Humane Society of 
the United States lacked the requisite legal standing to sue the 
Interior Department to stop hunting on nine federal wildlife 
preserves 
The gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting on 
wildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpses 
and environmental degradation in addition to depleting the supply 
of animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view the court 
said in an opinion written by Chief Judge Patricia Wald 
David J Hayes a Washington attorney who represented the Humane 
Society called the decision significant because it confirms that 
environmental groups like the Humane Society have the right to 
bring actions based on their members concerns about harms to their 
aesthetic interests 
While ruling the society had a legal right to sue the court 
upheld the Interior Departments decision to allow waterfowl 
hunting on Chincoteague Island Va 
The appeals court decision sends a district court case back to 
District Judge Thomas A Flanneryfor a ruling on the merits of the 
Humane Societys claims that the Interior Department had not 
properly evaluated the wildlife populations of other preserves 
before allowing hunting

Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger 
questions whether fundamental policy changes are taking place in 
the Soviet Union and whether Mikhail Gorbachev can keep his post as 
top leader 
I think we have to be very careful if we assume there are 
major policy changes Weinberger said I dont know how 
firmly seated is the present regime I dont think any of us really 
know that 
Im not sure anybody would be allowed to be general secretary 
of the Communist party of the Soviet Union who is very different 
from the past Weinberger told the Washington Foreign 
Correspondents Association Tuesday 
Weinberger who was succeeded by Defense Secetary Frank Carlucci 
late last year described as surface changes the new look at 
the Kremlin Gorbachev smiles from time to time he wears much 
better clothes and hes younger and apparently in better health 
than past leaders he said 
The principal change I see in the Soviet Union is that they 
are now actively courting world public opinion campaigning for a 
favorable world press and this is so new and so novel that they are 
getting it he said
