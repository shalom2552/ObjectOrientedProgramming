President Reagan said today he and Mexicos 
President Miguel de la Madrid would act to strengthen the 
commercial ties between our peoples as they held their sixth 
summit meeting in six years 
In his weekly radio address prerecorded in Washington and 
released here before the presidents departure for todays meeting 
in Mazatlan Mexico Reagan said commercial ties between the two 
countries are of great benefit to people on both sides of the 
border 
Weve worked hard to make it that way he said Last 
November we signed a new framework of understanding that 
underscored our special trade and investment relationship 
During our meetings in Mazatlan President de la Madrid and I 
will reaffirm our commitment to take advantage of every opportunity 
to strengthen the commercial ties between our peoples 
The United States is Mexicos largest trading partner Mexico is 
the fourth largest trading partner of the United States behind 
Canada Japan and West Germany 
Although putting the emphasis on trade Reagan also touched in 
his radio address on two subjects the war on drugs and guerrilla 
warfare in Central America over which the two countries have 
sharp differences 
The traffickers would go out of business if people quit buying 
illegal drugs the president said Thats the real solution 
and its up to each and every one of us to be part of the 
solution 
US officials have said that Mexico does not do enough to 
combat the drug trade and Mexican officials in turn have argued 
that the United State should act more aggressively to curb demand 
Turning to Central America the president said that the 
establishment of totalitarian regimes supported by Cuba and the 
Soviet Union is a threat to stability and freedom in the region 
I would hope that the United States and Mexico will find common 
interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat he said 
Mexico has opposed the US policy of aiding rebels fighting the 
Marxistled government of Nicaragua 
Reagan also said that the United States will continue to do 
our best to help find solutions to the vexing problems of Mexicos 
international debt 
Mexico owes approximately 80 billion to commercial banks and 
the Treasury Department announced in December it would be selling 
the Mexican government up to 10 billion in special US bonds to 
be used as collateral to help pay off the debt 
Reagan said Friday he and de la Madrid would sign a new 
fouryear textile accord during their meeting at the Mexican port 
The Washingtonbased Council on Hemispheric Affairs in an 
analysis released in advance of todays meeting said it would be 
difficult for the two countries to achieve an agreement similar to 
the one negotiated last year between the United States and Canada 
The reason it said is that the MexicanUS border marks the 
only such line in the Western world where a remarkably rich market 
confronts a remarkably poor one 
Reagan long an advocate of a North American Common Market on 
Jan 2 signed a USCanadian agreement negotiated last year that 
would eliminate all tariffs and most other trade barriers between 
the two countries by 1999 
Mexico and the United States have however worked out trade 
agreements dealing with steel textiles shoes and beer
