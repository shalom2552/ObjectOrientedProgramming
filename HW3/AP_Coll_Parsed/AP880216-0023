New Hampshire primary voters put their 
often unpredictable mark on the 1988 presidential campaign today 
with Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis hoping for a neighborly 
boost from the Democrats On the Republican side Bob Dole hoped to 
make it two victories in a row while George Bush banked on a 
comeback 
In keeping with longstanding tradition the 34 voters of 
Dixville Notch cast their ballots shortly after midnight at the 
Balsams a resort hotel and gave the edge to Bush and Democrat 
Richard Gephardt 
Statewide about 150000 Republicans and 115000 Democrats were 
expected to vote according to William Gardner secretary of state 
It feels good like it did in Iowa last Monday said Dole 
referring to the Iowa caucus victory that catapulted him to the 
forefront of the race 
But Bush who suffered a jolting setback in Iowa predicted hed 
bounce back in New Hampshire 
I sense a rising tide the vice president said 
Bush took some comfort from New Hampshires tradition of 
rejecting Iowa winners including Bush in 1980 and Walter F 
Mondale in 1984 
All the candidates seven Democrats and five Republicans 
sounded upbeat about their prospects Optimism was bipartisan 
I hope we are going to do a good deal better than people are 
expecting said Democratic Sen Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee who 
was dead last in Iowa after pulling his campaign out of the state 
last year 
Pat Robertson who finished ahead of Bush in Iowa was in a 
tight battle for third place in the GOP primary with Rep Jack Kemp 
and former Gov Pete du Pont of Delaware 
I dont know where all those political pundits are today but 
they ran for cover four years ago and theyre likely to run for 
cover tomorrow said du Pont 
Kemp insisted he too would fool the pollsters Im going to 
finish in a good competitive third or higher he said 
Robertson hinted he might equal his Iowa showing and come in 
second The former television evangelists finish in Iowa was far 
stronger than the polls had indicated so no one was willing to 
predict how large his New Hampshire following might be 
Robertson was trying to distance himself from statements made in 
a debate Sunday night when he said there were Soviet nuclear 
missiles in Cuba That drew a quick denial from the White House and 
criticism from the rest of the GOP field 
He initially stuck by the statement on Monday but under 
questioning acknowledged he had no firsthand evidence that there 
were nuclear missiles on the island 
Democratic Sen Paul Simon of Illinois said he was sure hed 
defeat Gephardt the Missouri congressman for second place And 
referring to Dukakis commanding lead in the polls he said I 
think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow 
As it has since 1960 the mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch was 
the first to report results On the Republican side Bush received 
11 votes Dole had six Kemp five du Pont two Alexander Haig two 
and Pat Robertson one 
The towns seven Democratic voters gave Gephardt four votes and 
Simon three 
I dont think it makes any difference if youre the first vote 
or the last Its the vote that counts the privilege said Neil 
Tillotson 89 town moderator and the communitys patriarch who 
traditionally casts the first ballot just after midnight 
Gephardt was the Democratic winner in Iowa and Simon finished 
second and Dukakis third in the caucuses there But statewide 
results in New Hampshire were likely to be different 
Dukakis was the overwhelming favorite with Simon and Gephardt 
battling for second 
Opinion polls consistently gave Dukakis the support of between 
36 and 40 percent of Democrats 
Polls of New Hampshire Republicans showed a dramatic impact of 
the Iowa results Bush once the choice of 52 percent of the 
states Republicans entered primary day in a virtual dead heat 
with Dole 
Six candidates appeared at the Mall of New Hampshire in 
Manchester on Monday for a Rally Finale and a chance to pick up 
support among the thousands of holiday shoppers 
From a platform set up between a shoe store and a jewelery shop 
Republicans Kemp and du Pont and Democrats Gore Simon former Gov 
Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and Jesse Jackson delivered abbreviated 
versions of their stock stump speeches 
Leadership was a campaign theme sounded in both Iowa and New 
Hampshire particularly in the struggle between Bush and Dole But 
the foreign policy debate on the Republican side featured more 
hawkish rhetoric in New Hampshire than in dovish Iowa 
Dole who rarely mentioned Star Wars in Iowa made a strong plea 
in New Hampshire for development and deployment of the missile 
defense system 
Candidates in both parties also emphasized their fealty to low 
taxes an article of political faith in New Hampshire 
Bush who brought in a corps of congressmen to campaign for him 
on the weekend trumpeted the endorsement of former Sen Barry 
Goldwater of Arizona in a television commercial Monday 
Goldwater the 1964 GOP presidential nominee and a hero to 
conservatives called Bush the best qualified candidate of my 
lifetime other than me
