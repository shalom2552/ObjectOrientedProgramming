With a Beretta pistol in 
her lap Tzip Haetzni pulled her car out of this hilltop community 
and joined a convoy of Jewish settlers on patrol under the stars 
Her husband Eliakim an attorney sat beside her also armed 
After nine weeks of unrest in the occupied territories and two 
serious attacks on Jewish settlers residents of Kiryat Arba 20 
miles south of Jerusalem have begun nightly patrols 
We shall not be chased from this place Haetzni 62 vowed 
as his wife steered the car past an Arab refugee camp We shall 
meet the danger We will fight darkness by lighting up the night 
But these tactics while carried out by only a minority of the 
West Banks 65000 Jewish settlers have triggered panic and 
sometimes fueled new violence 
In the Arab village of Beit Ummar this week a report of 
approaching settlers sounded from a mosque loudspeaker It was a 
false report but hundreds of Palestinians fearing a vigilante 
attack rushed to the village outskirts armed with sticks and 
stones 
Israeli soldiers who knew nothing of the false report tried to 
force the Arabs back Three villagers were killed in the clash the 
army said 
In other Arab towns and refugee camps Palestinians patrol their 
neighborhoods through the night looking for vigilantes 
The Arab inciters have begun shouting The settlers are 
coming The settlers are coming to get everyone stirred up 
said Mrs Haetzni 60 
But the rumors are false she said We want to make our 
presence felt on the road We want the Arabs to know we are here 
But most of us are happy to let the army do the fighting 
Nevertheless Kiryat Arba residents say some of their men 
entered the nearby village o Hebron one night and smashed windows 
of Arabowned cars Some settlers have also distributed leaflets in 
Arab villages threatening retaliation against inciters of violence 
Still the relationship between most Israeli soldiers and 
settlers is better than ever 
With more than 100 troops stationed roundtheclock along the 
road from Kiryat Arba to Jerusalem and a spotlight sweeping 
continuously over a nearby refugee camp many settlers feel the 
army is finally doing its job 
Before it was like a toy army here so we had to protect 
ourselves Haetzni said We never would have reached this stage 
if the army had been stronger earlier But at least they are acting 
now 
In an effort to help cement their new relationship the 
settlers threecar convoy took coffee cake and sunflower seeds to 
troops guarding the road overnight 
The convoy stopped outside the nearby village of Beit Ummar a 
closed military area where two dozen soldiers stood outside a 
Palestinian home while Arab children peered from the window above 
One soldier wore a checkered Arab headdress wrapped around his 
face for warmth 
Pvt Rafi who would give only his first name in keeping with 
military regulations said the army has warmed to the presence of 
the settlers in the area 
We dont mind if they patrol the roads he said We and 
they are the same people even if we dont always see eyetoeye 
politically 
Not all Israelis agree Some say the settlers are a source of 
provocation not protection Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has 
called them a heavy burden 
The appearance of armed settler patrols alongside Israeli army 
forces creates the impression that the state of Israel is 
encouraging Jews in a war against the Arabs the daily Haaretz 
wrote this week 
The Israeli army does not operate according to Jewish tribal 
feelings and the farther it distances itself from the settlers 
the better 
But Haetzni argues Those Israelis who dont understand our 
presence here also dont understand the Arab mentality 
Haetzni came to Israel from Germany at the age of 13 He built a 
lucrative law practice in Tel Aviv and then gave it up to move to 
Kiryat Arab 16 years ago 
He recalls being beaten up as a boy in Germany because he was 
Jewish and says it helped make me a better more realistic 
Zionist today 
What Israelis dont realize is the Arabs do not want a state 
on this side of the green line he said referring to the 
pre1967 border of Israel They want a state that extends all the 
way to the blue line the Mediterranean Sea
