The Soviet Union has started dismantling some of 
its missiles in East Germany although a superpower treaty scrapping 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles has not been ratified a news 
agency reported 
ADN East Germanys staterun news agency said missiles 
stationed in Waren 20 miles west of Neubrandenburg have been 
taken apart put in crates and are ready for transport back to the 
Soviet Union 
With this step we can make an important contribution toward 
disarmament even before the treaty between the United States and 
the Soviet Union is ratified ADN said Tuesday night 
The Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland today 
printed a frontpage report on the preparations for early removal 
of the missiles Neubrandenburg is north of Berlin 
Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR East 
Germany Troops in Waren dismantle rockets earlier than 
expected Neues Deutschland New Germany said in a headline to 
its story 
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev signed 
the treaty in Washington last December agreeing to eliminate all 
landbased medium and shorterrange missiles 
The agreement stipulates that the Soviets shorterrange 
missiles in East Germany and in Czechoslovakia are to be removed 
within 18 months and mediumrange US and Soviet missiles within 
three years 
The Senate has not ratified the treaty The Supreme Soviet the 
Soviet Unions parliament is expected to approve the accord 
In Washington the State Department had no immediate reaction to 
the report 
A US official however said the Soviets were free to take 
down their missiles before the treaty takes effect The official 
who demanded anonymity said US inspectors will go to East 
Germany and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the Soviets 
were complying with the treaty if it is ratified 
Although there was no comment in Moscow on the reported 
dismantling Gorbachev on Tuesday criticized Western European 
countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the 
superpower treaty 
The official Tass news agency quoted Gorbachev as criticizing 
Western European governments for the latest wave of praise for 
the nuclear deterrence strategy all manner of projects for 
the joint manufacture of newest weapons the FrancoWest German 
military rapprochement and so forth 
West German government officials declined comment on the report 
Tuesday night It is too early for us to comment at this time 
a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
The Associated Press 
ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when 
they would be returned to the Soviet Union only that Soviet 
soldiers are making the last preparations to return their SS12 
rockets 
The rockets are shorterrange weapons included in the 
intermediaterange missile treaty which bans weapons with a range 
of 300 miles to 3000 miles 
East German television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading 
missile crates onto transport vehicles 
ADN quoted a Soviet military officer as saying the troops are 
very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit The 
rockets are to be sent back to the Soviet Union by train ADN said 
It said East German journalists who toured the missile base were 
allowed to interview Soviet soldiers 
Erich Honecker the East German leader indicated in January 
that Soviet intermediaterange rockets stationed in East Germany 
could be removed ahead of schedule but he gave no specific 
timetable 
According to figures released after the treaty was signed 22 
rockets 12 launchers nine transport vehicles and seven practice 
missiles were stationed at the Neubrandenburg site which holds the 
largest numbers of SS12s in East Germany There are three other 
SS12 rocket sites in East Germany 
In all there are 54 SS12s in East Germany according to those 
figures 
The Soviet Union also has 53 SS23 shorterrange nuclear rockets 
in East Germany
