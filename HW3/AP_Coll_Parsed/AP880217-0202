A leukemia victims longlost brother has rejected 
pleas to determine whether his bone marrow is compatible dashing 
the patients best hope for survival 
If he dies he dies Hes about as much a brother to me as you 
are Randy Jeff Chapman told a reporter for The Miami News 
Chapman 31 ran away from home when he was 17 and lives on the 
streets here working as a test subject for medical experiments He 
refused to undergo tests that would check if he could donate marrow 
to his brother Steve Chapman 38 of Oolitic Ind Chapman has 
another brother and sister who have already been tested and found 
incompatible 
The older brother suffers from acute leukemia and said he will 
die within two years unless a marrow transplant succeeds He is now 
receiving blood transfusions and chemotherapy at St Vincents 
Hospital in Indianapolis 
While his leukemia is in remission his doctor said a marrow 
transplant should be performed within four months 
After reading an earlier News article about Steve Chapmans 
efforts to locate his brother in Miami a friend of the younger 
Chapman called the newspaper and told them Chapmans whereabouts 
A reporter found Chapman at the downtown Dade County Public 
Library Tuesday 
Im not even going to consider it he said of the marrow 
donation request If I sound cruel well thats the way I feel 
Im not a very forgiving person 
He said testing to see if his marrow is compatible with his 
brothers might interfere with a drug experiment in which he is 
going to participate starting Monday at the University of Miami 
Thats how I make my living he said 
Contacted at his hospital room Steve Chapman said his brothers 
decision disappointed him 
He must have turned into a hard person he said I guess 
thats what living on the street does to you I thought he would at 
least try to help but thats the way things go
