Representatives of 150 black students 
occupying a building at the University of Massachusetts refused to 
meet with the chancellor today saying they would sit in the 
building until their demands are met 
It has become obvious to us that you are not being 
reasonable said sophomore Mark CodlingDave a spokesman for the 
students who took over the New Africa House on Friday 
As far as we are concerned we have nothing else to say he 
added 
The students demands included prosecution of white students who 
allegedly beat two black students and a white woman last weekend 
suspension of white campus police accused of forcing blacks into a 
lineup and removal of classrooms to return New Africa House to its 
former use as a cultural center for the black community 
Chancellor Joseph Duffey said after the students refused to meet 
with him that he planned to go home and wait for the protesters to 
call him Obviously we have to talk he said 
University spokeswoman Jeanne HopkinsStover said earlier that 
the protesters had agreed to meet with the chancellor today 
Duffey said he regretted the lineup by the campus officers and 
had ordered them not to do it again He said however that 
prosecution of the alleged assailants was a matter for the courts 
He also said there was too little space on campus to move 
classrooms out of the New Africa House My first responsibility 
here is education and this building is committed to education in a 
range of ways Im not about to put black AfroAmerican professors 
out of this building 
Duffey said he planned no reprisals against the protesters 
Theyre not disrupting anything and I dont think they intend 
to he added 
Dwayne Warren a student serving as liaison between Duffey and 
the protesters estimated that up to 150 students spent the night 
in the building 
Blacks at the 25000student university say an undercurrent of 
racism has not abated since Oct 27 1986 when blacks and whites 
clashed following the Boston Red Sox loss to the New York Mets in 
the final game of the World Series 
Two black students and the white girlfriend of one of the men 
filed complaints earlier this week against six white men alleging 
civil rights violations and assault and battery stemming from an 
attack last weekend 
The chancellor issued a statement condemning the alleged attack 
after a delegation of black students presented their demands Friday 
The demands included the expulsion of the accused whites and 
the suspension of white campus police officers who apparently 
ordered a lineup of seven black men at a dorm early Feb 6 after a 
white student complained of being harassed by a black man 
Duffeys statement said two of the students allegedly involved 
in the beatings have been ordered to move out of the schools 
residence halls All five face disciplinary hearings within the 
next two weeks 
It should be clear once again that the university will not 
tolerate physical abuse or racially associated attacks on others 
his statement said Saying He started it or She started it is 
not an excuse 
A court hearing is scheduled Feb 24 to determine whether there 
is enough evidence to charge the men accused of the weekend 
beatings 
The chancellor issued a separate report to the head of campus 
police asking him to cease lineups in the future 
The activity was most inappropriate especially in this 
particular instance because only minority students were required to 
line up for possible identification the report said 
One of the three men in the lineup was arrested on an 
outstanding warrant and two others were banned from campus for 
trespassing Ms HopkinsStover said 
About 7 percent of the students at the school are black
