Home prices skyrocketed in many Northeastern 
cities last year propelled by that regions prosperous economy 
while prices were falling in depressed farm and energy regions 
according to a survey by a real estate trade group 
The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that prices on 
existing homes rose 51 percent to a national average of 84300 at 
the close of last year slightly ahead of consumer inflation which 
was up 44 percent in 1987 
But the nationwide average masked widespread geographic 
differences Home prices shot up 322 percent in Providence RI 
six times the national average Three other Eastern cities Albany 
NY Hartford Conn and Washington also saw home prices climb 
by 18 percent or more 
But the association said its survey of 53 metropolitan areas 
found 14 cities where prices fell during the year This list was 
dominated by areas dependent on farming and energy industries 
Houston suffered the biggest price decline a drop of 72 
percent followed by declines of 56 percent in Oklahoma City and 
55 percent in Des Moines Des Moines was ranked as the most 
affordable place to buy a home last year with a median price of 
52000 
At the top of the price scale were New York City with a 
midpoint price of 180800 and Boston with a selling price of 
178600 at the end of last year These two cities have held the 
top two price positions for the past two years 
Despite volatile mortgage rates and the October collapse of the 
stock market home sales remained near eightyear highs last year 
Sales totaled 3885 million units in 1987 down a tiny 03 percent 
from 1986 Both years represented the fastest sales pace since 405 
million homes were sold in 1979 
Alaska and Louisiana two states which had suffered a big slump 
in sales because of depressed energy industries enjoyed a rebound 
last year leading the country along with Massachusetts with the 
largest percentage gains 
Sales in Alaska rose 262 percent and were up 188 percent in 
Louisiana and Massachusetts Twentytwo states had sales increases 
last year 
Others enjoying big gains were Georgia with an 185 percent 
increase and North Dakota and Maine with advances of 179 percent 
and 143 percent respectively 
The Northeast continues as the strongest region but we saw 
considerable strength in the South and Midwest two areas which had 
been lagging the rest of the country said John Tuccillo chief 
economist for the realtors group 
Twentytwo states suffered sales declines last year led by a 
138 percent drop in Washington state a decline which erased a 
155 percent gain of the previous year Sales fell 133 percent in 
Virginia followed by declines of 97 percent in both Maryland and 
Oklahoma 
Analysts said that one factor which pushed up 1986 sales was a 
lastminute rush to close sales and reap capital gains profits 
before the new tax law took effect on Jan 1 1987 
Tuccillo predicted that price increases nationwide should be 
lower than the 51 percent rise in 1987 with sales expected to 
decline by around 8 percent in part because of slower economic 
growth 
Tuccillo predicted that the Northeast will continue to have the 
highest home prices of any region but he said the rate of increase 
should slow 
A leveling off is occurring after a long period of overheated 
activity he said The losses incurred by those in the New York 
financial community are still having a lagging effect on home 
buying in that area
