A supermarket found a novel way to 
help celebrate this citys centennial a 100second mad dash 
through the aisles for free groceries and other items 
Seven runners each representing a city resident who is at least 
100 years old racked up 97551 worth of items Saturday according 
to store manager Paco Preciado Most of the competitors were the 
centenarians grandchildren he said 
About 50 regular shoppers cheered and Preciado kept a close eye 
on the stopwatch as the racers made individual dashes through the 
aisles 
When it got down to 10 seconds it was like pandemonium for 
the person shopping Preciado said 
One woman managed to cram 289 worth of goods in her cart 
She was running a lot of meat a lot of soaps highfigure 
items he said 
Other favorites were ice cream and frozen foods 
The centenarians wearing special Tshirts watched the 
goingson Preciado said 
They looked like they were enjoying themselves he said 
When youre 100 years old you dont jump up and down

Instead of calling the witness to the stand Judge 
Robert Fullerton asked him to please step over to the telephone 
speaker 
Fullerton who wore no judicial robes was conducting an 
experiment in trying a case by conference telephone call 
When plaintiff Dennis Ginther testified in Denver he was 
crossexamined by defense attorney Michael Soileau in Metairie 
La a New Orleans suburb 
I like to think in Colorado were always trying advanced 
techniques said Fullerton a District Court judge Defense 
attorneys had sent exhibits to the court in advance he said and 
attorneys in both cities were sent copies 
The case involving a Louisiana firm did not close as scheduled 
last month and defense attorneys and defendants returned to 
Louisiana So Fullerton scheduled the court session by telephone 
That saved the defendants and attorneys a second trip to Denver 
which would have cost 1500 in air fare alone Soileau said 
I dont know what the cost of the phone call will be but it 
will be substantially less said Fullerton 
Ginther who is based here is seeking 13525 in appraisal 
services he said he performed for Financial Management Services of 
Metairie in 1985 plus interest and attorneys fees The Louisiana 
company claimed Ginther was paid according to the contracts terms 
Fullerton heard the telephone testimony Friday but did not 
issue a ruling 
The judge admitted that the experiment has limitations He cant 
tell during questioning if a defendant is being counseled by 
attorneys on the other end And a jury trial would be difficult to 
conduct by phone 
But his clerk Ginny Dondelinger said theres one advantage 
Attorneys talk less on the telephone than when they can act 
out in court she said
