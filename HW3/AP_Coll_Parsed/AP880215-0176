The AFLCIO said Monday it will ask 
Congress to give government inspectors the power to close unsafe 
workplaces and make it easier to file criminal complaints for 
violations resulting in death or injury 
Holding its annual winter meeting here this week the labor 
federations 36member executive council said the 17yearold 
Occupational Health and Safety Act is badly out of date with 
other job and community safety laws 
Reforms are needed to expand protections to workers not 
currently covered to expedite standard setting and to require 
working training and education the council said 
Although the details of the requested legislation have yet to be 
worked out Margaret Seminario deputy director of the AFLCIOs 
occupational safety and health department said it will include a 
provision broadening coverage to several groups of workers now 
exempted 
Among them are workers in the nuclear industry some 3 million 
transportation workers and more than 14 million employees of state 
and local governments 
The 143millionmember labor federation said it also wants to 
give inspectors for the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration the same authority that a sister agency the Mine 
Safety and Health Administration has to shut down a plant or other 
workplace when there is a significant hazard posing an immediate 
threat to workers 
OSHA inspectors can do that in some limited cases now but they 
first have to obtain a court order Some companies also have 
refused to allow OSHA inspectors to even enter their plants without 
such an order 
By contesting an OSHA citation for a violation companies 
effectively can postpone abating or correcting an unsafe condition 
until all appeals are exhausted Ms Seminario said 
The AFLCIO measure also would require safety and health 
committees with union or other worker representation at each job 
site The committees would be given the right to conduct 
inspections review an employers hazard control measures and 
direct a shutdown of a dangerous job 
Business groups also want the law changed but in a different 
way The US Chamber of Commerce has called for legislation that 
would mandate costbenefit analyses now being practiced as policy 
under the Reagan adminstration before OSHA can issue new or 
toughen existing health and safety regulations 
The chamber also wants to prohibit OSHA from interference in 
issues that it says more appropriately belong under the 
jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board 
In the past year unions have succeeded in getting OSHA to levy 
fines up to more than 25 million against companies such as IBP 
Corp the nations largest meatpacker and International Paper 
Co during strikes and other labor disputes
