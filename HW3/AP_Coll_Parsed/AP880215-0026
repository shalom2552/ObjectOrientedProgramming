Sen Gordon Humphrey RNH spends his days 
in solitude with his computer and his headset working in a 
hideaway office where he feels like hes back in a DC9 cockpit 
Seventynine members of the Senate are assigned to the existing 
79 Senate hideaways little second offices where they are supposed 
to be able to reflect away from the relentless demands of their 
time 
But unlike most senators Humphrey has turned his public 
spacious office in the modern Hart office building over to his 
staffers and turned his oneman Capitol hideaway into a fulltime 
hightech command center 
There he sits alone communicating with his staff all day by 
electronic message convinced he is pushing ahead of Senate 
inertia 
The circular room looks and feels like a cockpit as Humphrey a 
former Allegheny Airlines pilot punches up computer displays 
talks through his headset and fiddles with the dials on his radio 
Back at the Hart building every staffer sits at a computer 
terminal There are no secretaries no typewriters and no paper 
except for computer printouts Soft computer beeps announce an 
incoming message 
The staff calls the office the 3C center military jargon 
for command control and communications 
I love this stuff Humphrey says as he sits at the computer 
controls I find the detachment very useful There isnt enough 
time to think and read around this place 
Humphrey says there are parallels between his office and a 
cockpit Ive got everything at my fingertips he says You 
reach for dials in front of you and reach things above your head 
When the television set and radio are off theres only the 
sound of rushing air from the air conditioner Thats similar to 
the sound of a jet cockpit 
Humphrey boasts that his office is a wonderful timesaver 
calculating it takes nearly 15 minutes for a roundtrip between the 
Hart building and the Capitol for a vote Now hes only a minute 
or two from the Senate chamber 
The hideaway Humphrey insists is not a place where he hides 
from his staff and constituents 
Staffers see me when they need to see me he says Any 
constituent desiring to see him is escorted to the hideaway 
Darryl Fountain the senators former legal counsel who is now 
in private practice says the system fits Humphreys personality as 
a very disciplined person 
Heres somebody who was an airline pilot who was elected to 
his first office as a senator Fountain says Hes not a 
backslapper Hes not a BS artist Most of the other senators 
had long years in public life He does not have the typical 
political personality that finds him operating surrounded by staff 
Hes a loner in the sense that hes somebody who has not been 
compromised by Washington lifestyle where you go to big 
receptions parties and blacktie dinners He doesnt care about 
his standing visavis the Senate club 
Its time for Humphrey to check his phone messages Strongly 
oppose Contras one message says Will names be turned over to 
FBI 
Humphreys staffers also have learned to make maximum use of the 
computer punching in fashion notes about each others clothes 
wheels up invitations for afterwork drinks and contributing 
to an electronic suggestion box 
Will the person who brings in sandwiches neatly wrapped in wax 
paper please eat them says one message Today we had to 
dispose of seven petrified sandwiches in seven individual greasy 
brown lunch bags 
Although current Humphrey employees just chuckle when asked 
about it former staffer Fountain says when one staffer wanted to 
razz another he or she would send the electronic finger 
That was a computer drawing of a hand with an obscene gesture 
It started out as a small hand Some of us tried to outdo that 
with bigger ones Fountain recalls No one ever sent it to the 
senator 
We pride ourselves in taking technology to the limit says 
administrative assistant Frank Bray who wouldnt talk about the 
finger 
Humphrey isnt all business either When he cleaned out items 
from his home he gave them away through the computer a sofa 
calculators tape recorders and even old cars 
It seems more unusual from the outside says Paul Young a 
former special assistant now working for Rep Jack Kemps 
presidential campaign People have the perception hes sitting in 
a black hole with no interaction with his people 
Humphrey looks at one of the monitors It reminds him to take 
his allergy shots and his vitamins 
Do you want to talk to the staff about the system Humphrey 
asks at the end of the interview 
A reporter agreed and Humphrey tried to telephone his press 
secretary No answer 
This is the problem when you rely on the phones says 
Humphrey who quickly sent a computer message that brought a fast 
response
