A group of leading Israeli writers 
called on the government to withdraw from the occupied territories 
and conduct direct negotiations with Palestinian leaders 
I am in favor of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as early 
as tomorrow morning author Amos Oz told more than 500 people who 
gathered to protest Israeli policy in the occupied lands 
I am in favor of a Palestinian state because that is the 
way to life Other ways lead to death 
The Association of Israeli Playwrights organized Tuesdays 
gathering which drew widely known actors singers and poets 
including several who had not previously expressed their views 
publicly on the unrest in the occupied lands 
One of them poet Erez Biton said that the riots in the 
occupied territories made it clear to him that through 20 years of 
Israeli occupation the Palestinians had become a nation 
I think this is the first time Im not too mad at the 
Palestinians Biton said From their point of view their 
behavior is absolutely one of honor 
The disturbances which broke out Dec 8 have intensified the 
controversy among Israelis about what to do with the territories 
captured during the 1967 Middle East war 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir head of the rightwing Likud 
Bloc is against yielding any part of the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip in return for peace Foreign Minister Shimon Peres head 
of the leftleaning Labor Party favors compromise 
Both Israeli leaders advocate peace talks with Jordan and refuse 
to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization which is 
outlawed in Israel as a terrorist group 
According to UN figures the unrest has left 54 Palestinians 
dead most by Israeli gunfire 
The army has used live bullets then rubber ones and finally 
beatings to quell the protests Israeli troops have wounded or 
severely beaten hundreds of Palestinians and more than 1000 others 
been detained or jailed 
Oz said the Israeli crackdown on Palestinian demonstrators was 
increasing hatred between Arabs and Israelis He predicted Israels 
occupation would eventually collapse whether the two sides reach 
agreement or not 
Yehoshafat Harkabi a lecturer at the Hebrew University said 
Israelis and Arabs were beginning to realize they have no choice 
but to accept one another 
The Arabs have learned that if the conflict continues it will 
become hell for both Israel and the Arab countries said Harkabi 
a former army intelligence chief Both the Palestinians and the 
Israelis will suffer because both are in the same boat 
Harkabi said Israel must start negotiating right away 
The longer we wait the worse the conditions will be he 
said I realized long ago that if Israel adopts a moderate policy 
we will achieve the best possible terms 
Oz said peace advocates must persuade Likud voters to vote for 
leftwing parties in elections scheduled for the fall 
We must try to talk seriously with the many people in Israel 
who are afraid to give the West bank towns of Nablus Hebron and 
Ramallah back to the Arabs because they are afraid the Arabs will 
chase us out of Haifa as well Oz said 
The feelings are complicated They include an element of 
genuine fear historical trauma many years of Palestinian threats 
and an element of rightwing demagogy he said
