The US trade deficit narrowed to 122 
billion in December as exports hit new records but the overall 
1712 billion shortfall for 1987 still measured the highest ever 
the government said Friday 
Decembers merchandise trade deficit was down from 132 billion 
in November and from 176 billion in October and was the smallest 
figure since a 119 billion trade gap in January 1987 the 
Commerce Department said 
The improvement was driven by a 42 percent rise in exports 
which reached record levels for the second month in a row 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 
2172 to 198326 a subdued response to the trade report Bond 
prices fell as concern grew about inflation but the dollar soared 
against most major currencies 
Both private and government analysts pointed toward the December 
report as strong evidence of the longawaited reversal in the 
nations trade peformance 
The tide has turned declared Allen Sinai chief economist 
for the Boston Company Economic Advisers Inc 
Exports in December were 248 billion a new record up from 
238 billion in November the previous record Imports meanwhile 
held steady at 370 billion the same as the month before 
Were beginning to see our economy driven by exports and that 
means economic vitality and increased jobs for Americans 
Commerce Secretary C William Verity said in a statement 
But he said the overall deficit for the year up 96 percent 
from 1562 billion in 1986 was unacceptable We have a long 
way to go until we can be comfortable 
For all of 1987 Americans imported 4241 billion in goods from 
other countries while exporting 2529 billion compared with 1986 
imports of 3830 billion and exports of 2268 billion 
Analysts credited the slide in the dollar now worth half of 
its 1985 value against the Japanese yen and key European currencies 
as being the major factor in the recent export surge 
A devalued dollar makes American goods cheaper abroad 
And while it will also eventually drive up the price of 
imports this effect has not yet been fully realized as many 
foreign manfacturers take smaller profit margins to hang onto their 
share of lucrative US markets analysts said 
Still other economists suggested that the December figures be 
looked at cautiously claiming that the monthly trade figures 
although closely watched by financial markets tend to be erratic 
For one thing the figures are not adjusted to remove the impct 
of seasonal factors such as increases in imports before Christmas 
and when newmodel auto shipments come in early each summer 
On a seasonal basis the trade gap traditionally improves in 
December and January economists said 
To meet this concern the Commerce Department announced on 
Friday that beginning with the release of April trade figures it 
would seasonally adjust the monthly data 
In other economic data on Friday 
The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index rose 04 
percent in January equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of 
46 percent with higher costs for a variety of items including 
food offsetting lower energy prices 
The Commerce Department said business inventories shot up 08 
percent in December the third consecutive large monthly advance 
pushing unsold stockpiles on shelves and backlots up by 545 
billion to a seasonally adjusted 70187 billion 
Of the December trade figures US Trade Representative Clayton 
Yeutter said This is a sign that there are better days ahead on 
the trade front 
And Jay Goldinger senior economist for Cantor Fitzgerald a 
bond brokerage predicted that imports would soon begin to fall as 
sharply as exports have risen as we work off the high level of 
import inventories 
Were in the middle of a major change of course But its a 
big ship and you dont turn around a big ship on a dime 
Goldinger said At least we know were headed home again 
The United States continued to run its largest deficit with 
Japan last year 598 billion up from 586 billion in 1986 
However imports from Japan in December held at their November 
level of 48 billion 
Eclipsing Western Europe for the first time as the 
secondlargest trade deficit were the socalled four tigers of 
Asia the newly industrialized nations of Taiwan South Korea Hong 
Kong and Singapore Together the trade deficit with those nations 
in 1987 rose to 377 billion up from 308 billion in 1986 
The deficit with Western Europe meanwhile narrowed to 302 
billion from 327 billion in the previous year 
Trade accounts with Canada this nations largest single 
trading partner also improved during 1987 to a deficit of 117 
billion from 132 billion in 1986 
For the full year imports of manufactured goods rose 107 
percent to 3252 billion while exports of US manufactured goods 
rose 153 percent to 1715 billion 
Oil imports were up 191 percent to 448 billion as oil 
prices rebounded from their 1986 collapse 
And in the only major category in which the United States has 
consistently maintained a surplus farm product exports were up 96 
percent to 286 billion 
Automobile imports from Japan totaled 222 billion for the 
year a 09 percent increase But those from Canada were down 135 
percent to 102 billion 
From all other countries auto imports were up a sharp 322 
percent to 168 billion reflecting popularity of model lines 
like the South Korean Hyundai automobile
