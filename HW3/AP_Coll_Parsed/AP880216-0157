The nations armed forces are running short of 
a critical spare part uniforms 
The situation has gotten so bad according to a new survey that 
the Marine Corps is issuing IOUs for coats to enlisted men and 
women 
Moreover the Navy is reducing its supplies of peacoats and blue 
jumpers at military exchanges to clothe recruits graduating from 
boot camp the Air Force has reduced from two to one the number of 
blue service coats issued to many recruits and the Army is running 
out of coats shortsleeve shirts field caps and trousers 
As the newspaper Navy Times stated Tuesday The naked truth is 
that the military is running out of uniforms 
The independent newspaper said it had surveyed the four services 
and found agreement that the shortage could be traced to the 
Defense Personnel Support Center in Philadelphia That center has 
been wracked over the past year by a kickback scandal involving a 
handful of clothing companies and some Defense Department employees 
Recovering from the indictments is our major problem said 
Paul Zebrowski the deputy director of the centers Clothing and 
Textile Directorate 
It became impossible to do business with those companies And 
even before our production base was very small 
The Marine Corps appears to be the hardest hit the newspaper 
said with dwindling stocks of all three types of its uniform coats 
A recent directive instructed Marine boot camps to issue one 
complete green uniform to recruits along with an appropriate due 
member certificate IOU for the coats not issued 
Clothing stores also have been told to stop selling dress blue 
Marine coats except to those individuals in receipt of orders 
where the blue uniform is required for the performance of duty 
the directive added 
In the Navy men and women already in the fleet are finding 
reduced selections of uniforms at exchanges when they need to 
replace worn clothes because the service is giving boot camps first 
priority 
We feel very strongly that a recruit will have a full seabag 
when he leaves boot camp said Becky Atkins a Navy uniform 
official 
The Army is giving its recruits one field cap now instead of 
two and last August started running low on certain sizes of coats 
after clothing contractors were debarred for misconduct 
The Air Force meanwhile has been forced to cut back its issue 
of blue service coats to many recruits from two to one Those with 
coat sizes in short supply are being given cash allowances to buy 
their second coat after graduation said Capt Beth Unklesbay 
Zebrowski declined to predict when the shortages might be 
alleviated saying Were fighting this on an itembyitem 
basis
