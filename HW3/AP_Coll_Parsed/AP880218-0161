following the withdrawal of former Secretary of State Alexander 
Haig last Friday 
You have given me the opportunity of a lifetime said du

to GOP frontrunners George Bush and Bob Dole but he finished far 
down in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary 
Du Pont took note of his controversial stands on issues from 
mandatory drug testing for high school students to elimination of 
farm subsidies and said We have moved those challenges forward 
to the center of the debate they are urgent they are real they 
will not disappear 
Neither will our efforts to address them All of us can pause 
to catch our breath none of us should think it time to end our 
quest he told about a hundred supporters in his hometown 
Du Pont who officially began his campaign 17 months ago 
thanked his supporters 
In America we do not promise that everyone wins only that 
everyone has the opportunity to try You have given me the 
opportunity he said 
You listened considered and chose I could not have asked for 
more 
The former twoterm governor finished fourth in a field of five 
in Tuesdays New Hampshire primary barely edging former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson 
Du Pont won 10 percent of the GOP vote in New Hampshire netting 
him his first and only two delegates to the Republican national

interview later that week with the Wilmington NewsJournal du Pont
