A new production of Siegfried a new tenor 
to sing it and a superlative performance by the entire cast filled 
the evening at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday 
Wolfgang Neumann scheduled to make his Met debut as Siegfried 
on Feb 20 made it instead on the first night of the new 
Siegfried production because Peter Hofmann had a bronchial 
infection and withdrew 
Neumann from Kaernten Austria a member of the Mannheim Opera 
in Germany has a golden voice It isnt the kind with a golden 
pinging edge but a full rich voice which remained freshsounding 
through this long part 
Neumann didnt hold back in the first two acts as some tenors 
do for his duets with Brunnhilde in Act 3 Neumann sounded 
innocent as Siegfried should and he looked like an attractive 
large country boy 
Hildegard Behrens sang glowingly as Brunnhilde her top notes 
sounding effortless and tender never blaring 
Otto Schenk directed the meeting of Siegfried and Brunnhilde 
well They must do a lot of singing before they embrace Schenk has 
Siegfried exhibit much wonderment circling the rock on which he 
found Brunnhilde 
We liked the direction of Mime less Horst Hiestermann sang the 
part well but several times skipped about too frivolously for such 
a villain 
Also the dragon in a suddenly darkened Act 2 was unpleasantly 
startling in a production which has Siegfried in Act 1 forge a 
broken sword with meticulous realism It was a frightening monster 
waving various ugly heads out from several holes in a rock wall 
Anne Gjevang had a sweet though hooded tone as Erda She 
appeared in an otherworldly blue light to sing with the Wanderer 
Donald McIntyre sounded wise and sympathetic as the Wanderer 
his voice did not tire 
James Levine conducted taking the overture very slowly and 
making the most of every nuance note and pause Most of the 
evening was taken at a faster pace though there were other places 
where Levine slowed the tempo 
Gunther SchneiderSiemsen designed the sets which included 
wonderful deep forests
