Two former executives of the BeechNut 
Nutritional Corp face substantial prison terms and fines after 
being convicted of selling flavored sugar water labeled as apple 
juice for babies 
Former BeechNut president Neils L Hoyvald and a former vice 
president John F Lavery were charged with hundreds of violations 
of federal food and drug laws along with conspiracy and mail fraud 
Lavery was convicted Wednesday of all 448 counts in the 
indictment said federal prosecutor Thomas Roche 
Hoyvald was found guilty on 351 counts of violating federal food 
and drug laws the jury however could not reach a verdict on 
about 80 other counts against him including conspiracy and mail 
fraud Roche said 
The maximum penalty for conspiracy is five years in prison and a 
10000 fine for mail fraud five years and 1000 and for food 
and drug law violations three years and 10000 Roche said 
US District Court Judge Thomas C Platt did not set a date for 
sentencing but it should be within six to eight weeks Roche said 
Roche said both Hoyvald and Lavery who were allowed to remain 
free on bail until sentencing face substantial prison terms and 
substantial fines It is likely however that they would serve 
concurrent sentences 
Lawyers for both men declined to comment on the verdict but said 
they would appeal the convictions 
Roche called the result of the threemonth trial an important 
victory for consumers 
The corporation which also was named in the November 1986 
indictments pleaded guilty last year a fact the judge withheld 
from the jury 
BeechNut a subsidiary of Nestle Inc and based in Fort 
Washington Pa agreed to pay a 2 million fine and also settled 
a classaction suit by agreeing to set up a 5 million cash fund 
for consumers and to provide 25 million in BeechNut and 
affiliated products to retailers 
The indictment charged that BeechNut shipped adulterated juice 
throughout the United States and overseas from 1978 to 1983 No 
evidence was presented that the juice caused any health problems 
Hoyvalds attorney Brendan Sullivan Jr urged the jury not to 
believe the testimony of two key prosecution witnesses who work for 
BeechNut that they had repeatedly warned executives that the 
concentrate used to make the produce contained little or no apple 
juice 
Steven Kimelman Laverys attorney said his client was a man 
who had nothing to gain by committing a crime Lavery was in 
charge of manufacturing at the Canajoharie plant in western New 
York where the product was bottled
