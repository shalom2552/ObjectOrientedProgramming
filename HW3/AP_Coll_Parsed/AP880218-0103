Canadian authorities are investigating a report 
that an American was offered the job of assassinating Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney a spokeswoman said 
We are aware from press reports of the allegations that John 
Wayne Hearn was approached in 1984 to assassinate the prime 
minister Constable Danielle Poirier of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police said Wednesday 
We are actively pursuing an investigation of this allegation 
with US authorities We have no further comment at this time 
Hearn is serving three life terms in Florida for murder His 
classified ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine led to a 225 million 
suit against the publication by the family of a Texas woman They 
claim the 1984 ad led to the womans murder 
Hearn said in a deposition read in federal court Wednesday that 
responses to his advertisement for highrisk assignments 
included one seeking the assassination of the president of Canada 
The deposition given Oct 13 and read in a Houston court did 
not go into detail about the Canadian assassination request and did 
not mention Mulroney by name 
Hearn also has claimed that Canadians financed the aborted 
overthrow of the president of French Guiana to the tune of 100000 
Hearn said in a deposition that the Guianese president was 
terrorizing the population with murderous hit squads But French 
Guiana is a protectorate of France and has no president 
Hearn alleged that he and 11 others trained in Tennessee for 
about six weeks before setting out for the South American country 
They aborted the mission when they developed engine trouble 
while flying over the Gulf of Mexico he said 
The suit against Soldier of Fortune magazine stems from the 
death of Sandra Black of Bryan Texas whom Hearn admitted 
shooting in 1985 Her husband Robert is on death row for paying 
Hearn 10000 to carry out the killing 
Marjorie Einmann Mrs Blacks mother and Gary Black the 
victims 18yearold son contend in their suit that Hearns ad 
brought him to the attention of Robert Black
