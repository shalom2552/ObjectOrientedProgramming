A leader of the polygamist family that 
held off police for 13 days says hes sorry a corrections officer 
was killed in the shootout that ended the siege but that 
authorities had been warned not to go onto the property 
And Addam Swapp 26 who was wounded in the gunfight said he 
learned in a divine revelation that his life was spared because of 
his willingness to risk all for God 
Swapp is being held in the Salt Lake County Jail pending trial 
on attempted murder and bombing charges The bombing charges stem 
from an explosion at a Mormon chapel a halfmile from the 
polygamists farm at Marion 50 miles east of Salt Lake City The 
explosion led authorities to stake out the compound and to the 
13day standoff 
Another family member is suspected in the fatal shooting of Lt 
Fred House a dog handler with the state Corrections Department 
The bombing allegedly was in revenge for the death of polygamist 
patriarch John Singer who was killed in a confrontation with 
authorities nine years ago Swapp is married to two of Singers 
daughters and was a leader of the family along with Singers 
widow Vickie They blame the Mormon Church of which their group 
is an offshoot and police in Singers death 
Swapp in a telephone call to The Salt Lake Tribune from jail 
brought up Singers death saying Two people died in all of 
this just remember that and Singers blood still lies on the 
ground there too His comments were published in todays Tribune 
Swapp noted that he had warned of possible violence in a letter 
to the governor His note said in part TAKE A WARNING any man 
of yours which attempts to cross the Boundaries of this place 
without our Permission will be treated as an aggressive act on 
your part and we will Defend ourselves in any matter we see fit 
And thats what happened Swapp said 
Asked if he felt bad about the death he said Very Yes I do 
Of course I do 
Swapp said he was surprised to find himself in jail but believes 
God wants him there for a new mission 
The siege is over he said That price has been paid Now 
the Lord has a different mission and a different way and he wants 
to continue bringing forth this kingdom of God 
I do think the Lord is going to use the courts and a lot of 
stuff is going to come out he said
