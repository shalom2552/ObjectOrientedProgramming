Allegis Corp said Wednesday that a California 
court has granted its request to order a halt to union plans to 
block the companys restructuring 
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace 
Workers filed a lawsuit in January in California Superior Court 
contending that Allegis plan to sell its nonairline subsidiaries 
and distribute the proceeds to shareholders was illegal 
The union contended that the restructuring would create a higher 
debt load for Allegis core business Chicagobased United Airlines 
In a statement Wednesday Allegis said the California court held 
that California was an inappropriate place to resolve the question 
and ordered a stay of all proceedings 
It was not the headquarters of the company or where any of the 
transactions took place said Nancy Hobor a spokeswoman for 
Allegis 
The Allegis statement said the courts ruling does not prevent 
the union from refiling the action in an appropriate forum 
Ms Hobor said she did not know if the union has any such plans 
The unions headquarters in Washington DC was closed 
Wednesday night and a spokesman there could not be reached for 
comment 
The restructuring of Allegis which involves the sale of its 
Hertz rental car company and Westin and Hilton International hotel 
subsidiaries will push its debttoequity ratio from about 55 
percent to 80 percent company spokesman Matt Gonring said in 
January 
He said then that the restructuring would mean selling off 
equity but its not that were incurring new debt 
The company promised its 58 million shareholders it would give 
them a 50 dividend to distribute proceeds from the sales or would 
buy the equivalent amount of shareholders stock which would have 
tax advantages 
In January Gonring said the lawsuit was filed in San Francisco 
County because that is where the largest proportion of Uniteds 
21000 employees in the machinists union are based
