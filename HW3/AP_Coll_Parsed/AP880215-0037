Senate leaders say they have assured the 
European allies that the United States will not waver in its 
commitment to NATO regardless of who captures the White House this 
year 
That commitment includes the presence of US troops in Europe 
and a resolve to maintain a nuclear deterrent despite hopes for 
further progress in arms talks with the Soviets the senators said 
Senate Majority Leader Robert C Byrd and three other senators 
flew back to Andrews Air Force Base on Sunday following a nineday 
fivenation trip through Europe where they held talks with 
government leaders opposition figures and opinion makers 
Byrd a West Virginia Democrat said the allies unanimously 
expressed support for the INF Intermediaterange Nuclear Forces 
treaty without amendments 
We left the message with these leaders that the United States 
will continue fully to support NATO after the treaty is 
approved Those government leaders and the peoples of Europe wanted 
to hear that reassurance he said 
There was an extraordinary amount of agreement among those 
leaders and ourselves as to what the alliance should do in the 
postINF environment Byrd said 
Regardless of the various voices and noises and opinions that 
come out of Washington during elections the NATO alliance can 
count on this country for stability and continued support Byrd 
said We preached the message of cohesion and unity 
Byrd said the bumping of two US Navy ships by two Soviet 
warships in the Black Sea Friday was discouraging and feeds upon 
and contributes to the kind of skepticism that we found among 
European leaders about the Soviets 
Here were in this time of glasnost and detente and then all 
of a sudden we have one of these unprovoked confrontations 
he said Perhaps it serves a purpose in that it makes us stop 
look and listen and remember that caution is the watchword as we 
proceed with our relations 
Sen David L Boren DOkla chairman of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee said One of the things that we were most 
suprised about is there was less disagreement than we were led to 
believe before we went We read these stories that there were 
people proposing denuclearization of Europe We didnt find that 
anywhere 
Boren said the NATO allies believe the Soviets have two aims to 
divide NATO and to try to avoid conventional arms reductions 
where they have a clear superiority 
Byrd said Were all agreed that there has to continue to be 
the strategy of flexible response A nuclear deterrent must be an 
element of that strategy if it is to be credible 
Sens Claiborne Pell DRI the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee and John W Warner RVa the ranking 
minority member of the Armed Services Committee also flew back 
Sunday A fifth member of the delegation Sen Sam Nunn DGa the 
chairman of Armed Services flew home earlier The Senate leaders 
visited Germany England France Turkey and Italy 
Among the leaders they met with were Helmut Kohl the West 
German chancellor Margaret Thatcher the British prime minister 
Francois Mitterand the president of France Turgut Ozal the prime 
minister of Turkey and Giovanni Goria prime minister of Italy
