As Eastern Airlines pilots union fought in court 
to stop the transfer of the carriers Northeast Shuttle the leader 
of the nations unionized pilots said the takeover of Eastern 
routes by a small lowcost cargo company could lead to 
industrywide action 
Henry Duffy national chairman of the Air Line Pilots 
Association said Easterns plan to let tiny Orion Air operate 
Eastern planes out of Atlanta could draw full labor reaction 
Pilots all over the United States will see this as a threat to 
the professions Duffy told The Miami Herald in a story published 
today If one company could get away with this other companies 
with like minds could duplicate it 
US Rep Cardiss Collins DIll will hold hearings Tuesday in 
Washington over Orions proposed provision of pilots and crews to 
operate 26 planes out of Atlanta starting April 1 The pilots 
would receive onethird the pay now earned by Easterns crews 
according to details made public of the contract with Orion 
Eastern unions see the Orion deal as both a way for the 
moneylosing carrier to lower costs and to keep operating during a 
strike 
Meanwhile US District Judge Barrington D Parker in 
Washington on Thursday signed an order to expedite the pilots 
legal effort to stop the shuttle transfer and managements 
countereffort to move the transfer along 
He set an April 12 hearing The order also included requirement 
of a 10day notice to the pilots and court before any transfer of 
the shuttle meaning the shuttle transfer couldnt come before 
April 22 
Texas Air criticized a pilots press release that said Eastern 
was barred from the shuttle transfer until court ruling 
ALPA the Air Line Pilots Association has issued a 
misleading preposterous release They are up to their old 
tricks Texas Air spokesman Bruce Hicks said from Houston 
Hicks said the court order was a joint agreement among Eastern 
its parent company and the pilots and that it would allow 
management to keep its original schedule of midApril for making 
the Eastern shuttle a separate entity He said the agreement mainly 
set up a schedule for depositions and filings in the discovery or 
evidencegathering phase of the case 
Eastern had asked the court to dismiss the pilots challenge so 
it could go ahead with the shuttle transfer 
Texas Air outraged Easterns labor leaders last week by 
announcing the profitable BostonNew YorkWashington shuttle would 
become a Texas Air division called AirShuttle 
The pilots union last year filed suit seeking to block any 
transfer of Easterns assets 
Texas Air last year made Easterns reservations system a 
separate entity and transferred or sold some aircraft gates and 
routes to Continental Airlines also owned by Texas Air and other 
carriers 
Unilateral dismemberment by Texas Air Corp management of 
Eastern Airlines will not be tolerated said Capt Jack Bavis 
chairman of the Eastern pilots union The shuttle is not gone 
and we will fight to keep it within Eastern using every available 
resource 
Were confident that Judge Parker will agree with Eastern 
pilots that a unilateral Eastern Air Shuttle transfer is unlawful 
and nothing more than a unionbusting tool Bavis said in a 
prepared statement 
ALPA contends the sale of the shuttle service violates the 
federal Railway Labor Act by changing the working conditions of 
Eastern pilots without collective bargaining and undermining ALPAs 
collective bargaining status 
New York attorney James Linsey representing the pilots said he 
would seek Eastern and Texas Air internal memos and also will ask 
during depositions of Eastern and Texas Air officers about plans 
for any more asset transfers such as Latin American routes 
significant transfers of aircraft to other airlines 
Then we proceed to court for an injunction to prohibit the 
systematic dissection and dismantling of Eastern Airlines Linsey 
said 
Texas Air said it would pay Eastern reeling from a decade of 
losses 125 million cash and 100 million more in securities for 
the shuttle Eastern union officials say the shuttle has brought in 
more than 125 million cash in the last three years
