The publisher of Soldier of Fortune defending 
the magazine against a lawsuit by a slain womans family says he 
had no way of knowing a classified advertisement in the journal 
would lead to the womans death 
The family is seeking 225 million from the magazine accusing 
it of negligence for publishing the ad that brought Robert Black 
together with John Wayne Hearn and led to the murderforhire of 
Blacks wife Sandra 
I have no idea whats in the minds of people who place those 
ads Publisher Robert Brown testified Wednesday 
The Bryan woman was shot to death in 1985 Her husband is on 
Texas death row for paying Hearn 10000 to carry out the killing 
Hearn is serving three life terms in Florida for murder 
Marjorie Einmann Mrs Blacks mother and Gary Black the 
victims 18yearold son are seeking 25 million in actual 
damages and 20 million in punitive damages from the Coloradobased 
magazine 
Hearns ad appeared in four issues in late 1984 seeking former 
Marine and Vietnam veterans and weapons specialists with jungle 
warfare expertise for high risk assignments in the United 
States or overseas 
I never expected anyone to be so stupid to advertise in 
Soldier of Fortune their intent to do criminal enterprise said 
Brown 
Under questioning by plaintiffs attorney Ron Franklin Brown 
reviewed more than two dozen classified ads run in the magazine up 
to 1984 Many of the ads sought or advertised the services of 
selfproclaimed mercenaries weapons specialists explosives 
experts and mechanics a term Franklin said was synonymous with 
hired killers 
Brown said a mechanic in a high risk assignment also 
could mean someone who could fix a helicopter overseas 
Hearn said in a deposition read into testimony Wednesday that 
his ad brought responses from people who were looking for help with 
bombings assaults jail breaks and killings 
He said Black first contacted him about the sale of a gun 
collection and at their first meeting suggested he needed help to 
kill his wife 
After several discussions Hearn said he killed Mrs Black in 
February 1985 by shooting her twice in the head at her house 
In response to a question whether Soldier of Fortune or its 
publisher were responsible for his illegal activities he replied 
If I had never run an ad in Soldier of Fortune I would have 
never killed anyone 
Attorneys for the magazine do not dispute the magazine ad 
brought Hearn and Black together but they insist Brown had no way 
of knowing the ad was for illegal activity 
Magazine attorney Larry Thompson said the magazine was focused 
on Vietnam veterans and the classified ads were run as a source of 
employment for them but also appealed to military historians and 
people who like adventure 
According to Hearn whose deposition was taken last October the 
ad he placed was intended to attract bodyguard and security work
