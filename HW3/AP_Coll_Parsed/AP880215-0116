Nine years ago the forces of Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini overthrew the Peacock Throne of Iran and instituted a 
fundamentalist Islamic regime Now Khomeini is old and sick and a 
bloody war with neighboring Iraq continues Here is a look from 
within Iran by an Associated Press correspondent who visited it 
recently

Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeinis regime is in 
firm control as his fundamentalist Islamic revolution begins its 
10th year but a power struggle looms when the 87yearold 
patriarch dies 
His lieutenants appear to be preparing for Khomeinis death 
which will be a major test for the revolution at a time of war 
economic hardship and increasing international isolation 
Khomeini is reported in poor health and has sought recently 
after years of reluctance to eliminate obstacles to economic and 
social reform 
He remains the revered Imam symbol of an Islamic resurgence 
that toppled the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought 
Khomeini home in triumph Feb 1 1979 after 15 years in exile 
The old mans messianic charisma and authority have held the 
revolution together through the long war with Iraq and Irans 
other pressing international and domestic problems 
Jockeying for position in the misty world of Iranian politics 
has intensified because of elections for the 270seat Majlis or 
parliament scheduled for April 8 
Chief among the rival camps are the revolutionary purists 
personified by Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and those called 
pragmatists who are led by the parliament speaker Hashemi 
Rafsanjani 
No threat is evident to the regime itself despite political 
rivalries and domestic grumbling 
Senior revolutionary leaders acknowledge public discontent but 
say economic hardship stems from the war not the revolution Iraq 
invaded Iran in September 1980 after several border incidents 
They also claim more public projects have been completed than 
under the shah and more has been done for the mostathafeen 
deprived the millions of slum dwellers and peasants who formed 
the bedrock support for Khomeini 
Streets are full of people searching for bargains in the 
wellstocked stores which are prohibitively expensive or standing 
in long lines outside shops that sell rationed goods at 
governmentcontrolled prices 
Everything is available on the black market or free 
market as the Iranians call it at 10 times the official price 
Hojatoleslam Sadeq Khalkali a former Islamic prosecutor who 
ordered the execution of hundreds of opponents in the revolutions 
early days had this to say about political disagreement during a 
recent Majlis debate The brave troops at the front should not be 
worried by what may appear to be irreconcilable disagreements 
Security remains tight there is great distrust of foreigners 
and the United States still is the Great Satan 
Revolutionary Guards fanatical followers of Khomeini who are 
present in every village and city neighborhood appear to have 
stifled resistance 
Islamic puritanism pervasive in the early days after Khomeinis 
return has been relaxed somewhat 
Many women still wear the black headtotoe chador A sign 
outside Tehrans main bus terminal declares in English and Farsi 
Women not wearing Islamic garb will not be allowed to enter 
Others appear in public wearing only headscarves however and 
many women use lipstick and makeup Such Western decadence a 
few years ago would have meant arrest and humiliation by the Gashte 
Zahrah the religious vigilantes who patrol the city in unmarked 
cars watching for moral turpitude 
Gashte Zahrah patrols have not disappeared but they are less 
active 
Enforcement of the ban on alcoholic beverages also has eased 
Whisky vodka and other liquor are readily available on the black 
market 
Crowds are large at movie theaters where the fare generally is 
patriotic epics sagas of ancient Persian glories or feature films 
from Japan or the Soviet Union 
Staterun televisions two channels are dominated by religious 
and political discussions war footage and documentaries extolling 
Iranian victories 
The governments efficient security network extends to village 
level Cities offices schools and businesses are governed by 
Islamic councils run by loyalists of the regime 
By Western count two million Iranians many of them middle 
class have fled rather than put up with Islamic restrictions 
economic privation and sending their sons to the war 
An estimated 600000 Iranians have been killed and 750000 
wounded but foreign diplomats say the conflict has helped 
strengthen the revolution despite the cost 
It has built patriotic fervor in the mass of Persian Irans 
overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem population of about 50 million against 
the Iraqis who are Arabs and ancient enemies 
Theres dissatisfaction with the strict Islamic rules imposed 
on people and with the economic hardship but at the same time most 
people are proud that Iran has resisted the Iraqi invasion and so 
much pressure from the United States one Western diplomat said 
privately 
People realize theres little they can do They live in hope 
the war may end soon either through victory or a settlement so 
that at least their economic hardship will be alleviated
