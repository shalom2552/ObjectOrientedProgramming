The wild abandon of Mardi Gras gave way to 
the sobriety of Ash Wednesday today as police cleared the French 
Quarter of revelers hoping to forestall the end of the annual 
street party 
Two fatal accidents involving parade floats marred the feverish 
excitement of the Carnival season police said 
Officially the day concluded at midnight with the meetings of 
the courts of Rex and Comus the signal that Mardi Gras has given 
way to 40 days of Lenten penance 
I enjoy it to the max but its Ash Wednesday Mardi Gras is 
over The normal standards of behavior now apply Carl Seyler 
Jr a resident of the French Quarter said early today 
Nearly a million people immersed themselves this year in New 
Orleans naughty exhibition of drinking dancing and parading said 
New Orleans police spokesman John Bryson 
Revelers not ready to give up the Fat Tuesday ghost were shooed 
into bars and clubs as uniformed officers and mounted police 
announced on bullhorns that streets were being reopened and cleanup 
crews were on their way 
Mardi Gras 1988 is now over police announced Please 
clear the streets and get off the sidewalks 
An 11yearold boy was killed Tuesday afternoon when he was run 
over by a truck float in suburban New Orleans and an unidentified 
man was killed when he leaped onto a tractortrailer rig hauling a 
float in city traffic police said 
The last floatrelated death was in 1984 Bryson said 
This does not happen every year he said The safety 
conscious individuals on the parade routes do not approach floats 
that are moving 
Despite the accidents which also included two incidents in 
which people were injured badly enough to be hospitalized police 
described the crowds as generally wellbehaved 
Police spokesman John Marie said the Canal Street crowd was the 
biggest he had seen in 18 years 
Im ready for it to be over thats for sure Its all good 
and fun but Im glad its over with said Carl Chosa of New 
Orleans I hope everybody comes back next year 
But Ray Mattingly of Memphis Tenn wasnt quite willing for 
the bacchanalia to end 
I think it should wind down of its own accord he said If 
they dont close the bars you should be allowed to be here as long 
as you want to
