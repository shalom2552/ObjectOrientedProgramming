The State Department is expressing interest in 
the efforts of three Eastern European countries to buy USmade 
passenger planes but cautions there may be some stumbling blocks 
Deputy Secretary of State John C Whitehead said Friday the 
three countries which he declined to identify have begun talks 
with the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft companies to supply 
longrange passenger planes to replace aging Soviet equipment in 
their national airlines 
Another official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
countries involved were Poland Hungary and Romania 
Whitehead said that from the State Departments viewpoint the 
sales would be feasible and desirable but he noted two 
potential problems 
Buying US aircraft would require large expenditures by the 
governments and credits from the US ExportImport Bank for the 
purchases would not be available Whitehead said 
The aircraft companies moreover would be prohibited from 
selling equipment on a list of militaryapplicable goods banned for 
export to communist countries This could limit the type of 
airplanes the countries could buy

The government is reviewing use of the 
insecticide dichlorvos common in flykilling pest strips and other 
applications in the wake of studies on laboratory animals that 
show the chemical may cause cancer and liver damage 
A special review such as that announced Friday by the 
Environmental Protection Agency could lead to fewer or more 
restrictions a ban on the product or its exoneration 
Some 2 million pounds of dichlorvos are used in about 800 
products every year About 25 percent is used on farm crops 35 
percent on livestock 25 percent in commercial and industrial 
buildings and on lawns and ornamental crops and 15 percent in 
homes and on pets EPA said 
Dichlorvos has been used since 1948 against flies mosquitoes 
gnats cockroaches and other insects

A federal judge says the Environmental 
Protection Agency hasnt produced any evidence to back its 
assertion that distribution of remaining stocks of the pesticide 
chlordane wont cause undue harm 
US District Judge Louis F Oberdorfer said Friday the EPA 
hadnt legally proven it can authorize the retail sale of small 
amounts of the pesticide chlordane as part of a deal to ultimately 
take the antitermite chemical off the market 
The agencys latest court filing does not satisfy federal law 
which requires the EPA to determine that a pesticide will not 
unreasonably harm the environment he said 
The EPA believes that chlordane causes cancer To avoid a 
protracted battle with 197 distributors the agency has agreed to 
let them sell chlordane already in stock In return the companies 
are argeeing to cancellation of their licenses to sell the 
pesticide

The Navy and Pentagon say they cant explain 
why they didnt honor a widows request to withhold public 
announcement that a military laboratory had identified the remains 
of her husband who died in the Vietnam War 
The widow Erna McKinney of San Diego Calif said in a 
telephone interview she had asked that the identification be 
withheld because she wanted to obtain a second opinion to verify 
the militarys forensic work 
The Navy acknowledged late Friday that due to an oversight 
the remains of Navy Lt Clemie McKinney an aviator who was lost 
over South Vietnam on April 14 1972 had been transported from 
Hawaii to California this week without informing Mrs McKinney 
I told them I didnt want them to release the identification 
because I wasnt prepared to accept the finding that I wanted a 
second opinion said Mrs McKinney 
All I can say is that we routinely abide by the familys 
desires on that point said Lt Col Keith Schneider If we had 
been aware of that request here at the Pentagon we would have 
made sure the identification was not released publicly
