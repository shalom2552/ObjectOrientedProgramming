At the tender age of 18 when most teenagers are 
thinking about college and careers Richard Wershe Jr faces life 
in prison 
The blond babyfaced Wershe was convicted last month of 
possessing eight kilos of cocaine worth about 5 million Police 
said that represented the largest single cocaine seizure in city 
history 
Wershe was sentenced Feb 4 to the mandatory penalty of life in 
prison without parole 
In a city where the fight against drugs is an uphill battle 
this case represented a critical government victory said William 
Coonce special agentincharge of the local office of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration 
Our total ability as a system to function was at stake he 
said If we couldnt convict this guy as outfront as brash as 
arrogant as he was what could we do 
It was a very important sign to the community we can do 
the job as well as deliver the message if you deal in these 
quantities youre going to go to jail for life 
But Coonce added Its almost insulting to our profession 
that any 18yearold could get to this kind of stature without us 
being able to snuff him out a long time ago The fact this guy 
is so young is symbolic of whats going on in this city 
Wershe known on the street as White Boy Rick because most 
of his associates are black still faces two other drug charges 
His father Richard Sr who has sued the police alleging 
harassment recently told The Detroit News he and his son worked 
for several years as federal drug informants 
The FBI and DEA have declined comment 
The younger Wershe was at the top echelons of trafficking in 
Detroit supplying cocaine to a major crack dealer under 
investigation Coonce said 
Even though he looks like Baby Face Nelson Judge William 
Hathaway said in a hearing last year as far as this court is 
concerned hes worse than a mass murderer 
Wershes conviction stemmed from a May 1987 incident in which 
police found the cocaine in a box underneath a porch in the back of 
a house they said he had dropped it there after fleeing officers 
According to testimony Wershe was riding in a car stopped for a 
traffic violation in front of his grandmothers house A fight 
broke out when police tried to grab a bag they later retrieved 
containing 29000 
Wershe ran from the car but was later recaptured 
More than an hour later officers found the drugs in a box in a 
backyard a block from the grandmothers home At the trial a 
neighbor said Wershe ditched the box in her yard and offered her 
500 
Defense attorney Edward Bell said Wershe has nothing to do with 
the drugs and didnt know how they got there 
He argued Wershe was the victim of police brutality defense 
witnesses said he was punched and hit with a pistol and the drug 
charges were concocted to conceal the beating 
The government acknowledged police thumped Wershe but said 
there was no excessive force 
The defense also suggested authorities planted the drugs and 
pinned it on Wershe but prosecutors argued it was ludicrous to 
believe police carry around 176 pounds of dope just in case 
During the trial Wershe was often surrounded by people wearing 
furs and gold and carrying telephone pagers sometimes associated 
with drug dealers 
He was a local folk hero for the young people who came to 
court Coonce said 
Bell later said many of the kids hanging around the court 
were simply curious 
Wershes father has been charged with threatening a police 
officer who testified against his son Wershe Sr has filed two 
multimillion dollar lawsuits against the Detroit police and 
others alleging harassment invasion of privacy and other charges 
Though Coonce said Wershes sentence may deter some it will not 
stop the flow of drugs in Detroit As he said Theres not going 
to be any lack for cocaine
