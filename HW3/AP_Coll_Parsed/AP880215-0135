Tens of thousands of documents were stolen from a 
USrun Nazi records center prosecutors said Monday but there 
was no evidence to back a report they were used to blackmail former 
members of the Nazi party 
Volker Kaehne spokesman for the Berlin Justice Department said 
investigators suspect the deputy director of the Nazi archives was 
involved in the theft of Naziera documents from the Americanrun 
Berlin Document Center 
Our investigation so far indicates that the documents were 
stolen for profit he said There is no evidence to indicate 
suggestions that they were used for blackmail 
Kaehne said investigators suspect tens of thousands of documents 
were removed from the center a former telephone tapping center for 
the Gestapo or Nazi secret police 
The Berlin Morgenpost newspaper in its Tuesday editions said 
West German authorities have been told for years of suspicions that 
documents were being taken from the center 
An unidentified dealer offered British historian David Irving 
an expert on the Nazi era documents that allegedly came from the 
center nearly a decade ago the newspaper said 
Irving told West German authorities of the incident the paper 
said the officials launched an investigation but the probe was 
later dropped due to a lack of evidence 
The newspaper cited no sources for its report which was given 
in advance to The Associated Press 
On Monday Kaehne acknowledged an investigation into missing 
documents at the center was begun in 1983 but dropped for lack of 
progress in 1986 He said that inquiry was resumed last summer 
after an anonymous tip to authorities 
The Berlin Morgenpost said Sunday that 80000 files were missing 
from the center and former Nazis paid millions to keep their pasts 
secret and the documents from being made public 
It said many documents contained secret information about 
leading figures in the Third Reich 
In its Tuesday report the newspaper said those blackmailed 
included lawyers doctors and artists who belonged to Naziapproved 
professional organizations during Adolf Hitlers Third Reich 
Kaehne said prosecutors believe the missing documents may have 
been sold to dealers and collectors around the world for 
considerable sums 
There is evidence that some of these documents were sold for 
sums of up to 5000 marks 2900 apiece he said in a statement 
Kaehne said several West German dealers are targets of the 
investigation 
He said authorities recovered about 1500 documents including a 
letter from Hitlers doctor and correspondence from highranking 
Nazi leaders 
He did not say where the documents were found but Morgenpost 
said some documents were seized during a police raid on a Hamburg 
dealer 
Thomas Homan spokesman for the US mission in Berlin could 
not be reached for comment on Monday a US holiday 
On Sunday he confirmed a criminal investigation into missing 
documents was under way and said US officials were cooperating 
with West Berlin prosecutors
