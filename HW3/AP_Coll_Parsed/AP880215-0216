The South Korean press is enjoying a 
broad degree of freedom after years of tough official control but 
opposition quarters maintain it still is manipulated by the 
governments hidden hands 
Nevertheless the nations newspapers are reporting and 
commenting more vigorously on politics and other subjects that for 
years had been limited or banned by the government 
Presidentelect Roh Taewoo who takes office Feb 25 promises 
to ensure full press freedom and made it a key point in his 
election campaign The government began easing press restrictions 
last summer under pressure from Roh 
We have done much and there should be nothing to complain 
about said Lee Jungbai the assistant cultureinformation 
minister 
Journalists agree the government has abandoned most controls on 
the domestic press such as regular visits to newspapers by 
security agents and the issuance of press guidelines that 
dictated what could be reported and in what way 
Government reguirements on registration of journalists have been 
dropped and new legislation will end limits on newspapers having 
news bureaus outside their headquarters locations There also will 
be no limits on the number of pages a newspaper can publish 
The ball is in the court of the news media Its up to them 
said Rep Lee Minsup a ranking member of Rohs Democratic Justice 
Party 
Opposition politicians and dissidents contend however that 
much of the press still remains under government control through 
hidden hands 
Rep Kim Taeryong spokesman for the main opposition 
Reunification Democratic Party said No basic changes have been 
made and the press still is no more than a public relations tool of 
the government 
The opposition claims the government exerts behindthescenes 
influence and control ranging from intimidation to patronage and 
bribery They also contend the media is packed with government 
supporters 
Rep Ahn Dongsun spokesman for the opposition Party for Peace 
and Democracy claimed journalists are practicing selfcensorship 
Kim Taehong secretarygeneral of the dissident Council for 
Democratic Press Movement said Essentially Roh is the same as 
his dictatorial predecessor He would not give in easily We must 
continue to fight for press freedom 
Several editors and reporters rejected the opposition charges of 
selfcensorship but said they want to help ensure sound 
political development without endangering social stability 
One senior editor speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
many journalists are cautious because they suspect the true 
intention of the government 
The opposition claims the countrys two networks which are 
stateowned project only a government viewpoint and that opposing 
points of view receive little attention or are distorted 
A Korea Broadcasting System KBS spokesman Lim Ungshik 
rejected the oppositions charges 
Our news and other programs are fair by any standard he 
said 
Lim said KBS has recently started some new programs including 
talk shows to which opposition figures are regularly invited 
Government officials say the criticism the networks may end 
after a neutral broadcasting committee is set up in June as 
required by a new law to nominate the heads of the two networks 
Some opposition lawmakers will be appointed to serve on the 
committee to ensure fairness 
The government is also preparing to inaugurate in March a new 
press law that would drop a requirement for government approval to 
start new newspapers or periodicals 
Seven newspapers have so far applied to start publishing under 
the new law South Korea now has 20 national daily newspapers with 
an estimated combined circulation of 12 million 
The first beneficiary of the new law would be a newspaper that 
some 200 dissident journalists plan to publish this spring with 
support from 3300 sponsors including 1000 college professors 
100 lawyers 200 religious leaders and 200 literary figures 
Song Kunho president of the newspaper The Hankyoreh Shinmun 
said the project will be started with 5 billion won 68 million 
to be raised through public shares Song said 15000 people have so 
far responded contributing about half of the needed money 
Song and the other journalists dismissed from their previous 
jobs on grounds of antigovernment activity said their newspaper 
would emphasize human rights and spearhead press freedom 
The influential Roman Catholic Church also has announced it will 
start a newspaper in April and set up a nationwide radio network in 
September 
Critics of the government contend the new press law is 
restrictive because it stipulates that new newspapers must use 
certain kinds of presses that cost millions of dollars They 
contend this would keep control of the press in the hands of 
establishment groups
