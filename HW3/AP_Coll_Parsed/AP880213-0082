A gerbil named Ken campaigning on a 
platform of free beer and soft toilet paper beat five other 
candidates to become president of the Student Union at the 
University of East Anglia 
Kens owner chemistry student Julian Campbell 21 said he 
entered his pet as a joke and was amazed that the mouselike rodent 
won the job which pays 9450 a week The university is in Norwich 
in northeast England 
Ken polled well over a third of the 1500 votes beating his 
nearest competitor by 194 votes He celebrated his victory Friday 
night with sunflower seeds and a sip of vodka from a water bottle 
I think hell make a great president And he definitely wont 
be making any boring speeches Campbell was quoted as telling The 
Star 
But outgoing Student Union president Rob Davies 23 was not 
amused 
The students have not taken the vote seriously Davies was 
quoted as telling the Daily Mirror I dont think many know how 
much hard work goes into the job 
Ken was named after Education Secretary Kenneth Baker whose 
education reform bill is currently being considered by Parliament 
But it turns out the name is somewhat of a misnomer 
Campbell found out during the campaign that Ken is actually a 
female and is pregnant
