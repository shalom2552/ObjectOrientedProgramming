A military spokesman said Friday 
the armed forces will investigate allegations that highranking 
officers are involved in drug trafficking 
Col Manuel Suarez Benavides told reporters This situation 
worries the High Command and all of us 
We are going to investigate 
The New York Times published an article Friday saying senior 
Honduran military officers and a drug dealer linked to Colombias 
Medellin Cartel are setting up a major narcotics smuggling 
operation in this Central American country 
The Times story quoted unidentified US and Honduran officials 
Asked about the allegations Suarez said We dont rule them 
out because there are no means to refute them nor is there proof 
of guilt 
The armed forces call on the The New York Times to provide the 
names of those Honduran officers involved in the alleged drug 
trafficking as well as the corresponding proof implicating 
officers of our army he said 
With the proof in hand we will move drastically against those 
responsible and we will punish them with all the weight of the 
law said Suarez the spokesman for the armed forces 
The Times article identified Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros as a 
principal figure in the alleged operation Matta a Honduran 
escaped from a Colombian jail in 1985 and is considered a key 
dealer for Colombian cocaine barons He lives in Tegucigalpa 
Matta is wanted in the United States in connection with the 1985 
murder in Mexico of Enrique Camarena Salazar a US Drug 
Enforcement Administration agent Honduran law does not allow 
extradition of Honduran citizens 
US officials say the Medellin Cartel named for the Colombian 
city in which it is based is responsible for more than 80 percent 
of the cocaine smuggled into the United States 
Honduran Congressman Roberto Ramon Castillo said Friday the High 
Command should report to Congress on possible drug trafficking 
involving the army The High Command consists of the only general 
on active service and about 55 colonels and lieutenant colonels 
Castillo called on President Jose Azcona Hoyo to investigate 
Mattas activities Azcona heads a civilian government but the 
military wields great power 
The congressman from the opposition National Party suggested 
that representatives of the High Command be called before Congress 
to testify 
He said he would form part of a congressional commission that 
will travel to the United States next week to discuss the 
accusations with US congressmen senators and Reagan 
administration officials 
Radio and television stations and afternoon newspapers reported 
the allegations in the Times article
