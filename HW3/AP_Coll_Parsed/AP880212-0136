The nations deficit in foreign trade stood at a 
lowerthanexpected 122 billion in December while business 
inventories jumped the government said today It also said 
wholesale prices rose a brisk 04 percent in January 
The trade figure was the lowest in 11 months reflecting a surge 
in exports Commerce Department officials said 
For the year the trade deficit widened to a record 1712 
billion the largest ever But financial markets were expected to 
pay more attention to the December numbers which came two months 
after the Oct 19 stock market crash 
Meanwhile the Labor Department said higher food costs more than 
offset declines in energy prices last month easily wiping out a 
04 percent decline in Decembers Producer Price Index 
It was the steepest monthly increase since an identical 04 
percent jump in September and would amount to an annual inflation 
rate of 46 percent if it persisted all year The annual rate of 
increase for all of 1987 was 22 percent 
Analysts still expect that wholesale prices will moderate 
through the balance of 1988 however 
In another report the Commerce Department said business 
inventories shot up 08 percent in December the third consecutive 
large monthly advance 
The December increase pushed unsold stockpiles on shelves and 
backlots up by 545 billion to a seasonally adjusted 70187 
billion The increase followed even larger gains of 09 percent in 
November and 11 percent in October 
While the economy as measured by the gross national product 
expanded at a brisk 42 percent annual rate in the final three 
months of the year nearly threefourths of that growth came from 
an unusually large buildup in inventories which was occurring at 
the same time that consumer spending was falling 
Because of this combination many analysts believe growth in the 
first three months of 1988 will be extremely sluggish with some 
analysts even forecasting one quarter of negative GNP growth 
On Thursday the Commerce Department said retail sales activity 
posted its third monthly increase in January as a rebound in auto 
sales boosted the key economic sector 
Some economists said Januarys 05 percent rise in retail sales 
reflected a continued recovery in consumer confidence that was 
jarred during the October stock market crash 
In addition to the January rise the government revised upward 
the sales gains reported for the two previous months Sales were up 
a strong 12 percent in December and 03 percent in November 
compared with previous estimates of 07 percent and 01 percent 
respectively 
Because consumer spending accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity analysts have been watching it closely for signs 
of a slowdown in the wake of the crash 
But although Januarys gains were supported by a 16 percent 
rise in auto sales some analysts said the figures were strong 
enough to indicate consumers were not dragging the economy into a 
recession 
Sales had declined by a sharp 09 percent in October and 17 
percent in September 
Retail establishments sold 1281 billion worth of goods in 
January up 600 million from December the government said It was 
the highest monthly total since August when sales hit 1289 
billion 
A separate government report indicated severely cold weather 
boosted Americans home heating bills by nearly a halfbillion 
dollars in January 
The survey by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration indicated home heating cost Americans 998 billion 
in January 470 million more than if weather for the month had 
been average 
That means the typical home owner or renter spent 13880 on 
oil gas or electricity to keep warm last month 654 more than 
the bill would have been in a normal January 
Costs vary considerably across the country but bills were above 
normal in every area except the Pacific Coast according to the 
monthly report 
In other economic news on Thursday a selective midwinter review 
of the farm labor situation by the Agriculture Department showed 
there were about 11 percent more hired workers on the job than a 
year ago 
A quarterly report showed about 340000 workers hired by farmers 
were on the job during a survey in the week Jan 1016 compared 
with 307000 a year earlier
