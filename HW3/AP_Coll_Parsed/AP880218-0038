Nevada Republicans scheduled caucuses 
and a presidential straw poll this evening with mainstream GOP 
leaders wondering how many Pat Robertson supporters will turn out 
The nonbinding straw poll is first of its kind for the states 
Republicans and the first in the West this election year 
Republican State Chairwoman Sally VitkusMcKinney said she 
wouldnt predict a winner in the Nevada polling adding that 
backers of George Bush Bob Dole Jack Kemp and Robertson all had 
been working hard to get supporters of their candidates to the 
caucuses 
Ms VitkusMcKinney said she has heard reports that backers of 
Robertson a former television evangelist would try to pack the 
caucuses expected to draw several thousand of about 123000 
Republicans registered to vote in Nevada 
Organizing drives by Robertson backers have proven highly 
successful in several states Robertson finished a surprisingly 
strong second in last weeks Iowa caucuses and his supporters in 
Hawaii nearly doubled the ranks of registered Republicans in 
advance of a straw poll in the state 
Steve Wark state coordinator for Robertson denied his group 
was involved in any caucuspacking adding that his coordinating 
efforts were no different than those of coordinators for other 
candidates 
Were probably the only campaign that isnt packing added 
Wark The others are Thats their strategy 
National GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr a former Reno 
lawyer downplayed the significance of the Nevada presidential 
straw polling saying he didnt think it would indicate 
presidential preferences of Republicans in the West 
It focuses all the attention on who cranks out the most people 
and who gets the most people to the caucuses which really may not 
be representative of the entire Republican Party of any particular 
state said Fahrenkopf 
But Fahrenkopf also said the winner of the straw poll will be 
trumpeting it He said the top votegetters can use the results 
in their moneyraising efforts and to generate more support for 
their races in advance of the March 8 Super Tuesday primary 
balloting around the nation 
Ms VitkusMcKinney who pushed for the straw poll said the 
polling has brought a lot of excitement to politics here in 
Nevada and will bring out four or five times the number of people 
who usually attend GOP caucuses 
The straw poll was developed last summer before former Nevada 
Sen Paul Laxalt announced in September that he wouldnt seek the 
GOP presidential nomination He would have been the probable Nevada 
poll winner had he stayed in the running Ms VitkusMcKinney said 
She also said the straw poll results will reflect views of 
Republicans in many states in the West adding We normally vote 
for the person and we are a conservative state The results will be 
used by the winner for momentum going into Super Tuesday 
The chairwoman also said steps are being taken to guard against 
any caucus participation by people who arent properly registered 
She said anyone who votes illegally could be subject to later 
prosecution 
This is our first go at this so were trying to cover any 
loopholes she said If they lie its a gross misdemeanor
