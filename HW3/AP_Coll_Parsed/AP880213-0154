Few politicians in Massachusetts have more 
interest in the success of Gov Michael S Dukakis presidential 
campaign than the woman who would fill his Statehouse office if he 
captures the White House 
But Lt Gov Evelyn Murphy the first woman ever to hold a 
constitutional office in Massachusetts is neither overwhelmed by 
the prospect of occupying the governors seat nor pressing for that 
power 
Murphy 47 spent eight years day and night seven days a 
week 16 hours a day to get where she is today she said in an 
interview last week By anybodys measure it was a long time to 
get elected 
But for Murphy an economist with a PhD from Duke University 
it was an investment made not so much as a stepping stone to the 
governors office one floor above her own 
I looked at it as a place in which I could show people what I 
could do she said 
Murphy finds herself at a moment that may be unique in the 
history of the illdefined No 2 seat of authority in 
Massachusetts state government 
When she campaigned for the job in 1986 she had to pitch a need 
for the post as much as her ability to fill it John Kerry who had 
defeated her in her first bid for the job in 1982 abandoned the 
office after being elected to the US Senate in 1984 For the next 
two years the office was vacant without much concern to anyone 
Then shortly after she won the lieutenant governorship in 1986 
on a platform of turning the office into a longrange planning arm 
of state government Dukakis launched his White House bid Three 
months into her term Murphy found her job had taken on new 
importance 
When we started out I wasnt quite clear what an acting 
governor does when the governor sets out to be president Murphy 
said Her role has slowly expanded as Dukakis spends more time on 
the campaign trail 
But during her first year Murphy had her own agenda to keep 
She had her Blueprint 2000 project a twoyear series of regional 
hearings statistical analysis and predictions aimed at assessing 
the commonwealths needs into the 21st century and developing 
some very basic simple fundamental directions for the decade 
ahead 
Then there was there requests from groups across the state 
wanting to get a look at the first female lieutenant governor 
There were 1000 requests in the first six months alone she 
said and you feel an obligation to go out and speak because 
people want to see what this thing is all about 
Murphys role as Dukakis surrogate has been eased by the 
philosophic agreement they achieved working together off and on 
over a dozen years first as his environmental affairs secretary 
and later as his economic affairs secretary 
Murphy compared her development as lieutenant governor to 
Dukakis as a presidential candidate 
Michael and I both have the same kind of attitude towards how 
you step into uncharted waters step by step learn from each move 
what else can be taken over
