When the FBI infiltrated a group of opponents 
of President Reagans Central America policies it suspected they 
were behind the stillunsolved November 1983 bombing of the US 
Capitol 
Secret FBI files made available under the Freedom of Information 
Act show that for up to five years the bureau looked for links 
between the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador 
and a number of terrorist acts It found none 
CISPES contends the investigation was really based on its 
opposition to administration policies in El Salvador and elsewhere 
in Central America The FBI denies it 
FBI files also reveal the bureau was investigating whether 
CIPSES was considering any violent activities at the 1984 Olympics 
in Los Angeles or the 1984 political conventions or whether it had 
any connection with the May 1983 bombing at the Army National War 
College in Washington 
One document said some of those interviewed in the investigation 
were told the FBI was checking into bombings of federal buildings 
and facilities of defense contractors 
The documents were among some 2000 pages of FBI records on 
investigation of the El Salvador group released under the Freedom 
of Information Act Large portions of the requested documents were 
either blacked out by government censors or withheld entirely 
References to the bombings were the only indications of what the 
FBI was seeking in its investigations 
The suit was filed on behalf of CISPES by the New York 
Citybased Center for Constitutional Rights 
Beth Perry CISPES spokeswoman called the allegations that the 
group had a connection to the US Capitol bombing or the bombing 
at the War College absolutely ridiculous 
She said some literature on the Capitol bombing was passed out 
at a CISPESsponsored demonstration on Nov 12 five days after the 
bombing but that the group had nothing to do with distributing 
that material 
Asked about any plans for violence at the 1984 conventions or 
Olympics she said the FBI called the national office of CISPES to 
ask what the group planned 
CISPES referred the FBI agent to its lawyer who told the agent 
that local groups might be planning peaceful demonstrations but no 
national effort was planned 
One of the FBI documents said the Dallas field office received 
copies of literature produced by CISPES at a demonstration on Nov 
12 1983 five days after the bombing 
Among this literature was the Armed Resistance Units 
communique claiming responsibility for the 11783 bombing of the 
Capitol building the document said 
The bomb severely damaged a corridor and lounge outside the 
Senate chamber The same organization name was used by those who 
placed the May 1983 bomb outside the Army War College at Fort 
McNair 
Another document said although not CISPES literature the 
communique claiming responsibility for the 11783 bombing of the 
US Capitol building was passed out along with the CISPES 
literature 
A document on the Fort McNair bombing said an unidentified 
individual contacted a local radio station in Washington DC a 
few days after the bombing and said We are in Solidarity with 
the People of El Salvador and Guatemala and have taken action 
because people are trained at the NWC National War College 
In another document FBI agents were told Determine extent 
and nature of CISPES involvement in organizingsupporting terrorist 
activities within the United States with particular attention 
placed on the forthcoming political conventions and 1984 Olympic 
games 
FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney denied the investigation was 
political saying it had a narrow focus and was limited to those 
leaders and key members of CISPES to ascertain if they were 
involved in illegal support of the FMLN a foreign terrorist 
organization 
The FMLN is the Frente Farabundo Marti Para La Liberacion 
Nacional a resistance group fighting the USbacked government of 
El Salvador 
Field offices were instructed not to interfere with First 
Amendment rights of CISPES members he said
