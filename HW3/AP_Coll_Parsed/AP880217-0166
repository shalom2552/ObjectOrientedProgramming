Federal authorities are seeking a fugitive who 
fled to Greece after allegedly stealing three valuable paintings 
from a wealthy family and arranging to have them sold by a New York 
auction house 
The paintings were recovered after they were auctioned but 
before they were shipped to the buyers 
A federal grand jury last week indicted John Zentefis a former 
foreman at a Chicago storage warehouse in the thefts from heiress 
Mary Bates Harrington 
The paintings Summer Montclair by George Inness End of 
Day by Jean C Cazin and River Landscape by Alexander H 
Wyant were once owned by Chicago coal magnate George Bates 
Harrington and his wife Sophia 
Harrington died in 1960 and his wife died in 1963 The paintings 
were inherited by Ms Harrington who placed them in storage at a 
Federal Moving and Storage Co warehouse in Chicago 
Zentefis worked at warehouse according to the indictment In 
1979 Federal Moving and Storage went bankrupt and the boxes were 
supposed to be transferred to the warehouse of a different company 
In 1984 a friend of the Harrington family noticed that 
Summer Montclair a 100yearold landscape painting had been 
listed in a circular sent out by Sothebys the wellknown auction 
house The FBI was notified and agent Robert Spiel was dispatched 
to New York according to the indictment 
Spiel found that Summer Montclair had been auctioned to an 
unidentified London man for 90750 The other two paintings had 
been sold to other buyers for a total of 4375 
Zentefis received 76000 and fled to Greece the indictment 
alleged while Sothebys kept the rest of the money as a commission 
Spiel confiscated the still unshipped art works and brought them 
back to Chicago where the paintings are now being held in storage 
by the Art Institute of Chicago 
Assistant US Attorney Alex Vesselinovitch began a grand jury 
investigation and the family hired attorney Gordon Nash to sort out 
the affair 
Eventually Sothebys paid back the disgruntled purchasers of 
the works which a Cook County judge said belong to Ms Harrington 
Its amazing we found them she said
