Two US Navy warships which US 
officials said were bumped by Soviet vessels in the Black Sea last 
week passed through the Bosporus Strait today bound for the 
Mediterranean port sources reported 
The sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
destroyer Caron and the cruiser Yorktown crossed the Bosporus about 
730 am 
The ships have to cross the Dardanelles Strait before heading 
into the Aegean Sea and then into the Mediterranean 
The US Defense Department said two Soviet frigates 
intentionally bumped the US vessels Friday as they were 
conducting routine operations and exercising their internationally 
recognized right of innocent passage 
The Soviets said the collision took place as a result of 
dangerous maneuvers by the US warships
