A disparaging word about Chiles 
military government seldom is heard in the homes on the range of 
rugged Patagonian 
More than 1300 miles removed from the political machinations of 
Santiago the nations capital inhabitants say they prefer 
progress to protest 
And many are quick to credit President Augusto Pinochet the 
rightwing army general with bringing the 20th century to the 
isolated southern region where even the relatively young recall 
when hitching posts lined the streets 
He is a great man proclaimed Amalia Chible standing in the 
sunlit living room of her roadside home and restaurant about 70 
miles south of Coyhaique the regions capital 
On the wall hangs a color photograph of Pinochet broadly 
smiling from behind his presidential desk It is handsigned 
Affectionately yours 
Support for the army commander who seized power in a 1973 coup 
is considered stronger in Chiles rural provinces than in the big 
cities where the political opposition is most active But nowhere 
is it stronger than in Chilean Patagonia 
The reason lies outside Mrs Chibles door an unpaved but 
welltended road that the government calls the Great Southern 
Highway 
The twolane road winds along the southern Andes for some 350 
miles through mountains forests and sheep ranches Still under 
construction it was started by Pinochets administration He 
considers it one of his most important public works and each year 
proudly comes to officially open a new stretch 
People cried with joy when the road came through Mrs 
Chible who is about 50 told a visitor Before life was 
terrible Now the wool gets out and life is rich 
Abel Avedano a horsecart operator agreed calling the road 
one of the great works of the president Youve go to give 
him that 
Cut off from the rest of the country by deep fiords towering 
mountains and glaciers Patagonia remained virtually uninhabited 
for a long time after Chile achieved independence from Spain in 
1810 It was notorious for blustery weather yearround with winter 
temperatures dipping to 20 below zero 
Settlers began trickling in when in the early 1900s the 
government handed out tracts of land to sheep ranchers 
Coyhaique was founded just 50 years ago and until recently was 
little more than a place where ranch hands came to get drunk on pay 
day 
The people were fairly roughedged recalls Mario Miranda 
an art historian who was born in Coyhaique in 1951 
He recalls as a child seeing a cowboy ride his horse down the 
narrow hallway of the local hotel firing a sixshooter into the 
ceiling 
The guests who were sleeping just above were terrified 
Miranda said It was quite a scandal 
Then came the highway and with it new settlers supermarkets 
department stores Jeeps pickup trucks and even taxis have 
replaced horsecarts on the downtown streets At the airport where 
an aging cargo plane used to land just once a week modern 
passenger jetliners arrive daily with businessmen and tourists 
We went from the hitching post to video clubs practically 
overnight Miranda said 
Employed by the state education departments division of 
culture Miranda is anxious to preserve some of the settlers 
traditions such as working with leather and wool Its rapidly 
becoming contaminated by the contact with outside with Santiago 
Many of the traditions came from Argentina through the mountain 
passes that once were the only way in and out of Chilean Patagonia 
Political relations between the neighboring countries often have 
been tense and a territorial dispute brought them to the brink of 
war in 1978 Pinochets efforts to develop and populate the region 
are seen at least in part as an effort to protect it from 
invasion 
Recent waves of nationalism have diluted the areas Argentine 
flavor Chilean cowboy songs and dances replaced those of the 
Argentine gaucho and the Argentine habit of drinking tea from a 
hollow gourd became less popular 
Francisco Mena an anthropologist who works with Miranda said 
that in outlying villages and farms many of the old customs are 
preserved 
People spin their own wool weave their own ponchos and make 
their own riding tack from leather they themselves have tanned 
he said 
But many have left Patagonia to sign on for ranch work in the 
US West Some come back when their threeyear contracts are up 
Others having developed a taste for American living dont
