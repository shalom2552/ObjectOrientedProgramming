US industrial production edged up 02 
percent in January despite big declines in auto production and 
steel the government said Wednesday 
The Federal Reserve Board said that the January increase was 
just half the 04 percent gain recorded in both November and 
December 
Private analysts said this slower growth was consistent with 
their view that the economy will slow considerably in the early 
part of 1988 as businesses work off a backlog of unsold inventories 
built up during the final three months of 1987 
Strength in domestic production helped push the overall economy 
as measured by the gross national product to a robust annual 
growth rate of 42 percent from October through December However 
nearly threefourths of that strength went into inventories rather 
than final sales 
Analysts said this backlog will have to be worked off in coming 
months and will translate into an extremely sluggish economy in the 
first three months of this year 
Lawrence Chimerine president of the WEFA Group a private 
forecasting firm said that the smaller rise in industrial 
production was consistent with this view 
We are seeing a slowdown in domestic demand not only for 
cars but other consumer durables and this will hold down 
industrial production even though we are getting some offsetting 
strength from stronger export sales he said 
Some economists are predicting GNP growth could be an actual 
negative number from January though March but most expect growth 
will resume in the spring keeping the country out of a recession 
We are seeing that while the economy is slowing down things 
are not stopping We think we will have sluggish growth in the 
first half of the year but no recession said David Wyss senior 
financial economist at Data Resources Inc of Lexington Mass 
The January increase in industrial production the fourth in a 
row left output 6 percent above where it was a year ago providing 
further evidence of the rebound manufacturers are enjoying as the 
weaker dollar boosts US exports to record levels 
The Reagan administration is counting on the export strength to 
keep the country out of a recession this year 
Output in the manufacturing sector rose 02 percent in January 
following a much larger 05 percent December advance 
The strength came from industries producing nondurable goods 
where production rose by 04 percent 
Output of durable goods items expected to last at least three 
years showed no change at all in January 
Production of cars fell by 74 percent in January to an annual 
rate of 65 million units The impact of this fall was offset in 
part however by an increase in production of light trucks and 
minivans which have now captured about onethird of the US 
consumer market 
Also contributing to the weakness last month was a decline in 
iron and steel production which fell back following a sharp rise 
in December 
The mining industry suffered a 06 percent drop in January the 
second consecutive monthly downturn This sector which includes 
oil and gas well drilling has been battered by depressed 
conditions caused by falling world energy prices 
The utility sector had a big 13 percent increase in January 
reflecting colderthannormal weather which drove up the use of 
electricity and natural gas 
The various changes left the industrial production index at 
1338 percent of its 1977 base of 100
