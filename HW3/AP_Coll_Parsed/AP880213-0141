For the first time in nearly three decades the 
name Henry Maier will be missing from the ballot when Milwaukee 
voters choose their mayor 
Maier 70 has held the office since 1960 longer than any other 
big city mayor in the country But residents will see fresher faces 
when the city holds its primary vote Tuesday 
It has been forgotten that I said the president is too damn 
old to be president at 70 Maier said last June when he announced 
he would not seek reelection And I believed that then and I 
believe that now and I think its true of me 
Former Acting Gov Martin Schreiber and state Sen John Norquist 
are the leading contenders in the nonpartisan race to fill Maiers 
job 
When asked to list his accomplishments Maier points to the 
citys revitalized downtown the annual Summerfest which the mayor 
once called the Super Bowl of festivals and a fiscal policy 
that has given Milwaukee an AAbond rating 
He has cultivated a folksy image with his public singalongs at 
Summerfest and other events and the annual Christmas tree lighting 
But Maier also has a feisty reputation He has been combative 
with the local press has criticized the federal government for 
cutting aid to cities and has blamed suburbs for not sharing their 
wealth and causing many of the citys problems with poverty 
For the average Joe in Milwaukee he needs a mayor whose 
image is supportive to lean on Maier said in a 1983 interview 
He has to feel he has a champion someone who is representing him 
vigorously willing to stand and fight 
But some community leaders say Maier has not done enough to help 
the citys black population Statistics released last fall by the 
Milwaukee Urban League show Milwaukee is the most segregated major 
metropolitan area in the country and more than 40 percent of the 
citys black children live in poverty 
Some black leaders complain that the stability of Maiers 28 
years has led to stagnation in addressing inner city issues 
The city hasnt done much with what we wanted said Felmers 
Chaney president of the Milwaukee chapter of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People 
Maybe Maier did the best he could I dont know Chaney 
said Whoever takes his job now needs to come out with a firmer 
stand 
Maier however has demonstrated support from blacks and the 
population as a whole 
He repeatedly has dismissed notions of seeking higher office at 
the state capital or in Washington 
In 1984 just before being reelected for the last time Maier 
said I have never wanted to go to Madison I have never wanted 
to go to Washington I have never wanted to leave the soil of this 
city
