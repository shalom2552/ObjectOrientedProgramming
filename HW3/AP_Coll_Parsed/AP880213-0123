After 75 years love still blooms for 
Charles and Fannie Forespring 
The couple who eloped on Valentines Day in 1913 after their 
parents told them they were too young to marry have been 
inseparable since their wedding living a rather quiet life in 
Somerset County 
We had our fights But we never stayed mad at each other 
said Forespring 94 Im the kind of person who cant stay mad at 
people even my wife 
The couple moved into the White Star Residence in Jennerstown 
two years ago after living various places in Somerset County They 
have four children 16 grandchildren and 20 greatgrandchildren 
Forespring was a member of the New Centerville country band when 
he met his future wife while playing at a Memorial Day service But 
he had trouble getting past her father when he tried to call on her 
at her home in Berlin 
My father wasnt too pleased said Mrs Forespring 93 He 
told me we were too young to be getting serious 
She said her family also was opposed to the marriage because she 
was needed at home 
I quit high school in my senior year and went to work for a 
dentist We had a large family and needed the money she said 
After dating for several months the two decided they couldnt 
wait 
We devised a plan Forespring said On Fridays when Fannie 
was visiting with her aunt and uncle her uncle would take her to 
the railroad station in Rockwood on his sleigh and put her on the 
train 
But on Friday afternoon Feb 14 1913 Forespring was waiting 
in the hotel across from the railroad station and hopped the train 
We made our way to Cumberland Md We were sure a preacher 
friend of her family would marry us he said Somewhere along 
the way I really dont remember we obtained a marriage license 
Mrs Forespring said a Rev Styles who had been pastor of the 
Reformed Church in Berlin agreed to perform the ceremony 
We were married stayed overnight in Cumberland and the next 
day headed back to New Centerville Forespring said Monday 
morning I was back at my job as a teamster with the Atlantic 
Refining Co 
Mrs Forespring said there are days when she feels like shes 16 
and times when she feels her age 
I never let my age bother me she said Why I just gave 
up driving a car four or five years ago
