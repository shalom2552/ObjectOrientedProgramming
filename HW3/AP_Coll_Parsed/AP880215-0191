No one knows how large the underground economy 
is but it functions in countries throughout the world at 
considerable direct and indirect costs according to a new study 
Under the table and off the books millions of persons 
worldwide are engaged in jobs that evade the relevant tax and labor 
laws frequently with an official scowl but a tacit wink from 
their governments says the report released Monday by Johns 
Hopkins University 
Titled The Informal Economy Studies in Advanced and Less 
Developed Countries it includes essays by 19 authors from Italy 
Spain Uruguay and Bolivia as well as the United States 
One author estimates the size of the underground economy at 44 
percent another 10 percent another 33 percent of total 
production The size also varies by place and industry 
Negative consequences of the underground process are endured 
not only by workers who must cope with low wages insecure jobs 
and lack of occupational safeguards but also by entire 
industries they say 
Bolivian cocaine processors Soviet vodka distillers and 
thousands of New York unregistered cabdrivers are all considered 
part of a growing underground world economy that the says skews 
statistics as well as producing huge unreported and untaxed profits 
Whatever the amount the underground activity rarely if ever 
shows up on the official statistics used by nations and world 
organizations in making crucial economic policy decisions 
A decade ago the size of the underground economy in New York 
City alone was estimated at more than 16 billion 
Saskia SassenKoob director of the urban planning program at 
Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Architecture and Planning 
says a survey in 1981 of four blocks in Manhattan found 90 percent 
of all interior construction being done without permits She 
estimates that there are 21000 gypsy taxicabs not licensed by 
the city twice the number of legal cabs 
A study based on a survey of 1000 recent Soviet immigrants to 
the United States estimates that in Soviet cities of the late 
1970s 40 percent of the households received more than a quarter of 
their income from informal activities These ranged from 
distilling vodka to market gardening and from bootleg medical 
services to repairing private cars with parts stolen from 
government garages according to former residents 
In Latin America about 40 percent of the workforce is believed 
to be informally employed the editors say
