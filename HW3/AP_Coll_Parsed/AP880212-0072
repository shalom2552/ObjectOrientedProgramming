Doc Whitehead is a yapping yuppie a 14monthold 
lakeland terrier whose paw print carries purchasing power 
His owners Kenneth and Susan Whitehead gave him his own bank 
account and the distinctive pawprint signature has paid for a 
parking ticket and a custommade dog tag 
Doc got his picture in the London Standard newspaper on Friday 
along with a photo of one of his checks 
The paper said Garrard the crown jewelers in London accepted 
Docs 575pound 10 check in payment for the dog tag 
Normally we would not accept a check from a new client who is 
a minor the jeweler was quoted as telling the Whiteheads 
However we are prepared to accept your personal guarantee of 
Docs creditworthiness 
Mrs Whitehead was quoted as saying that Doc got account at the 
Westminster Bank branch in Southall west London so he could buy 
his own toys but he had to pay a parking ticket while out 
shopping 
Doc was responsible for us parking where we did so when we 
got a ticket he paid the penalty she was quoted as saying 
The check was initially sent back with a note saying there was no 
signature but when I pointed out that the paw print was the 
signature there was no problem
