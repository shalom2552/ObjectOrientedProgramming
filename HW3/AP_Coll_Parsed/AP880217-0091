The Federal Aviation Administration wants all 
aircraft operating near 254 of the nations airports to have 
devices that automatically inform air traffic controllers of a 
planes altitude 
The devices called Mode C transponders are already required on 
commercial aircraft The regulation proposed Tuesday would affect 
private planes operating within 40 miles of the designated airports 
The regulation would also require all aircraft operating at 
6000 feet or move above the surface in controlled airspace to 
carry the transponders 
FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said increased use of the 
devices would ease the burden on controllers and reduce the 
potential for collisions and close encounters between planes 
By taking advantage of the existing aviation technology this 
rule if adopted will provide a significant enhancement to the 
safety of our nations flying public McArtor said 
The proposed rule would implement legislation passed by Congress 
to require expanded use of the transponders 
The FAA now requires the transponders for aircraft operating at 
12500 feet or more above sea level and in socalled terminal 
control areas around the nations 23busiest airports Last June 
the agency proposed a rule requiring Mode C transponders for 
aircraft operating within 30 miles of such airports 
The FAA said increased use of the transponders allows the 
display of altitude information on an air traffic controllers 
radar screen can warn controllers of possible conflicts provide 
lowaltitude warnings and activate a collisionavoidance system in 
aircraft that have such a system 
The proposed rule will be open to public comment through March 
28
