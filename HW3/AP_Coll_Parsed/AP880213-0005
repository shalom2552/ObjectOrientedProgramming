A drab Lutheran church in East Berlin has become 
the headquarters of a grassroots movement aimed at forcing reform 
upon the countrys aging and authoritarian Communist leadership 
But unlike dissident movements of the past the Lutheran 
movement has found itself looking more East than West for 
inspiration on how to change Eastern Europes most industrialized 
country 
We want to change the system from within We need to get some 
glasnost here a leading church member Hans Mayer said in 
reference to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevs policy of openness 
and reform 
You can only get democracy when you fight for it said 
Mayer who used an alias to protect himself from official reprisals 
While the Zion Church is the headquarters and focal point for 
the reform movement other Lutheran churches in East Berlin also 
have become rallying places for young adults seeking change 
Dissidents were thrust into international attention after an 
official rally led by East German leader Erich Honecker on Jan 17 
to honor German Communist Party founders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl 
Liebknecht 
Members of the Zion Church tried to join the rally in a protest 
action against the nations leadership 
At least 100 dissidents were arrested and more than 60 of them 
have since been expelled to West Germany The rest have also been 
released from East German jails 
The Zion Church which is located only about two blocks from the 
Berlin Wall turned into a magnet of dissent last year when its 
outspoken followers mostly between the ages of 20 to 35 began 
calling for more human rights and democracy in East Germany 
There are no official estimates on the number of active 
dissidents gathering in East Berlins 90 Lutheran churches but 
informed sources put the number at several thousand 
Another of the churches is the Church of Faith located near East 
Germanys secret police headquarters 
Although the movement has been gaining strength since at least 
1983 it was galvanized by two events in the Soviet Union 
Gorbachevs rise to power in 1985 and the Chernobyl nuclear fire in 
1986 
Gorbachevs policies which call for some decentralization of 
economic and political life have been hailed by East German 
dissidents as the first good thing to come from the Soviet Union in 
decades 
While an international disaster the April 1986 Chernobyl fire 
has also had its political uses alllowing those concerned with 
ecological issues to rally around an issue 
Chernobyl was the biggest boost for the movement said Karl 
Wegner another church member who also used an alias to avoid 
police harassment 
People interested in ecological questions started to go to 
meetings in church basements because they soon found out the 
church reacted to their demand for a room he said 
Incidents in East Germany have further aided the movement 
On Oct 17 a group of about 20 skinheads disenchanted 
rightist youths raided a rock concert in the Zion Church and beat 
up concertgoers with bicycle chains and clubs 
Some sources say East German authorities fomented the attack 
while East Germany claims provocateurs from West Berlin were 
involved 
After the battle of Zion things really got hot here said 
Mayer speeking in the sleet near the 115yearold church 
But things could get hotter 
Party leader Honecker indicated Friday that East Germany wont 
copy reforms being implemented in the Soviet Union 
Of course we follow developments in the Soviet Union and the 
other socialist countries very closely Honecker said in a speech 
to party officials carried on the staterun news agency ADN But 
that does not necessarily mean we intend to copy them 
Such a lack of tolerance could mean more crackdowns 
Mayer says millions of East Germans watching West German 
televiion have followed the progress of the dissident movement 
Thats led to an inundation of queries from people who simply want 
to leave and are looking for advice 
But Mayer said his group does not want to become too involved 
with those people His concern is with those who have to stay 
At the Zion church the movements resources are meager a 
10footby14foot room in a parish building and a basement 
ecology library 
About 1000 books line the shelves of the small windowless 
library Next to Joseph Stalins Thoughts on Leninism is a copy 
of the officially banned West Berlin newspaper Tageszeitung 
East Germany police raided the library in November confiscating 
duplicating machines and publications critical of government 
policies 
That raid resulted in 21 arrests and dissident groups staged 
peaceful demonstrations several days running at Zion and other East 
Berlin churches until their comrades were released from prison 
Upon leaving the building Wegner pointed down the street at two 
dourlooking police officers 
Never mind them he says Theyre always here
