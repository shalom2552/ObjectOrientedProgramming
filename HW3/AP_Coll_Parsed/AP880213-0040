Many foods contain very high levels of natural 
cancercausing agents suggesting that intense efforts to control 
industrial carcinogens may be misplaced a researcher said 
Apples for example contain high levels of formaldehyde which 
is considered to be a potent carcinogen said Bruce Ames chairman 
of the biochemistry department at the University of California 
Berkeley 
Broccoli contains a substantial amount of a substance that is 
chemically similar to dioxin Peanut butter is unavoidably 
contaminated with a fungus that is highly carcinogenic 
Does that mean were being done in by vegetables Well thats 
what the reality is turning out to be Ames said Friday at the 
annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science 
Ames said he does not in fact believe that the cancercausing 
agents in food are causing us harm because we have evolved to 
defend ourselves against those agents 
He believes however that the defenses we have evolved also 
protect us against industrial carcinogens which cause cancer in 
the same ways as do natural carcinogens 
Peter Preuss director of the Office of Health and Environmental 
Assessment at the US Environmental Protection Agency said I 
think theres a great deal of importance in what Professor Ames 
said 
He was critical however of many of Amess calculations 
While the idea is important Im disturbed by the details I 
think theres a lot of rigor that has to be introduced into that 
science before its accepted 
He noted for example that the dioxinlike substance in 
broccoli might act differently than dioxin There are a lot of 
things that are like that but nevertheless dioxin is unique 
he said 
Ames said most of the natural carcinogens in plants evolved as a 
natural defense mechanism 
Plants dont have teeth they dont have claws they cant run 
away he said All plant evolution is plants developing new and 
better toxins to fight off predators 
Ames began his talk by saying that the world is full of 
carcinogens but that they are not as harmful as people believe 
One line of evidence to support that he said is that with a 
few exceptions rates of cancer have not increased in the 
industrial era 
Except for lung cancer which is due to cigarette smoking 
rates of cancer are staying steady or going down he said 
While that is true for some cancers Preuss said others have 
gone up They include melanoma lymphoma and cancer of the testes 
prostate and kidney 
Ames was critical of the use of rats and mice to test whether 
substances are carcinogenic Its reasonable to think that 
chemicals that are carcinogens in mice and rats would be 
carcinogens in people but the hook is at that dose 
Rats are given the maximum dose that wont poison them he said 
but such doses can kill cells in the body and may lead to cancer 
simply through the disruption they cause If that were the case 
the substances would not be expected to cause cancer at the low 
doses that humans might be exposed to he said 
Ames is the developer of an alternative test that uses bacteria 
to identify possible carcinogens 
Ames presented dozens of examples of carcinogens in plants 
Celery for example contains psoralens which become carcinogenic 
when exposed to light The levels are so high that celery pickers 
often develop a rash on their hands and arms as a result Ames said 
Potatoes have high levels of solanine and chaconine which block 
the action of a human enzyme called cholinesterase he said 
Organophosphate pesticides are considered dangerous said Ames 
because they do the same thing block cholinesterase
