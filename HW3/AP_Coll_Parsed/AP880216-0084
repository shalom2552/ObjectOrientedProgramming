Bob Dole dueled George Bush for Republican 
advantage Tuesday in New Hampshires kickoff presidential primary 
while Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis bid for a decisive victory 
in the Democratic struggle for supremacy and survival 
The first returns as always came from tiny Dixville Notch 
which gave 11 votes of hope to Vice President Bush and 6 to Dole 
Seven Notchers went Democrat split 4to3 between secondplace 
contenders Rep Richard Gephardt and Sen Paul Simon 
Preelection polls said the GOP race was a tossup with Kansas 
Sen Dole propelled by victory in last weeks Iowa caucuses and 
Bush struggling to rebound from a disappointing thirdplace finish 
there 
Rep Jack Kemp and former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont their 
candidacies at stake bid for third place against Pat Robertson in 
the first test for the former television evangelist in a primary 
election 
To a man they said New Hampshire voters would deliver a surprise 
Its going to be an interesting contest Robertson said 
during a chance electionmorning encounter with Simon I met 
three of em that voted for me early so I hope that holds 
Dukakis rivals conceded him a victory in advance They vied for 
second place and hoped to deny the Massachusetts governor a huge 
victory that would give him a boost for the delegaterich contests 
ahead 
Sen Albert Gore Jr Jesse Jackson onetime frontrunner Gary 
Hart and Bruce Babbitt were back in the pack in the New Hampshire 
surveys with Babbitt and Hart hoping to avoid a drubbing that 
would doom their campaigns 
Gephardt and Simon who finished onetwo in Iowa and just ahead 
of Dukakis engaged one another in an angry fight over some Simon 
TV ads critical of Gephardts voting record 
Were gonna run very well Simon said Tuesday morning as he 
aimed to upend the Missouri congressman and further scramble the 
wideopen Democratic race 
Dukakis cautioned Anything can happen New Hampshire voters 
are very independent but he was confident enough to talk about 
his plans for March 8 when 20 states including 14 Southern or 
border states will hold Super Tuesday primaries or caucuses 
Were going to contest every one of those states Dukakis 
said I think were going to surprise some people in the South 
In terms of delegates New Hampshire was small stakes indeed 
Democrats were allotting 18 of their 22 delegates to the national 
convention next summer with 23 spots at stake on the Republican 
side 
But it wasnt delegates that drew the candidates and their 
television advertising dollars to a sparsely settled state with a 
reputation for upsetting frontrunners and elevating upstarts It 
was the prospect of momentum and the ability to attract campaign 
funds needed next month 
Then again as New Hampshire boosters never tire of pointing 
out no one has ever won the White House without a victory in the 
firstinthenation primary since the Granite State started going 
first in 1952 
There was every reason to believe that for some the first 
primary would also be the last 
Babbitt conceded that New Hampshire voters had power of life and 
death over his quest Others were less direct though Kemp and du 
Pont were locked in a struggle with each other and Robertson to 
emerge as a conservative alternative to the frontrunners 
Dukakis the favorite son had a different concern His aides 
pointed out that the largest margin in history for a contest of 
this sort was 11 percentage points 
And they worried aloud about winners in past Democratic 
primaries in New Hampshire being viewed as losers because they did 
worse that expected Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and Edmund Muskie four 
years later
