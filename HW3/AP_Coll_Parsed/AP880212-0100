Highly efficient and obedient robots have 
replaced workers who used to shout strike slogans and have helped 
Fiat vault from financial gloom in the 1970s to a leadership role 
in the worlds auto industry 
The task of turning a deficitburdened company faced with high 
absenteeism and low productivity into a vanguard highly 
profitable enterprise took nearly 10 years and required massive 
annual investments of about 830 million 
At one point the Italian automaker turned to Col Moammar 
Gadhafis Libya for money but in a sign of financial health it 
bought back Libyas minority share a decade later and avoided a 
threat to defense contracts from the United States 
The era of robotics took a heavy toll on the work force 
Employment at Fiat auto was cut by nearly half to 72000 workers 
by the end of 1987 from 138000 nine years earlier according to 
figures given by Italian trade unions to The Associated Press 
By increasing automation Fiat improved productivity and reduced 
costs ushering in a period of high profit that allowed the Agnelli 
family which controls the company to expand its financial empire 
into telecommunications insurance banking and retailing 
Vittorio Ghidella who became the managing director of Fiats 
auto division in 1978 and Cesare Romiti who took over as managing 
director of the Fiat group a year later are unanimously considered 
the architects of the groups impressive recovery 
Given a free hand by Chairman Giovanni Agnelli whose family has 
been the controlling Fiat shareholder since his grandfather founded 
the Turinbased company in 1899 Ghidella and Romiti set Fiats 
course through the end of this century after subduing the tough 
opposition of the metalworkers union 
Through temporary layoffs of 24000 workers and the dismissal of 
61 involved in acts of violence and sabotage inside the factories 
during disruptive walkouts in 197980 Fiat regained control of 
the plants and on production Carlo Besuzzo head of Fiats work 
planning said in an interview with The Associated Press 
A march by 40000 foremen and white collar workers supporting 
Fiats policy helped end 35 days of strikes in 1980 and foiled a 
possible occupation of the plants threatened by the most radical 
groups of strikers who were openly supported by the Communist 
Party 
During the most difficult years of labor tensions worsened by a 
drop in demand in the wake of the world oil crisis Fiat was 
burdened with unsold stocks of about 500000 cars while absenteeism 
ranged from 15 percent to 20 percent 
Ironically it was in large part the mounting opposition of 
trade unions to the traditional and stressful assembly line work 
that drove Fiat toward heavy investments in computers and robots 
It was a dramatic but unavoidable choice said Besuzzo 
Fiat was the first European auto company to brave the risks of 
heavy investment in automation The result was a less expensive and 
better product and after some years an impressive economic 
improvement 
At present the Fiat group relies on 1550 auto robots or about 
half the total robots in use in Italy and Besuzzo says there is 
more room for even more advanced automation in the Fiat plants 
For sure we have a technological leadership over Japanese and 
US makers in flexible robotized lines which can assemble parts 
of different models Robots in the spray painting division could 
soon cover 60 percent of the production up from 40 percent while 
the percentage of robotized work in assembling parts would rise to 
25 from 3 percent he said 
Many of the robotic systems have been supplied by Fiats factory 
automation unit Comau which has also sold systems to major 
European and American auto makers including Ford and General 
Motors 
The Tipo the latest midsized model which is expected to boost 
Fiats ambitions of becoming Europes No1 automaker at the expense 
of West Germanys Volkswagen is being assembled in the factory at 
Cassino which is Europes most automated 
The model unveiled Jan 26 has a competitive price in 
comparision with European models of the same class It required the 
most expensive investment for a Fiat model nearly 16 billion 
However investment in automation has produced highly successful 
returns so far 
Since the beginning of the decade the Fiat group has nearly 
doubled net income from one year to the next
