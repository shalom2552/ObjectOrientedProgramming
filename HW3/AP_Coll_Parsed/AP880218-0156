A caller today claimed the Islamic 
Revolutionary Brigades kidnapped a US Marine officer and accused 
the officer of being a CIA agent 
The Arabicspeaking man in a telephone call to a Western news 
agency said the previously unknown group took Marine Lt Col 
William R Higgins out of Beirut after he was brought out from 
the south 
UN officials and Shiite Moslem militiamen staged a massive 
search for Higgins throughout south Lebanon and virtually sealed 
off the area around Tyre 50 miles south of Beirut 
In Washington President Reagan said he wants to rescue Higgins 
but he offered no details Were doing everything we can he 
said at a photo session Were trying to find out as much as we 
can Were trying to get him located and certainly we want to 
rescue him 
But later State Department spokesman Charles E Redman said 
I think the president is making a reference there to all of our 
efforts to stay in touch with parties in the region with the 
United Nations to explore every possibility to see if Colonel 
Higgins can be safely returned 
In Louisville Ky Higgins father William F Higgins 72 
died of heart failure said Donna Hazle spokeswoman for Humana 
Hospital Audubon 
Gunmen on Wednesday blocked the coastal highway near Tyre and 
grabbed Higgins as he returned from a meeting with officials of 
Justice Minister Nabih Berris Shiite Amal militia Abdel Majid 
Saleh an Amal political leader said he and Higgins had discussed 
efforts to free foreign hostages in Lebanon in addition to other 
topics at the Tyre meeting 
Higgins was serving as chief of an observer group attached to 
the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon 
State Department spokesman Charles E Redman said the United 
States would continue supplying soldiers for the observer group but 
declined to say if any new instructions would be sent to the 
Americans 
The caller said William Higgins has joined the hostages He 
will only come out after he is tried on grounds that he is one of 
the directors of the CIA in south Lebanon Higgins is now out of 
Beirut after he was brought out from the south 
The caller said a written statement and a photograph of the 
captive will be issued soon Then he hung up 
There was no way to authenticate the claim immediately 
The proIranian groups Islamic Jihad Islamic Jihad for the 
Liberation of Palestine Revolutionary Justice and Holy Warriors 
have claimed responsibility for kidnapping 23 of the other 24 
foreign hostages in Lebanon No one has claimed responsibility for 
the disappearance of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite 
UN helicopters took off at dawn to join the search for Higgins 
but were grounded early today by heavy rain Troops of the UN 
Interim Force in Lebanon known as UNIFIL and the Amal militia 
the dominant force in the region searched together through the 
night 
The militia teamed up with UNIFIL to search for Higgins a 
native of Danville Ky soon after he was kidnapped 
We hope the kidnappers will have no chance of slipping out 
with their captive Thats why all exits have been blocked an 
Amal spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
Plainclothes militia security men in cars blocked roads along 
the Litani River from the Mediterranean coast 25 miles inland to 
the slopes of Mount Hermon 
Uniformed militiamen armed with submachine guns and 
rocketpropelled grenade launchers patrolled a 12mile stretch of 
the coast from the Qassmieh Bridge north of Tyre to the scene of 
the abduction 
Our men are searching villages in a 300squaremile area 
north east and south of Tyre said Daoud Daoud Amals military 
commander in south Lebanon UN troops are blocking the southern 
exits 
Daoud met today with UNIFIL commanders at the Lebanese Armys 
Tyre barracks to coordinate the search He told The Associated 
Press as he went into the meeting Were capable of confronting 
the people whove carried out the abduction if need be But I hope 
a quick happy ending will be accomplished 
Security sources said French specialists were dispatched to Tyre 
from UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura to interrogate an unidentified 
Lebanese bus driver who claimed he witnessed the abduction 
The French have managed to draw a face sketch of the gunman 
the eyewitness says he saw pointing a pistol at Higgins head as he 
forced him into the kidnappers car said one source speaking on 
condition of anonymity

since Jan 8 The group made up of officers from 16 countries is 
attached to the 5800man UNIFIL deployed in south Lebanon since 
1978 to police the border with Israel

frequently have been caught in cross fire between Israeli troops on 
one hand and Palestinian guerrillas and Iranianbacked Shiite 
extremists on the other
