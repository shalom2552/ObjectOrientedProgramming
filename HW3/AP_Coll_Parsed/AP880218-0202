Deputy Chancellor Alois Mock head of the 
party that backed Kurt Waldheim for the presidency stuck by him 
Thursday but the party itself did not make a statement of support 
after a leadership caucus 
Mock also is foreign minister of the coalition government in 
which his conservative Peoples Party is the junior partner of 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzys Socialists 
Vranitzky has indicated Waldheim should resign because of 
questions about his conduct as a German army lieutenant in the 
Balkans during World War II Other political leaders ranging from 
Socialist to conservative have also suggested Waldheim step down 
Opinion polls this week have shown declining support for the 
president who on Monday rejected demands that he resign because of 
the report a governmentappointed commission of historians prpared 
on his war service 
It said he was in close proximity to Nazi atrocities knew 
of them and did nothing to stop them The historians said they 
found no proof that Waldheim committed war crimes but they left 
the question of guilt open 
Waldheim now 69 has consistently denied wrongdoing since 
allegations about his war service first appeared in March 1986 
during the presidential campaign 
The government named the international panel of historians at 
Waldheims request in September after the United States put the 
former UN secretarygeneral on a watch list of undesirable 
aliens that barred him from the country 
After the party leadership caucus Thursday Mock said Waldheims 
decision to stay in office should be respected by all democrats 
A source who attended the meeting said privately that prominent 
conservatives other than Mock believe Waldheim must go A statement 
issued after the meeting did not explicitly declare Peoples Party 
support for Waldheim indicating disagreement among its leaders 
Economics Minister Robert Graf a conservative who has indicated 
Waldheim should resign said he did not attend the party meeting 
Asked how Austrias political crisis should be solved he told The 
Associated Press The decision lies with the president 
Mock would not tell reporters whether Waldheim was criticized in 
the meeting He urged political parties to quit discussing the 
matter contending that more talk would endanger trust in 
political institutions 
He accused the state radiotelevision monopoly ORF of 
brainwashing of the public against Waldheim 
The reporting of ORF is scandalous onesided and 
unobjective he said Mock would not cite cases but said in 
response to questions There is a whole list of things where 
brainwashing of the public has been going on for weeks 
Thaddeus Podgorski head of the network issued a statement 
saying the reporting conformed with regulations governing 
broadcasting 
Johannes Kunz who is in charge of information at ORF issued a 
statement later saying The ORF correspondents were expressly 
ordered to include in their reports especially reactions positive 
for the president It does not lie within the responsibility of ORF 
that foreign reactions were overwhelmingly negative 
The government rejected a call by Israelis parliament for 
Waldheim to be forced from office and tried for war crimes The 
Foreign Ministry expressed Austrias indignation over the 
resolution passed unanimously by the Knesset on Tuesday 
Vranitzky said in rejecting the resolution that wholesale 
judgments and accusations of that kind would not serve anyone
