A businessman who wants to build a gambling 
casino in an abandoned shipyard says the project would spur 
economic recovery in this Rust Belt city but opponents warn of the 
specter of organized crime 
I thought they were nuts I said What A casino Mayor 
Alex Olejko said of the lessthanscenic site which is downstream 
from a wastewater treatment plant and large piles of iron ore 
pellets straddling the mouth of the Black River in this steelmaking 
city 
Even so Alan Spitzer who with his family runs 25 auto 
dealerships in Ohio and Florida envisions a 1000room hotel that 
would create 5000 jobs for Lorain which is in a county that state 
figures show has lost about 7000 jobs since 1979 
He says a yearround resort could draw tourists and 
conventioneers to Lorain about 30 miles west of Cleveland and 
visitors could go to nearby amusement parks major league sporting 
events and cultural events 
We think the industrial backdrop actually enhances and adds 
some ambiance said Spitzer who last month disclosed plans for 
the 300 million vacation resort 
Casino gambling is not legal in Ohio and Spitzer has enlisted 
the help of state Rep Joseph Koziura a Lorain Democrat to 
sponsor legislation that would allow casino gambling in the city of 
72000 residents for a fiveyear trial period if voters approved 
From the highrise hotel on the drawing boards visitors would 
have a backdoor view of downtown peppered with vacant storefronts 
or a large steel plant downstream 
There are few places in the country that have so many 
entertainment options in such a short distance and so accessible 
Spitzer said 
The only forms of gambling permitted in Ohio are charity bingo 
horse racing and the staterun lottery Casino gambling is legal in 
the United States only in Nevada and Atlantic City NJ 
William R Eadington a professor of economics at the University 
of NevadaReno who studies casino gambling regulations said he 
doesnt view the grimy Lorain site as a problem 
Eadington a consultant for the project said the location of a 
casino is not that crucial because resorts tend to be 
selfcontained and visitors have little reason to leave 
Reaction to the proposal has been mixed Local officials quickly 
embraced the project while others including some ministers 
promptly condemned it Others said theyd reserve judgment until 
the Legislature acts 
I really dont think the steelworkers will even think about 
this until it gets off the ground We dont believe in talk Talk 
is cheap said Al Pena president of United Steelworkers Local 
1104 which has 2700 members working at the USX Corp plant in 
Lorain 
In an editorial The Cleveland Plain Dealer suggested 
developers might not be able to prevent organized crime from 
getting a foothold in the resort or service industries despite 
tight controls in the legislation 
For their part Ohioans have had their fill of corruption on 
the part of public officials and agencies of lax enforcement of 
state regulations of conflicts of interest and payoffs Why now 
should voters invite more of the same the editorial said
