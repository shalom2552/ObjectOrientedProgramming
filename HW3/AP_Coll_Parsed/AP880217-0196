The Oregon Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that 
a motorist arrested on a drunken driving charge must be given a 
chance to call a lawyer before deciding whether to take a breath 
test 
An arrested driver has a right under the Oregon Constitution to 
a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice before deciding 
whether to submit to a breath test the court said in a unanimous 
decision 
The court noting that evidence of bloodalcohol content 
dissipates with time said police arent required to wait for a 
long period of time before administering the test 
But the opinion didnt hand down any ironclad rules on what 
will amount to a reasonable time to allow motorists to contact 
attorneys 
A footnote to the opinion said however A period of 15 
minutes after the request to take the test has been made will 
doubtless suffice in most cases 
The decision was the Supreme Courts third in seven years on the 
issue of whether suspected drunken drivers have a right to legal 
advice before making a decision on a breath test 
Refusing to take a breath test carries an automatic 120day 
drivers license suspension under state law 
In 1980 the Supreme Court said in a 43 ruling that arrested 
drivers were entitled to consult atorneys before deciding on breath 
tests 
A divided court in 1981 overruled that decision saying denial 
of access to legal counsel didnt require supression of breath test 
evidence 
The court Wednesday overturned that decision basing its ruling 
on a provision in the state constitution giving anyone accused of a 
crime a right to obtain legal counsel 
The evanescent nature of the evidence the police seek from 
breath tests may justify substantially limiting the time in which 
the person may exercise his or her right but it does not 
justify doing away with it the court said in an opinion by 
Justice Michael Gillette 
As a result defendant Ronald Spencers breath test findings 
cant be used as evidence against him Spencer was arrested by a 
Lane County sheriffs deputy on May 4 1985 and taken to the 
county jail His request to consult a lawyer before deciding on a 
breath test was refused 
His case was returned to the district court for trial
