Nora Astorga Nicaraguas ambassador 
to the United Nations was buried Monday with the honors of a 
national heroine and a martyr of the leftist Sandinista revolution 
Mrs Astorga who died of cancer Sunday at age 39 gained fame 
during the revolution by luring a general into her bedroom where 
he was killed by rebels 
She gained more publicity in 1984 when the Reagan 
administration rejected her as ambassador to the United States 
In a eulogy at the the Government House Hall of Heroes and 
Martyrs where the body lay in state Monday President Daniel 
Ortega said 
We have to accept her death filling the void she left with 
her example At the time she fought victory and triumph were only 
hopes but she was there watching as he companions were killed our 
wounded but she always went ahead in combat 
That was her conduct always committed to the cause of the 
poor and the workers and the freedom of Nicaragua She was 
outstanding as an examplary militant on the political front among 
the masses and the Sandinista womens organizations and in action 
as a commando 
Ortega recalled the commando action of 1978 at the height 
of the Sandinista revolution when she lured Gen Reynaldo Perez 
Vega deputy chief of the National Guard into her bedroom and 
rebels cut his throat 
Mrs Astorga who was married twice and had four children later 
explained the original plan was to kidnap Perez Vega and release 
him in exchange for 59 Sandinista prisoners She said the rebels 
tried to subdue him but Perez Vega resisted and they had to kill 
him 
Ortega said Monday That was Nora always firm always 
advancing always assuming the post the revolution assigned her 
during the times of struggle against the Somoza dictatorship and 
afterwards when it triumphed 
She was buried at the General Cemetery in Managuas old quarter 
Mrs Astorga was a lawyer and a member of the Sandinista 
assembly a consultative body 
Ortega appointed her ambassador to the United Nations in 
February 1986 
The Sandinistas ousted President Anastasio Somoza whose family 
had ruled for 42 years in July 1979
