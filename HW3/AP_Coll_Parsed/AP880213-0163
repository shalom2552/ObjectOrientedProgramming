Pat Robertson predicted a strong finish 
as his New Hampshire campaign entered its final weekend while a 
television interview aired in which he said Libyan leader Moammar 
Gadhafi should have been captured or killed 
Robertson in a wideranging interview with David Frost said he 
would not have hesitated to kill Gadhafi that repeated acts of 
adultery would disqualify a potential president and that 
homosexuals should receive no special legal protection 
Meanwhile in an interview with The Associated Press the former 
television evangelist said a strong showing in Tuesdays primary 
will boost his Republican presidential campaign as he heads toward 
friendly territory in the South 
Robertson said Gadhafi whose adopted infant daughter was killed 
during an attack on his headquarters by US Navy jets in 1986 
should have been taken out of the picture completely 
My sentiment was that we should have taken him prisoner gone 
after him somehow taken his power base away from him whatever 
that took Robertson said I wouldnt have hesitated to kill 
him Hes a madman and he was a terrorist 
Regarding adultery he said How could we be secure if we 
thought that the president of the United States was bedding down 
with a girlfriend of a Mafia boss as John Kennedy did or Gary 
Hart who knows who his girlfriends would normally be 
In todays world I think repeated dalliances and lies to 
cover them up I think are a disqualification for a presidential 
candidate Robertson said 
Robertson said homosexuals should be treated like other 
citizens but I cannot see that we would write this sexual 
practice into our law and give it a protected status 
Robertson who finished second in the Iowa caucuses trailing 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole but ahead of Vice President George 
Bush told the AP he expects to finish no lower than third in New 
Hampshire 
Whether I come in third second or first I will be 
beautifully positioned to go out of here into the South 
Robertson said I have a very strong organization in the South 
My polling shows that 38 percent of the New Hampshire 
Republican and independent voters are still undecided with only a 
few days left to go he said 
He said the secondplace finish in Iowa has helped his fund 
raising but he would not reveal how much money has come in 
He said former Secretary of State Alexander Haigs withdrawal 
from the GOP race Friday and his endorsement of Dole is not going 
to make a great deal of difference in the outcome in New Hampshire 
Im going to pick up some of the Haig support and some may go 
to Bob Dole but I dont think theres going to be much of a ripple 
for any of us he said
