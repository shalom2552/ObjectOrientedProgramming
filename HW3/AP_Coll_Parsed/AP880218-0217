A baby born with most of his brain 
missing and kept on lifesupport systems to preserve his organs for 
transplant was pronounced brain dead Thursday and a search was 
under way for compatible organ recipients 
The 7pound child known as Baby Boy John remained on 
lifesupport systems at Loma Linda University Medical Center on 
Thursday afternoon officials said The infant suffered from 
anencephaly which kills most babies within days 
Four babies whose blood type matched that of Baby John were 
known to need livers and they were being evaluated for transplant 
said Dr Joyce Peabody Loma Linda chief of neonatology 
No other cases in which anencephalics have been kept on 
lifesupport for organ transplant have been announced in the United 
States although Dr Leonard Bailey chief of Loma Lindas heart 
transplant program last year suggested there have been such 
infants 
Baby John was born Tuesday at Martin Luther Hospital Medical 
Center in Anaheim and transferred to Loma Linda where Bailey has 
pioneered infant heart transplants 
By 9 oclock last evening our clinical criteria for brain 
death were met Ms Peabody said She added that a neurologist 
unconnected with Loma Linda confirmed the brain death Thursday 
The organs of anencephalic babies can be transplanted only if 
organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infants on 
lifesupport Baby Johns parents who asked not to be identified 
had wanted other babies to receive his organs 
Loma Linda maintained the infant on lifesupport under 
guidelines developed last year after a woman pregnant with an 
anencephalic child waged a nationwide campaign to find a hospital 
that would consent to keep the baby on lifesupport until the 
organs could be donated However the baby was stillborn 
Loma Linda guidelines call for doctors to use machines to keep 
the organs of anencephalic infants functioning for up to seven 
days then disconnect lifesupport and let the baby die if brain 
death hasnt occurred 
The procedure was denounced by the National Right to Life 
Committee which accused Loma Linda of going beyond prevailing 
medical ethics 
It is an outrage to see how Loma Linda has bulldozed ahead in 
anencephalic experiments said Brian Johnston the groups 
Western director He called for a halt to further use of organs 
from anencephalics 
We are confronted with the very real possibility that body 
parts will be taken from live children he said 
One of the hospitals 13 heart transplant patients under age 4 
received the heart of an anencephalic baby earlier this year but 
the donor child was in Canada 
Bailey set off a medical controversy in 1984 when he 
transplanted the heart of a baboon into an infant known as Baby 
Fae She died 20 days later
