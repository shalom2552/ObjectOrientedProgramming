A baby born with most of his brain 
missing was on lifesupport systems Wednesday to preserve his 
organs for transplant a hospital official said It was the first 
such case announced in the United States 
The baby whose name was withheld to protect the parents 
privacy was born Tuesday at Martin Luther Hospital Medical Center 
in Anaheim and transferred to Loma Linda University Medical Center 
said Loma Linda spokeswoman Anita Rockwell 
At Loma Linda the baby was put on lifesupport equipment 
The infant appears comfortable and is showing signs of 
brainstem death Ms Rockwell said 
The baby suffers from anencephaly in which most of the brain is 
missing Such children almost always die within days Their organs 
can be transplanted only if organ damage is prevented by 
maintaining the infants on lifesupport 
Loma Linda is maintaining the infant under medical guidelines 
developed last year after a woman pregnant with an anencephalic 
baby waged a nationwide campaign to find a hospital that would 
consent to keep her child on lifesupport until the organs could be 
donated However the child was stillborn 
The guidelines call for doctors to use machines to keep the 
babys organs functioning properly for up to seven days Ms 
Rockewell said 
If doctrs declare the infant braindead within seven days he 
will be listed on national organ donor registries If the baby 
isnt brain dead after seven days lifesupport systems will be 
removed and the baby allowed to die 
We dont want to prolong the agony of the parents We feel 
there needs to be a limit set as to how long well continue this 
Ms Rockwell 
No cases of anencephalics being maintained on lifesupport have 
been announced in the United States although Dr Leonard Bailey 
chief of Loma Lindas heart transplant program hinted last 
November there have been such infants 
One of the hospitals 13 heart transplant patients under age 4 
received the heart of an anencephalic baby but the donor child was 
in Canada 
Bailey triggered an international medical controversy in 1984 
when he transplanted the heart of a baboon into an infant known as 
Baby Fae She died 20 days later
