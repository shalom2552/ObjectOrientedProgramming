The head of the US delegation to a 
review of the Helsinki accords accused Moscow and its allies Friday 
of hampering progress on a final document by stalling on human 
rights issues 
What we see now is that things are beginning either to level 
off or in some cases to go backward Warren Zimmermann said at 
the third followup Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe 
Textual obligations are festooned with loopholes that deprive 
them of all force Zimmermann told a plenary meeting referring 
to Soviet bloc draft proposals For example freedom of religion 
must be consistent with public safety order health and morals 
Other freedoms are limited by national legislation 
Zimmermann told a news conference that in the three weeks since 
the meeting resumed after a Christmas break he noticed a very 
serious effort by the East bloc to put off an agreement 
I hope its tactical and I hope that it will change he said 
Delegates from 35 countries including the United States Canada 
and all European nations except Albania have been meeting in Vienna 
since November 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 Helsinki 
accords on military security economic cooperation and humanitarian 
issues 
Zimmermann rejected Soviet bloc assertions that the West is 
stressing humanitarian concerns at the expense of European 
disarmament issues 
Were not holding any element here hostage to any other 
element Zimmermann said 
He also said the obstructionist approach of Soviet bloc 
governments at the conference has been accompanied by 
disquieting signs of failure of those same governments to 
observe Helsinki commitments at home 
Zimmermann noted that a Soviet promise to release all 
religious prisoners in an amnesty last November was not kept 
and the elimination of psychiatric abuse is still awaited despite 
promises made as recently as yesterday 
He said he noticed similar human rights abuses in other bloc 
countries including Romania and Czechoslovakia 
The concluding date of the conference has been postponed twice 
Before Christmas diplomats set the deadline for Easter but some 
Western dilopmats now say summer would be more realistic 
The accords or the 1975 Helsinki Final Act include commitments 
to honor human rights individual freedoms travel and other 
exchanges among nations The 35 signatory nations promised to honor 
the covenants provisions but the accords have no enforcement 
mechanism
