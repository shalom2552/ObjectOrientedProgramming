Hundreds of students rallied in the rain 
outside a University of Massachusetts building to support its 
occupation by black students protesting campus racism 
Many of the estimated 200 students held lighted candles and sang 
during the rally Monday night outside the New Africa House 
officials said 
Earlier in the evening the dozens of students occupying the 
building evacuated it after a telephoned bomb threat said 
protester spokesman Dwayne Warren They returned about 10 minutes 
later when campus police found no bomb Warren said 
The students said they planned to present a revised list of 
demands to Chancellor Joseph Duffey this afternoon but refused to 
provide details 
Classes scheduled for New Africa House today were to be held in 
other buildings because the university does not plan to evict the 
students and because several faculty members refused to teach there 
during the protest said university spokesman James Langley 
We see this as a shortterm temporary thing We dont want to 
escalate tensions Langley said adding that officials hoped a 
resolution to the dispute could be reached following the meeting 
between Duffey and the students 
The occupiers began getting support from white students Monday 
as students began trickling back to campus after a long holiday 
weekend Several returning students said they had left before the 
building was taken over Friday and had been unaware of the protest 
Between 50 and 200 students remained in the building through the 
weekend said Roscoe Robinson 24 of Boston a spokesman for the 
protesters 
The number fluctuates as people come and go but at least 60 
have remained in the building at all times Robinson said 
When asked how protesters were spending their time he 
responded Were studying Were students 
Weve set aside the third floor of the building as a study 
hall and some of the graduate students with us who are teaching 
assistants are working with students Robinson said 
The students had been scheduled to meet Monday with Duffey but 
the session was canceled because he left campus to visit an ill 
brother 
After becoming aware of the illness the protesters sent Duffey 
a sympathy card signed by more than 200 students Duffey responded 
by sending them a fruit basket and a card reading I send 
affection and respect 
The takeover was sparked by the alleged beating last weekend of 
two black students by six whites following a dormitory party 
A group of graduate students Monday were organizing an effort to 
have white students and faculty wear black armbands in support of 
the protest 
Its a symbolic gesture but the racism on campus has gone on 
for too long and is far too prevelant said graduate student 
Frank Tripoli Its time to begin putting an end to it 
Among the initial demands presented to university officials last 
week was that five white students allegedly involved in the weekend 
beating be suspended 
Robinson refused to discuss specifics of the revised demands 
until Duffey had a chance to review them Robinson said the thrust 
of the demands remained unchanged but that the students had 
revised the wording to make them more acceptable to administrators 
About 9 percent of the 25000 students at Massachusetts largest 
public university are minorities There are 641 blacks enrolled and 
about 500 are undergraduates Langley said Total undergraduate 
enrollment is about 19000 students
