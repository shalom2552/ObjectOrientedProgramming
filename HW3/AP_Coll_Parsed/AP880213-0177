Swaggart thanked President Daniel Ortega for letting him take his 
religious crusade to thousands of Nicaraguan enthusiasts in 
Managuas Plaza of the Revolution 
We have not come to involve ourselves in the politics of the 
nation but to exhalt Jesus Christ he declared Friday night in 
an apparent reference to the 6yearold civil war between the 
leftist Sandinista government and USsupported Contra rebels

plaza since the Sandinistas came to power in July 1979 and 
Swaggart thanked Ortega for the facilities lent by his 
government 
Swaggart also brought power generators to prevent his service 
from being uninterrupted by Managuas frequent blackouts 
Government officials have blamed the countrys energy shortage on 
the rebels sabotage of power installations 
Swaggart who preached in English and was translated into 
Spanish sang his first song in Spanish 
The staterun radio station La Primerissima cautioned listeners 
that Swaggart generally assists the foreign policy of the United 
States administration but did not specify how 
Government radio television and newspapers had advertised 
Swaggarts arrival as did the opposition paper La Prensa 
In a letter published by La Prensa a Roman Catholic reader 
complained of the advertisement on Sandinista television which 
has been denied to Catholic bishops especially his eminence 
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo 
Obando y Bravo the archishop of Managua has been a frequent 
critic of the government The country is predominantly Roman 
Catholic
