A victorious George Bush flushed with a 
New Hampshire primary win vowed Tuesday night to rise again 
when the presidential campaign moves South 
Frequently interrupted by chants of We want George and 
Were Number One Bush spoke of polls that had him slightly 
behind Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole in the Republican 
presidential race 
Tonight I feel I have a lot in common with Mark Twain he 
said Reports of my death were greatly exaggerated 
With 94 percent of the precincts reporting Bush had 38 percent 
to 29 percent for Dole Others trailed far behind 
And now Im going home to change the laundry and on to the 
South where were going to rise again Bush told cheering 
supporters 
Bush thanked the voters of New Hampshire and in a personal note 
said Ill never forget you 
You havent chosen a man he said his wife Barbara by his 
side Youve chosen a course to expand our prosperity to see 
that it touches every hamlet every home Youve chosen to back 
a strong America an America strong enough to bring peace to the 
entire world 
Bush planned to spend Wednesday in Washington and then campaign 
on Thursday in Missouri and Texas two Super Tuesday states 
Once the commanding frontrunner in polls in the first primary 
state Bush saw himself fall into a virtual deadheat with Dole 
after Doles victory in the Feb 8 Iowa caucuses Beaten 21 by 
Dole in Iowa Bush also trailed former television evangelist Pat 
Robertson in the caucuses 
The postIowa Bush sought more contact with voters making 
improptu stops at shopping malls sitting at the wheel of a big 
truck and a forklift and declaring that he had strong feelings 
even if he doesnt always show them 
Bushs national campaign manager Lee Atwater said the New 
Hampshire win would wipe out the Iowa loss 
New Hampshire is the big enchilada in American politics 
Atwater said He attributed Bushs win to the vice president 
talking about issues while Dole was talking about all this 
momentum jazz 
As he prepared to retire for the night Bush told supporters 
I leave you with four little words that will be on my mind when I 
take the oath 11 months from now Thank you New Hampshire
