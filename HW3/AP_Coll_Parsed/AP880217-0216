The House voted Wednesday to allow medical 
malpractice lawsuits against the federal government on behalf of 
activeduty military personnel who suffer injury or death because 
of negligent care at military hospitals 
The Reagan administration opposes the bill sponsored by Rep 
Barney Frank DMass on the ground that it would restrict a 
longstanding Supreme Court doctrine that the government is not 
liable for servicerelated injuries to members of the armed forces 
The House approved the bill on a 31261 roll call after voice 
votes approving a 300000 ceiling on the governments liability 
and rejecting a proposal to make the bills provisions retroactive 
to Jan 1 1986 The bill now goes to the Senate 
A virtually identical bill passed the House by a 31790 vote in 
1985 but the Senate never acted on it 
The Housepassed bill Wednesday would cover permanent military 
hospitals but would exclude treatment at field hospitals or 
hospital ships and claims stemming from combat activities or 
foreign jurisdictions 
The measure also would prohibit claims for mental or emotional 
disabilities unless they resulted from a physical injury 
Frank is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on 
administrative law and governmental relations which had heard 
numerous witnesses testify about medical malpractice involving 
activeduty military personnel at military hospitals 
Activeduty servicemen represent about onethird of those 
treated at military hospitals and are the only patients who cannot 
sue for medical malpractice 
The federal government generally is immune from being sued 
unless it gives its consent Under a 1946 federal law however the 
government can be sued for acts of negligence by its employees 
while on official duty but the same law protects the government 
from legal claims stemming from wartime military combat operations 
The Supreme Court ruled in 1950 that the law bars activeduty 
military personnel from suing the federal government for damages 
arising from government action or inaction in other situations 
This ruling does not prohibit military dependents or retirees from 
suing the government for medical malpractice
