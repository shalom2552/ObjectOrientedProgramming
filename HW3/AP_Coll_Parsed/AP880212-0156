Four months after the stock market collapse the 
government on Friday reported a lower trade deficit rising prices 
and mounting piles of unsold goods baffling the markets over 
whether to expect inflation or recession 
The confusion was first reflected in the inflationsensitive 
bond market where prices first soared and then sank in a half hour 
of wild gyrations Stocks and the dollar rose 
Interest rates finished the day higher in a setback for 
individual and corporate borrowers that some economists believe 
could tip the precariously balanced economy into recession 
The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit 
shrank to 122 billion in December the lowest figure since 
January 1987 even though the gap for all of 1987 totaled a record 
1712 billion 
Exporting manufacturers are continuing to do a booming business 
but demand for imports remains healthy as well the trade report 
showed 
The impression of a strong potentially inflationary economy was 
heightened by the Labor Departments report that wholesale prices 
rose 04 percent in January 
The yield on the Treasurys benchmark 30year bond an 
indicator for interest rates throughout the economy rose to 844 
percent from 835 percent late Thursday as the bonds price sagged 
Wall Street took the reports more favorably than the bond market 
as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2172 points to 
198326 one hour before the close of New York Stock Exchange 
trading 
The dollar strengthened about 12 percent percent against key 
currencies rising to about 131 Japanese yen and 171 West German 
marks 
Contrasting with the signs of economic strength was one sign of 
weakness The Commerce Department said business inventories shot up 
08 percent in December the third consecutive large monthly 
advance 
The reports suggested that since the Oct 19 stock plunge the 
economy remains balanced on the knife edge between inflation 
brought on by the improvement in trade and recession brought on 
by tight credit and sluggish consumer spending 
Fridays jump in interest rates was interpreted by some 
economists as evidence that investors are confident about economic 
growth and concerned about the risks of inflation 
In addition to the reports on trade and wholesale prices the 
economy showed sparks of life in Thursdays report that retail 
sales rose 05 percent in January 
We believe that there is enough strength in the manufcturing 
sector to prevent a recession And if we get any strength in the 
consumer side thats just gravy said Douglas Schindewolf 
associate economist for Smith Barney Harris Upham amp Co 
But other economists said the economy shows fundamental signs of 
weakness such as the report that inventories of unsold goods are 
piling up on shelves 
Investors are not especially worried about a resurgence of 
inflation argued Robert Brusca chief fixedincome economist for 
Nikko Securities Co International Inc 
Disagreeing with the prevailing interpretation Brusca argued 
that investors sold bonds Friday because they had been expecting a 
cut in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve and didnt get it 
Brusca said the Federal Reserve made a mistake by not cutting 
the discount rate which would have made life easier for borrowers 
and resuscitated an ailing economy 
When the patient has been pulled out of a pool thats a good 
time to administer artificial resuscitation rather than wait till 
he stops breathing Brusca said 
The increase in producer prices reported Friday was not large 
and followed three months of decline Brusca said arguing against 
the likelihood of zooming inflation 
Im concerned about what the Fed has done here I dont think 
its good Brusca said 
Merrill Lynch amp Co economists believe Fridays reports confirm 
their view that the economy will continue to slog forward through 
1988 and that a recession is not likely until 1989 said senior 
economist Bruce Steinberg 
Steinberg said he does not believe a discount rate cut is either 
imminent or needed
