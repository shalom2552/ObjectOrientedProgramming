Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis is 
emerging as the early oddson favorite to win the Democratic 
partys presidential nomination among union political activists 
gathered here for the AFLCIOs annual winter meeting 
But unlike 1984 and 1968 the last presidential elections when 
labor united early behind a single candidate Walter Mondale and 
Hubert Humprey respectively there is no sense of urgency among 
their leaders to attempt playing the role of kingmaker this year 
Most of our folks are waiting to find out who the winner is 
and then jump on board said Sam Dawson political director for 
the 494000member United Steelworkers Union The AFLCIOs 
36member policymaking executive council is all over the lot and 
within every union the rankandfile is all over the lot 
Only if Dukakis had won the Iowa primary where he had the 
unqualified support of unionized public employees could the 
AFLCIO have made an endorsement before the Democratic National 
Convention next July in Atlanta according to Dawson and several 
other union activists here 
Dukakis thirdplace finish in Iowa behind Rep Richard Gephardt 
of Missouri and Sen Paul Simon of Illinois makes it all but 
impossible for labor leaders to tell individual union members now 
to disregard their advice through 1987 and to get to Atlanta as a 
delegate any way they can and for whomever they please 
I had hoped we could make an endorsement after Iowa and 
Tuesdays primary election in New Hampshire but now it would 
take something cataclysmic for us to endorse said Rachelle 
Horowitz political director for the American Federation of 
Teachers 
However Ms Horowitz a Dukakis partisan and one of 42 
automatic labor delegates to the convention as members of the 
Democratic National Committee is shedding no tears over the lack 
of an early consensus 
If we learned anything from the Mondale period when we needed 
a winner after Reagans unionbusting its the danger of whipping 
ourselves into such a frenzy that we cant see when a winner is not 
there she said Up until and including election day I believed 
Fritz Mondale could win 
While preferring any of the six Democrats in the race over any 
Republican unions continue to hedge their bets dealing with 
contenders in both parties 
None of them has plucked my heart yet said William Wynn 
president of the 1 millionmember United Food and Commercial 
Workers Union the third largest in the AFLCIO behind the newly 
reunited Teamsters union at 16 million members and the American 
Federation of State County and Municipal Employees at 11 million 
A plurality of UFCW members appears to prefer Dukakis said 
Allen Zack a spokesman for the union But Jackson also 
demonstrated strong support among largely white members of his 
union in Iowa because of his appearance over the past two years on 
picket lines in strikes at meatpacking plants in the state Zack 
said 
AFSCME President Gerald McEntee while abiding by the letter of 
AFLCIO President Lane Kirklands guidelines saying union 
presidents should remain neutral until the federation itself makes 
an endorsement leaves little doubt that Dukakis is the preferred 
choice of his unions members 
In some states like New York were running a twocandidate 
strategy with Dukakis and Jesse Jackson McEntee said But the 
vast majority of our people are for Dukakis 
That sentiment while dominant is not universal among other 
leaders of the 91 unions belonging to AFLCIO 
The United Auto Workers is claiming the biggest role in Iowa by 
helping Gephardt win a plurality of votes there because of his 
advocacy of mandating tariffs on Japanese and Korean imports if 
they do not open their markets to more US goods 
UAW leaders however acknowledge they are not putting all of 
their eggs in Gephardts basket because he is pushing their version 
of restrictionist trade legislation 
Gephardt might crash and burn said Peter Laarman a UAW 
spokesman Were playing by the AFLCIO rules Our issue is trade 
and corporate accountability but we have quite a few people for 
example in Pennsylvania who are for Simon 
Simon also is the most popular Democratic candidate among 
steelworkers in Pennyslvania and Ohio the unions two biggest 
membership states according to Dawson But Dawson and other union 
activists also see Simon as an alsoran if he finishes behind 
Dukakis and Gephardt in Tuesdays New Hampshire primary 
Im running as a Simon delegate in New York if hes still 
alive after New Hampsire said Joyce Miller a vice president of 
the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and one of three 
women on the AFLCIO executive council 
Meanwhile nearly every union is treating black minister Jesse 
Jackson with deference this year in contrast to their view of him 
as a spoiler who hurt their endorsement of Mondale in 1984 
According to Ms Horowitz Jackson could easily win four states 
Louisiana Mississippi Alabama and Georgia in the Super 
Tuesday primary elections on March 8 
Gephardt Simon and Dukakis all have big support in the trade 
union movement she said Only Al Gore a Democratic senator 
from Tennessee is not slating our delegates
