Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt 
looking South after their onetwo finish in New Hampshires 
Democratic primary said today that campaign themes should not 
change with the region Paul Simon said he would withdraw from the 
race unless he wins one of two contests next week 
People in the South arent voting for a zip code Theyre 
voting for the president of the United States Dukakis the 
Massachusetts governor said on ABCs Good Morning America 
Gephardt appearing on the same program characterized his 
second place finish in New Hampshire as a victory The reason we 
won he said is because we got off the plane last week and 
began saying the same thing in New Hampshire that we said in Iowa 
Dukakis said the race still was wide open Gephardt said it 
had now come down to him and Dukakis 
Meanwhile Simon who came in third said I have to win 
either in South Dakota or Minnesota Otherwise Im going to have to 
withdraw 
Dukakis the threeterm governor of nextdoor Massachusetts won 
Tuesdays primary with a strong 17percentage point margin over the 
Missouri congressman He was leaving today for the next major 
battleground the South 
Even as he did however Dukakis acknowledged that his victory 
didnt decide the race but drew the battle lines more clearly I 
think its going to go all the way to the last primary he said 
Gephardt whose victory in Iowas caucuses eight days earlier 
was largely overshadowed by the brawl on the Republican side 
accomplished his chief aim finishing ahead of fellow Midwesterner 
Simon 
I love New Hampshire Gephardt said 
Its a result that we needed here Gephardt said It 
appears to be that weve got a DukakisGephardt race in the rest of 
the country but that could change 
Dukakis won 37 percent of the vote and said the victory gives 
him momentum heading into the delegaterich primaries on March 8 
when contests are set in every state of the South but one 
The Massachusetts governor won nearly as many votes as his next 
two closest challengers combined and he was leaving immediately 
for the next round of campaigning in Atlanta and Florida 
Last week in Iowa our message started to shine through and we 
won a bronze he said a reference to his thirdplace finish in 
that states caucuses Tonight here in New Hampshire our message 
came through loud and clear We went for the gold and we won it 
Gephardt had 20 percent and Simon the Illinois senator had 17 
percent 
Jesse Jacksons 8 percent put him in fourth place ahead of 
Tennessean Albert Gore Jrs 7 percent Bruce Babbitt finished with 
just 5 percent and headed for Washington to meet with advisers and 
wrestle with the question of whether to withdraw 
Finishing last with 4 percent was Gary Hart the prohibitive 
frontrunner a year ago who saw his presidential hopes wrecked with 
embarrassing disclosures about his personal life 
When he reentered the race in midDecember Hart said let 
the people decide and in New Hampshire their decision wasnt the 
one he wanted He said it would take 30 to 60 days to determine 
if I can put together a viable candidacy and suggested he may 
scale back the scope of his effort 
Its a disappointing showing but were not discouraged Hart 
said 
Gephardt was leaving New Hampshire before dawn for stops in 
South Dakota and Wyoming both of which have contests in the next 
three weeks 
Gephardt was betting on gaining a boost in South Dakota and 
planned to be in that small state six out of the next seven days 
even though its primary next Tuesday is a beauty contest where 
voters express a preference but dont award nominating delegates 
He came into New Hampshire saddled with debt as was Simon Both 
face the prospect of a threeweek campaign where the costs of 
buying television airtime across the South are enormous and where 
they may be forced to select states to contest while bypassing 
others 
Were not badly in debt Gephardt said Were in good 
shape Money is coming in 
Gores fifthplace finish wasnt good enough to give him any 
boost going into the South as he had hoped Gore spent a lot of 
money in New Hampshire but not a lot of time and he departed the 
state for much of the final week while his competitors dominated 
the airwaves 
Simon was heading to Minnesota which like South Dakota has its 
contest next Tuesday and where he must do well to stay in the race 
Simon had predicted he would beat Gephardt and challenge Dukakis 
in New Hampshire but he insisted were moving on 
Jackson and Gore both of whom have an enormous stake in the 
Super Tuesday primaries across the South were campaigning there 
today Jackson was heading to Florida and Gore watched the returns 
from Texas 
All the candidates were converging on Texas where the first of 
a series of Southern debates is set for Thursday night in Dallas 
The Republicans debate there on Friday 
Although the first primary of the 1988 campaign was likely to 
winnow the field none of the losers displayed a willingness to 
leave the race right away The most likely candidate appeared to be 
Babbitt and Jackson said he talked with Babbitt about gaining an 
endorsement if the former Arizona governor quits the race 
No way Babbitt insisted when asked if he would withdraw 
But he said he planned meetings with supporters to ask Should I 
wage a guerrilla campaign or should I withdraw and do something 
else 
Although far more was at stake in New Hampshire 18 nominating 
delegates were awarded by the primary results Dukakis collected 9 
Gephardt 6 and Simon 3 
The rest got none
