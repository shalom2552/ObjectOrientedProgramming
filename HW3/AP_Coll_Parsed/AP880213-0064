Guerrillas attacked a white 
farmers house with rocket launchers and firearms early today then 
fled across the border into Zimbabwe the government said 
No one was injured in the predawn attack and damage to the 
farmhouse was minor said the regional army commander Gen George 
Meiring He said a limpet mine and antipersonnel mines were found 
in the area 
South African officials said the attackers had entered from 
Zimbabwe and sent a terse message to the government of the 
neighboring blackruled state 
The South African government urges the Zimbabwean government 
immediately to seek out the attackers and also wishes to state that 
it reserves the right to take whatever steps it deems necessary to 
prevent further incursions of this nature the message said 
In the past South African forces have staged raids into 
neighboring countries on suspected bases of the African National 
Congress black guerrilla movement 
Zimbabwe like several other countries bordering South Africa 
says it allows the ANC to operate politically but not militarily in 
its territory 
Over the past three years ANC guerrillas occasionally have 
placed land mines on the roads of whiteowned farms in South 
African border areas 
About 20 whites and blacks have been killed in the attacks 
which the ANC says are justified because most white farmers 
participate in an antiguerrilla civil defense network 
During the land mine campaign there have been few assaults on 
farmhouses 
The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to end 
whiteminority domination in South Africa 
South Africas 5 million whites control the government and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services under a 
legal and traditional system of racial segregation called 
apartheid The countrys 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs 
In a separate incident police said two black municipal 
policemen were shot and seriously wounded Friday night by unknown 
assailants in Soweto Johannesburgs main black township 
Black officers have been frequent targets of ANC guerrillas and 
antiapartheid militants who consider them government collaborators
