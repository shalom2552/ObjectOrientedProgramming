Flooding on major French waterways has paralyzed 
river traffic inundated some homes and submerged the Seine River 
expressway 
About 800 barges on the Seine Marne Yonne and Sambre rivers 
were unablie to operate in the biggest crisis since 1982 the 
Boatmens Union said today 
The state Bridges and Roads department last week prohibited 
barge traffic on the Seine where the high water level made it 
impossible for many barges to pass under the bridges of Paris 
The water level swelled by unusually high rainfall has been 
rising for the past two weeks washing out the expressway that runs 
along the Seine in central Paris 
The River Brigade said the Seine water level Monday morning had 
exceeded 165 feet An alert is given when the water level hits 
five meters or 164 feet the level reached in 1982 
Water was rising above the haunches of the zouave the statue of 
an infantryman in oriental dress at the foot of the Alma Bridge 
near the Eiffel Tower 
In 1910 the Seine lapped at the zouaves chin in the worst 
flooding this century 
About 100 homes were flooded in VilleneuveSaint George in the 
Val de Marne region east of Paris and eight villages were 
inundated in the Essonne region authorities said 
Small boats have been relaying bread and mail to flooded 
communities 
The Boatmens Union said the loss to bargeowners who transport 
things like sand coal and even cars would be important but 
could not estimate a figure
