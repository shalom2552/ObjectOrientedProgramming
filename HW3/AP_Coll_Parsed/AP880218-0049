An estimated 550 inmates used beds and other 
furniture to barricade themselves inside a dozen jail dormitories 
on Rikers Island early Thursday in an apparent protest over 
searches authorities said 
Early reports indicated that no hostages were taken and no 
injuries were reported said city correction department spokeswoman 
Ruby Ryles 
The inmates took over the dormitories at the Anna M Cross 
Center the citys maximumsecurity jail around midnight 
Wednesday Ms Ryles said The center houses mainly convicted 
felons awaiting transfers to state jails as well as some prisoners 
awaiting trial 
The inmates barricaded doors and entrances and exits so they 
are not allowing correction officers in she said 
Negotiators with the mutual assistance team a team of 
officers trained to handle disturbances of this sort made 
contact with the prisoners around 2 am and extra guards were 
deployed at the facility Ms Ryles said 
The security staff is apparently talking with the inmates in 
an attempt to resolve the disturbance peacefully she said 
They are also trying to determine what their complaints and their 
problems are 
Although it was not immediately known what sparked the uprising 
inmates had strongly protested searches conducted by guards 
Wednesday Ms Ryles said 
Inmates at the center which houses 2400 inmates in all are 
kept in dormitories large rooms filled with beds rather than 
cells she said A head count was conducted 
The citys prison system is currently at slightly more than 100 
percent of capacity with more than 15000 prisoners more than 
11000 at Rikers Ms Ryles said 
The inmates had been calling news organizations to say that they 
had taken over the entire facility Ms Ryles said but the claim 
was not true
