An unsually large Soviet pledge of 250000 
tons of grain to famineplagued Ethiopia has generated surprise 
among US officials but concern over who will pay for delivery 
The US Agency for International Development has officially 
welcomed the Soviet commitment pointing out that it has encouraged 
all potential donors to make a contribution to easing Ethiopias 
plight 
As one of the worlds largest grain importers it is somewhat 
unusual for Moscow to play the role of food donor But Ethiopia is 
a close Kremlin ally and has benefited for years from Western food 
conributions 
According to Agriculture Department figures the Soviet Union is 
expected to purchase about 32 million tons of grain during the year 
ending next June 30 But Soviet grain harvests have been 
comparatively good during 198687 surpassing 200 million tons in 
consecutive years for the first time 
The Soviet pledge was made three weeks ago generating surprise 
here because the largest previous donation by Moscow to Ethiopia 
was 10000 metric tons of rice during the 198485 famine 
The latest food shortage is primarily the result of a severe 
drought last summer 
The 250000ton pledge exceeds the US commitment by about 
3000 tons An AID statement said the combined contribution of 
Western nations exceeds half a million tons 
The major unanswered question US officials are asking is who 
will pick up the cost of distributing the Soviet deliveries 
AID said it would have no objection if private voluntary 
organizations working in Ethiopia help in distribution of the 
Soviet grains but no request has been made thus far 
We naturally assume that the Soviets will fund the cost of 
distribution as AID has done for food provided by the US 
government the agency said estimating at 25 million the cost 
of delivering the Soviet shipments 
A US official said that the Soviets have provided transport 
aircraft to Ethiopia for food distribution in the past as well as 
trucks and Soviet drivers
