To make government more accountable top party 
officials should be elected by all Communist Party members more 
than one candidate should run and the balloting should be secret a 
Pravda article proposed 
Activists in the Ukraine made the suggestions which appeared in 
a frontpage article in Sundays editions of the partys main 
newspaper indicating the Communist leadership is seriously 
considering them 
The article said the issues will be formally taken up at the 
19th AllUnion Party Conference a rare gathering of the nations 
Communists to be held June 28 in Moscow Mikhail S Gorbachev has 
raised the same issues the article suggested and has said electoral 
reform will be a key topic at the conference 
At a plenary meeting of the partys Central Committee in January 
1986 the Soviet leader brought up the idea of secret ballots and 
discussed the possibility of giving party members a choice in 
voting for top party officials 
Gorbachev also criticized the current system for allowing 
bureaucrats to remain in party posts for life regardless of their 
productivity and discussed broadening the nomination procedure 
for government elections 
Some of the suggestions have been adopted experimentally 
In what the government called democratization 
multiplecandidate elections for local party posts were held in 
several areas in June All of the candidates had to be approved by 
the Communist Party the only party permitted to field candidates 
In the June experiments party members in one of every 25 voting 
districts chose among more than one candidate for local governing 
councils Runoff elections had to be held in 59 of the Soviet 
Unions 52000 districts 
Whether the experiment will be expanded is not clear but the 
continued media attention indicates the idea is still very much 
alive The party conference in June could set the stage for making 
the system permanent and nationwide 
Gorbachev has also brought a little democracy to the working 
place In June the Soviet parliament or Supreme Soviet approved 
competitive elections for managers of state enterprises The idea 
is to make them more accountable 
In its report Sunday on a meeting of Kiev University Communists 
Pravda said there would be a diversity of views if more than one 
candidate were to run for party first secretary 
What will remain is a struggle of opinions a debate a search 
for alternatives variations and a choice of the best among them 
Pravda said 
Currently only top party bodies elect the first secretary and 
any debate about whom to choose is held behind closed doors The 
first secretary is the top party official The post exists at the 
city regional and republic level 
Pravda also suggested that all Communists take part in the 
voting not just members of party committees and that the 
balloting be conducted secretly 
These electoral changes the newspaper said would help make top 
party officials more accountable to the people and eliminate the 
cult of personality that surrounds them 
Another Soviet newspaper Socialisticheskaya Industriya on 
Sunday carried suggestions that the terms of party officials and 
their ages be restricted 
When this or that person has been sitting in his ruling chair 
for dozens of years then no experience he has garnered can 
compensate willynilly for a dulling of the feeling of newness a 
fear of the risk of going forward the newspaper said
