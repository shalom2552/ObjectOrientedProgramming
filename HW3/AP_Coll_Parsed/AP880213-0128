The president of Italy on Saturday rejected the 
resignation of Giovanni Goria and told him to stay on as premier to 
get the countrys 1988 budget approved 
President Francesco Cossiga summoned the Christian Democrat 
politician to the presidential palace to inform him of his decision 
A statement from the presidential palace said Goria was asked to 
return because his presence was an absolute necessity to pass the 
national budget The deadline for parliamentary approval of the 
budget is April 30 
Goria said in a statement that he accepted the decision because 
he understood the difficulties of the moment and the call to a 
sense of responsibility that everyone of us must have 
Gorias resignation Wednesday marked the second time he had done 
so since November When he resigned last week he cited factional 
fighting within his own Christian Democrat party and accused party 
dissidents of demonstrating a lack of responsibility 
He met later Saturday night with Senate President Giovanni 
Spadolini and Nilde Iotti the Communist speaker of the Chamber of 
Deputies to tell them Cossigas decision 
Just before he met Iotti one Italian jounalist told him 
Welcome back Goria quipped Never left 
Cossigas other options included appointing a new 
premierdesignate to try to form a new coalition government or 
dissolving Parliament and calling early general elections 
Goria at 44 is Italys youngest ever premier He resigned 
after a series of defeats on secret votes on the budget convinced 
him he could no longer govern At the time Cossiga asked him to 
remain in a caretaker capacity until the decision on a new 
government could be made 
While Cossigas decision at least temporarily resurrects Italys 
47th postwar government it does not resolve the problems within 
the governing coalition that led to the collapse 
Even before the decision was announced Gorias reappointment 
for the approval of the budget had emerged as the principal 
shortterm solution 
This would allow us to move on to the next phase in a less 
convulsive way said Arnaldo Forlani a top Christian Democrat 
Cossiga opted to reject Gorias resignation after consultations 
with leaders of the five parties in the coalition Only the 
opposition Communist Party sharply opposed the idea to reinstate 
him 
The plan was supported by Gorias dominant Christian Democrats 
and the Socialists the second largest party in the coalition 
which also included Republicans Social Democrats and Liberals 
In fact the Socialists have warned that unless Goria was 
reappointed the country might be forced to hold early elections 
Goria took office 6 months ago But from the start his ability 
to hold the fragile coalition together has been in doubt 
He resigned once before in November in a budget dispute with 
the tiny Liberal party But he was convinced by Cossiga to withdraw 
his resignation and continue as premier 
Gorias recent losses in the secret votes in the Chamber of 
Deputies the lower house of Parliament were due in part to 
factional fighting within his own party 
Analysts suggest some Christian Democrats are trying to 
undermine Goria to make party secretary Ciriaco De Mita the prime 
minister 
The leadership of the longdominant party is considered by many 
the most powerful post in Italy and some party insiders would like 
to move De Mita out of the post at the party congress in April by 
making him premier 
Other members of the party reportedly have voted against Goria 
secretly because they want to give Foreign Minister Giulio 
Andreotti the premiership for a sixth time
