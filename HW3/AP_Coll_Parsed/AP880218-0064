President Reagan asked Congress today to 
scratch dozens of programs from the military wish list and for the 
first time in his presidency to make significant cuts in the size 
of American forces 
Defense Secretary Frank C Carlucci in a lengthy annual report 
to Congress accompanying the presidents fiscal 1989 budget 
proposal said the administration was living up to the bargain it 
made with Congress last November setting new military spending 
limits 
Carlucci said the Pentagon believes the limits will force it 
to accept greater risks than we think wise 
We have done our best to apportion reductions in ways that 
minimize those risks We will reduce the size of our forces but 
the units we do field will have what they need to perform the tasks 
entrusted to them 
Carlucci said the combined activeduty forces of the Army Navy 
Air Force and Marine Corps will be reduced gradually this year to 
2138000 and then held at that level throughout fiscal 1989 
which begins on Oct 1 
That will represent a cut of about 34000 activeduty positions 
compared to the 2172000 that Congress authorized for this year 
and a cut of 46000 compared to the fiscal 1989 force the Pentagon 
had planned 
Reductions will be accommodated through attrition and reduced 
accessions recruiting Carlucci said 
The Air Force will diminish by roughly 23000 to about 576000 
The Army will lose about 8600 soldiers dropping to about 772000 
while the Marine Corps will lose about 2900 to about 197000 The 
Navy will hold steady at about 593000 
In addition the defense secretary said more than 10000 
civilian jobs would be cut in fiscal 1989 leaving a total of 
1102000 worldwide but reserve strength would hold steady at 
117 million 
The administrations priorities are unchanged Carlucci 
continued 
The Pentagon wants 455 billion for the Star Wars missile 
defense system compared to 355 billion this year wants to 
continue work on a railmobile version of the MX missile is 
requesting 14 billion for another Trident nuclear submarine and 
wants servicemen to receive a 43 percent pay raise instead of the 
2 percent planned for civilian government workers 
On the other hand Carlucci said the Army will deactivate a 
motorized infantry brigade at Fort Lewis Wash and cancel the 
scheduled activation of two light infantry battalions in Alaska 
the Navy will forego plans to stand up a 14th air wing at the 
Miramar Calif Naval Air Station and retire ships it wanted to 
keep and the Air Force will deactivate two fighter wings 
The fiscal 1989 budget totals for the Pentagon have been known 
for three months ever since the White House and Congress reached 
agreement on a twoyear deficitreduction package 
Under that compromise 2995 billion will be authorized for 
military programs in fiscal 1989 and 294 billion actually spent in 
outlays The difference represents authorized funding for longterm 
projects and weapons buying in future years 
The fiscal 1989 total is an increase over the 2914 billion in 
budget authority approved for this year but is unlikely to 
compensate for inflation Carlucci complained that fiscal 1989 will 
be the fourth consecutive year of negative real growth in 
military spending 
The Pentagon had asked for authority to spend 3324 billion in 
fiscal 1989 before the deficit compromise was adopted meaning 
dozens of military programs had to be revised 
According to Carlucci the result was that

The Army will retire 450 aging utility helicopters and 170 
scout copters cancel the Aquila surveillance drone program and 
stop production of Copperhead laserguided artillery shells cancel 
development of the AntiTactical Missile and develop only one new 
light helicopter instead of two 
The Navy will give up its goal of reaching a 600ship fleet in 
fiscal 1989 settling for 580 It will retire 16 frigates early 
deactivate one Poseidon missile submarine that had been scheduled 
for overhaul kill its new blimp program and cancel development of 
a new model of the Intruder attack jet the A6F 
The Air Force will deactivate the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing 
at Nellis Air Force Base and one other either the 401st Air Wing 
now in Spain or another one if a new European home is found for the 
401st It will reduce its operation of SR71 surveillance jets 
relying more on satellites cancel development of the ASAT 
satellitekiller rocket and delay certain space operations at 
Vandenberg Air Force Base 
Purchases of Air Force F15s and Marine AV8B jump jets will 
be cut back 
Carlucci said he would recommend to Congress that it kill 
development of the singlewarhead Midgetman nuclear missile But 
the Pentagon is requesting 200 million for the program in fiscal 
1989 to keep the missile alive long enough for the next 
administration to decide its fate he said
