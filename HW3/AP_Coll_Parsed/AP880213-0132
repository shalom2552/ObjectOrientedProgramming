Reading writing and arithmetic will join politics 
this week as Communist Party leaders meet to reform the countrys 
vast public education system and clarify the futures of two fallen 
proteges of Mikhail S Gorbachev 
The 300plusmember party Central Committee will convene in 
plenary session at a time when as the Soviet magazine New Times 
recently put it everyone seems dissatisfied with the present 
education system 
Gorbachev the partys general secretary since March 1985 has 
repeatedly urged improvements in education as part of his drive for 
perestroika or restructuring of society 
Education the 56yearold Soviet leader has said is key to 
improving Soviet technology and management and to making the 
country more competitive on world markets 
Changes made by the Central Committee in the countrys public 
education apparatus could have sweeping consequences for a large 
part of the Soviet populationThere are 40 million students and 3 
million teachers in the Soviet Union the official Tass news agency 
reported recently 
The date of the Central Committee meeting has not been 
officially announced but Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I 
Gerasimov said it would be held sometime this week 
The ruling Politburo which directs the partys work between 
plenary sessions of the Central Committee discussed education at a 
closeddoor meeting on Feb 4 but no details have been released 
The Central Committee is officially the partys policymaking 
body and is composed of top national officials local party bosses 
and Communists from the armed forces government ministries 
industry and agriculture 
By party rules it is the sole body empowered to make changes in 
the Politburo and this weeks session could see some changes in 
the ruling 13member body 
At the Central Committees last plenum on Oct 21 Gorbachev 
protege Boris N Yeltsin strongly criticized style of leadership 
and said the pace of reform was too slow Yeltsin 57 was removed 
as Moscow party leader on Nov 11 A week later he was given 
another job first deputy director of the state construction 
committee which made him a government official with the rank of 
minister 
Yeltsin was stripped of two lesser positions in the Moscow city 
government on Nov 14 Recent press articles have mentioned him 
without referring to his position as a nonvoting Politburo member 
This could indicate the Central Committee will formally strip 
Yeltsin of his Politburo post 
Another fallen Gorbachev ally and candidate Politburo member 
Nikolai V Talyzin is also in the spotlight Talyzin 59 was made 
head of the State Planning Committee in October 1985 but last 
June Gorbachev criticized him by name 
The next blow came Feb 6 when Tass announced that Talyzin had 
been relieved of his planning job and made chairman of the obscure 
Social Development Bureau The Central Committee now may sack 
Talyzin from his nonvoting post on the Politburo 
The committee could name immediate replacements for Yeltsin and 
Talyzin and add another voting Politburo member 
At its October session the committee dropped Politburo member 
Geidar A Aliev 54 who oversaw light industry and public 
transport and was the last man to rise to the ruling body under the 
patronage of President Leonid I Brezhnev 
Aside from personnel changes the Central Committee may set the 
agenda for the first nationwide conference of local Communist Party 
leaders to be held since the Stalin era Gorbachev has said the 
topics of the conference to be held in June will include 
electoral and judicial reforms 
The last party conference was held in February 1941 A party 
conference can be held between party congresses which take place 
every five years and Western observers believe Gorbachev will use 
the occasion to put his stamp even more firmly on the partys top 
bureaus 
From a Western perspective Soviet education appears extremely 
rigid with the curriculum for the countrys schools set by a 
central ministry in Moscow and little variation allowed at local 
schools In the classroom pupils are taught largely by the rote 
method and conformity is stressed 
They are discouraged from studying independently educating 
themselves and developing selfreliance New Times quoted Soviet 
educator Victor Tomashkevich as saying 
In the past Soviet officials stressed the nations 99 percent 
literacy rate and the states payment of all education costs for 
citizens Soviet education in the basic sciences and mathematics is 
regarded in the West as strong 
It is not known exactly what changes the Central Committee might 
make in the educational system but some of the ideas that have 
been floated in the press include more flexibility in determining 
the curricula and teaching method at the local level increasing 
teachers salaries and reducing class size 
One key to the countrys technological advancement computer 
training has already been made part of the basic education 
program but computers and qualified teachers are scarce Soviet 
officials acknowledge 
The Central Committee also could mandate changes in the Academy 
of Pedagogical Sciences which is in charge of training teachers 
The youth newspape Komsomolskaya Pravda lashed out at the 
academy on Feb 2 saying it has turned into social security for 
retired ministers directors and other nonfunctioning 
functionaries of education
