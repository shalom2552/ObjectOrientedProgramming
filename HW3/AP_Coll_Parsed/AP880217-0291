When foreign corporations and investors look at 
the United States these days they see a big For Sale sign 
The weak dollar relatively cheap US stock prices and fears of 
trade protectionism have escalated the already heady pace of 
foreign acquisitions of US companies 
While some US businesses and politicians are worried about the 
impact of the invasion many corporations are jumping to hook up 
with cashrich foreign suitors 
Were finding theres a lot of interest out there said Ian 
P Dunn a managing partner in New York with the British investment 
banker Samuel Montagu Inc Were working on a number of deals at 
the moment 
At the same time hostile foreign takeovers are expected to be a 
minority Aside from several highprofile hostile battles already 
waged this year foreign buyers mainly are expected to be 
businessoriented suitors interested in longterm benefits rather 
than quick profits 
Recent weeks have witnessed a miniwave of foreign buyouts In 
one of the biggest Firestone Tire and Rubber Co and Tokyobased 
Bridgestone Corp announced a joint venture by which Bridgestone 
would acquire 75 percent of Firestones global tire business the 
worlds fifthlargest for 1 billion 
A flurry of smaller deals also have surfaced including 
Bank of Tokyo Ltds acquisition of Union Bank of Los Angeles 
for 750 million from Britains Standard Chartered PLC 
British publisher Pearson PLCs 283 million purchase of the 
textbook publisher AddisonWesley Publishing Co 
The 36 million buyout of Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc a 
corporate image consultant by WPP Group PLC the British marketing 
firm that last year acquired advertising giant J Walter Thompson 
Co for 566 million 
Still being contested are two of the years biggest proposals 
BAT Industries PLCs hostile 42 billion offer for Farmers Group 
Inc and Torontobased Campeau Corps hostile 54 billion bid for 
Federated Department Stores Inc 
The 1988 buying spree had been expected following the rise of 
foreign buyouts in recent years Foreign buyers chiefly the 
British and Japanese spent an estimated 419 billion in 
acquiring 326 US companies in 1987 according to Mergers and 
Acquisitions magazine compared with 252 billion in 358 deals 
during 1986 and just 22 billion for 116 takeovers in 1983 
British buyers alone accounted for about 30 billion in US 
acquisitions last year such as British Petroleum Cos 78 
billion buyout of Standard Oil Co while the Japanese took in 
about 6 billion worth of purchases including Sony Corps 2 
billion acquisition of CBS Incs records business 
The speedup in foreign buyouts coincided with the sharp decline 
in the dollars value that has increased foreign buying power in 
the United States over the past two years The Japanese yens value 
has risen by about 100 percent against the dollar since early 1985 
and the British pound by 64 percent in that time 
Furthermore although US stock prices have rebounded somewhat 
from their lows following Octobers market crash they generally 
remain well below their peaks of last summer keeping the market 
prices of many American businesses at cutrate levels 
That presents a unique opportunity for foreign businesses to 
make longdesired strategic expansions into the United States 
Bridgestone for example would become a major US competitor for 
the first time through its Firestone venture 
Such considerations also make it likely that hostile deals will 
be the exception rather than the rule 
What the Japanese would like to establish over here is a 
significant presence a more efficient operation said Shuehei 
Sato head of US merchant banking for Japans Sanwa Bank In 
order to achieve that its necessary to have a good team of 
managers a good working relationship with workers or labor 
unions 
That could only be achieved in the Japanese managers mind at 
least by having friendly negotiations he said 
But along with those welcoming new foreign investment are 
critics warning against a tidal wave of foreign ownership ranging 
from members of Congress to Lee Iacocca the entrepreneurial 
chairman of Chrysler Corp 
Critics say foreign takeovers could cause the same problems they 
attribute to the domestic takeover wave of the 1980s including 
lost jobs a weakened industrial base and lost tax revenue 
Rep Byron Dorgan DND who already has proposed legislation 
to restrict domestic hostile takeovers has asked the General 
Accounting Office to examine the impact of foreign buyouts and the 
benefits that foreign corporations might enjoy in pursuing US 
companies 
Dorgan and others have said the laws of some countries such as 
Switzerland gave foreigners legal veils of secrecy and other unfair 
advantages in their attempts to buy US companies 
Were going to try to analyze what the threat is and what we 
might want to do in response to it Dorgan said in a telephone 
interview
