President Reagans hit list for congressional 
porkbarrel spending will be released next week but not as the 
cutback legislation he promised in his State of the Union address 
congressional sources said Wednesday 
Instead Reagans list of cuts will be made in a symbolic 
statement of what he would do if granted his longstanding wish for 
authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills The 
cuts would have no legal effect unless Congress takes up the cause 
Barbara Clay of the presidents Office of Management and Budget 
said she was not certain a decision had been made 
But Republiocan sources on Capitol Hill said OMB Director James 
C Miller III told them this week the list would not be in the form 
of rescission bills 
Its going to be a package of suggestions from the 
president said one GOP leadership aide speaking on condition of 
anonymity The new strategy could help avoid electionyear clashes 
with Republican lawmakers who won spending projects last year the 
aide said 
A highranking OMB official said the form of the request was not 
important Its how much noise you make The official who 
demanded annoymity said in either case he doubted Congress would 
go along 
The change in tactics appeared to be a retreat from the 
presidents nationally televised address last month The speech 
included a pitch for the lineitem veto which would allow him to 
reach into Congress mammoth spending legislation and cut out items 
he considered wasteful 
Reagan cited cranberry blueberry and crawfish research along 
with other items that he would cut if given the chance 
In 30 days I will send back to you those items as 
rescissions which if I had the authority to line them out I would 
do so the president told the Democraticcontrolled Congress 
The OMB has been drafting the list which could total 4 
billion Most of the targeted items were contained in the 600 
billion catchall spending bill approved at the end of last years 
session 
By proposing rescissions Reagan could freeze spending on those 
items for 45 days and give procedural advantages to those in 
Congress supporting his effort After the 45day period the 
spending would be restored unless the rescission were approved 
Any lawmaker is allowed to propose rescission legislation but 
without the presidents impetus the path to passage is more 
difficult
