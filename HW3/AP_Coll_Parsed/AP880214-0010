A man who threatened to blow himself up 
in a bar with dynamite hed strapped to his body was taken into 
custody by police early Sunday after four hours of negotiations 
Authorities later found no explosives 
John James Allgood 33 of Arlington walked out of the Plaza 
Lounge shirtless following police instructions and surrendered to 
authorities at about 1210 am said Arlington police spokesman 
Dee Anderson 
The officers did not find any explosives They did find a hoax 
device People in the bar had seen something so we knew Allgood had 
something Anderson said 
Bartender Ina Silloway said the man came into the bar shortly 
after 8 pm and walked around for a few minutes before ordering a 
12pack of beer to go When she returned with the beer she said 
he handed her a Valentines greeting card 
It said something to the effect of This is no joke I have 
six sticks of dynamite strapped to me If you look at me I will 
show you Ms Silloway said 
At that point I looked up and he showed me she said adding 
that the man told her he planned to commit police suicide 
Police say Allgood who was alone inside the bar threatened to 
harm no one but himself 
Police cordoned off the area but because other nearby 
businesses were closed Saturday night there was no need for any 
evacuation said officer Ken Burton 
Charges were pending against Allgood Anderson said but he 
would not specify what they involve
