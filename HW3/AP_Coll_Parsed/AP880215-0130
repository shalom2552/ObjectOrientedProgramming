Hundreds of snowbound motorists spent the 
night in their cars on farms and in National Guard armories when a 
blizzard clogged major roads for nearly 24 hours in southwestern 
Minnesota authorities said Monday 
We had numerous people a hundred would not be stretching it 
who spent the night away from home on farms in addition to the 
people who got to town and stayed there said Les Muck a State 
Patrol dispatcher in Marshall 
Less than an inch of snow actually fell but wind blowing up to 
45 mph picked up more than a foot of snow cover from the ground 
Sunday afternoon The blowing snow cut visibility to zero and piled 
up in drifts up to seven feet high Muck said 
The State Patrol closed about a 100mile stretch of Interstate 
90 from the South Dakota border to 10 miles east of Jackson on 
Sunday afternoon and did not reopen it until late Monday morning 
Muck said Several other highways and county roads also were closed 
during that period he said 
There were numerous multivehicle accidents with injuries but 
no fatalities were reported he said 
Elsewhere snow blown by wind gusting to 60 mph cut visibility 
and forced Wyoming police to close a 99mile stretch of Interstate 
80 between Cheyenne and Laramie for about four hours Monday morning 
More than 300 motorists sought shelter in Minnesota National 
Guard armories in Worthington Redwood Falls and Jackson Muck said 
The Worthington armory had travelers from as far away as 
Tennessee said National Guard 1st Sgt Ron Balster 
We got 200 furniture blankets from UHaul Balster said 
We got paper towels from Campbell Soup And people have brought 
in all kinds of food There are sandwiches chicken One person 
just brought in two gallons of milk 
We had 12 cars up here at one time fighting to get in the door 
for one room said Lucille Thorn manager of the Oxford Motel in 
Worthington 
Many people spent the night in motel lobbies and meeting rooms 
Tim and Julie Burns of Luverne and their three children ages 
11 months 5 years and 8 years were among those stranded on I90 
for hours before reaching the armory in Jackson 
Mrs Burns said traffic came to a standstill in near zero 
visibility Sunday afternoon about 10 miles east of Worthington 
We were on empty gas tank and I was really nervous about 
that and I told my husband we had to get to another car she said 
in a telephone interview from the armory Monday morning 
A couple from St Paul offered to let them get in their car 
so the five of us sat in the back of their car for almost nine 
hours just keeping warm Mrs Burns said They had a full 
tank 
Temperatures in the area were in the single digits Sunday 
afternoon and 0 to 10 below zero overnight with a wind chill of 20 
to 40 below the National Weather Service said 
Finally plows were able to clear the opposite side of the 
highway 
Around 1 am we saw cars going in the opposite direction and 
one of them stopped she said It was two guys from Sioux City 
Iowa and they said theyd take us to Jackson And with our 
kids we wanted to get out of the car and to the armory in Jackson 
where we had some space 
The family got to the armory around 3 am 
The low visibility and high drifts kept plows and rescue 
vehicles off many roads until early Monday said Lorren Simon 
another patrol dispatcher in Marshall 
Finding stranded travelers is a frustrating process he 
said You cant use strong enough language on them Theyll go 
out anyway and then they think the public officials should come out 
and rescue them when you cant go up and down the road They get 
real perturbed when someone doesnt go out there 
Muck said it appeared that all motorists who stayed in their 
cars overnight made it out safely when the roads were reopened 
Monday morning Weve gotten no calls that anybody is missing 
he said 
Strong wind also hit sections of northwestern and western 
Minnesota on Sunday forcing the patrol to close I94 at Fergus 
Falls and US 10 in Detroit Lakes for a time But outside of 
southwestern Minnesota the wind died down overnight in most areas 
of the state
