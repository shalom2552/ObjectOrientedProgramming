Democratic primary

Well live to fight another day Bob Dole who beat Bush 
21 in Iowa last week but lost to him in New Hampshire 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
The only thing we didnt carry was the Boston suburbs 
Democrat Richard Gephardt who finished a distant second to 
Dukakis barely edging out Paul Simon

This is not helping Paul Simon on the difference his 
slim loss to Gephardt will make in his fundraising efforts

This has been a terrific evening for us here in New 
Hampshire Republican Pete du Pont who picked up 10 percent in 
New Hampshire putting him roughly in a tie for last with Pat 
Robertson among Republicans 
</TEXT>

I dont think he was the winner Dole won by coming within 10 
points There was no question that George Bush should have done at 
least 20 points better than any other candidate Alexander 
Haig who dropped out of the GOP race last week and threw his 
support to Dole 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
On to the South where were going to rise again Bush

Thank you New Hampshire Bush again
