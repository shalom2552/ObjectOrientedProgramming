Cardinal John OConnor says mail criticizing his 
decision to set up a scholarship fund for blacks reflects 
deepseated racism 
OConnor read 10 letters from critics on Sunday in St Patricks 
Cathedral at a packed Mass celebrating Black History Month 
We may not realize it but deep in our consciousness there is 
racism the Roman Catholic Archbishop said 
The letters ranged from threats to withhold financial support 
from the church to anger to what one writer referred to as special 
treatment for black people OConnor 68 said he will answer each 
letter 
One writer accused OConnor of stirring up racism Someone 
else suggested that the money should go to white people with large 
families they are trying to put through parochial schools 
OConnor announced last month that he would donate his Social 
Security checks 6000 to 7000 per year to the scholarship 
fund
