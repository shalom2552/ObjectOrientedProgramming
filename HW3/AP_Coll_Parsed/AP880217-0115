Bob Dole said today that he made a mistake in 
not responding to charges from George Bush in the closing hours of 
the New Hampshire primary campaign but aides promised Dole would 
react very very forcefully to future attacks 
The Senate Republican leader looking to recover from a big loss 
in the Granite State Tuesday vowed to correct what he said are the 
lies in Bushs campaign ads 
Im going to try to go out and straighten it out Im not 
going to run from it Im not known for running from a fight 
Dole said at the Manchester airport before flying to Washington 
I never said I was going to raise your taxes I didnt say I was 
advocating a 10abarrel import fee But thats what Bushs ads 
say and they are not true 
Flying back to take part in the Senate debate on campaign 
financing Dole was asked if he had been too soft on Bush 
Probably Dole told reporters on the plane 
And queried on whether he should have not let Bushs charges go 
unanswered Dole said Yes thats my guess 
Dole said in Manchester that he thought he had done well to 
finish second against Bush in a state the vice president says is 
his neighbor But he said the boost he got out of his Iowa victory 
on Feb 8 was overrated 
I think our expectations got out of hand Dole said I 
think we sat on our hands for three days 
Dole brushed aside suggestions that he would now return to the 
style of the mean old Bob Dole saying the nation is seeing a 
mean George Bush 
Theyve got the axes and they seem to be swinging them in 
every state Dole said 
William Brock Doles campaign manager underscored the new 
forcefulness the campaign plans against Bush attacks 
When he does it from now on were going to respond very very 
forcefully Brock said on the plane Were tired of it Were 
sick to the gills of this type of tactic 
But Brock said the campaign would not respond in kind 
negative against negative 
Were not going to play their game Were not going to put up 
with the effort to distort the record Brock told reporters We 
dont have to wallow in the mud with them to answer their charges 
When they are wrong we are going to point it out 
Although Bushs convincing victory Tuesday night blunted Doles 
postIowa momentum Dole and his aides forced a positive face on 
the New Hampshire results 
But the frustration was apparent when Dole and Bush were 
interviewed from different locations by Tom Brokaw of NBC 
After Bush wished Dole well as the campaigns moved south Dole 
made his sharp comment referring to lastday television ads by the 
Bush campaign that claimed Dole supports tax increases and Social 
Security cuts 
You shouldnt distort someones record Dole said I could 
do that to him but I wont 
He vowed to straighten out my record It wont take long 
For the campaign of a sitting Republican vice president to 
engage in the kind of base distortions of this weekend is demeaning 
to that office and demeaning to our party said Sen Warren 
Rudman of New Hampshire a key Dole backer 
Doles own big win in Iowa last week had helped boost his 
standing in New Hampshire polls Once 20 points behind he pulled 
even a few days before the voting 
But the drive faltered and Tuesday nights results left the 
Senate minority leader at 29 percent nine points behind Bush 
Dole was still 16 points ahead of the next GOP contender Rep 
Jack Kemp and Dole and his aides insisted Tuesday night that 
Bushs victory was nothing to crow about 
Obviously we would have liked to have won here Dole said 
We didnt quite do that but we did a lot 
Brock said We were down more than 20 points eight days ago 
and to have come this close that is a tremendous commentary on 
Bob Dole Its also a commentary on the softness of the vice 
presidents supporters 
But he also indicated that the tone of the campaign is likely to 
change saying Bush has 21 days to start telling the truth and 
dealing with issues and were going to give him a countdown day 
by day
