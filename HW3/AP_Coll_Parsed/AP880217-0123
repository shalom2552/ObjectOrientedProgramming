Nineyearold Kendall Smith smiling and 
carrying a new musical keyboard under his arm walked out of the 
hospital today more than a month after he fell into a pond and was 
trapped 40 minutes under the ice 
Hes a normal kid and hes going to go back to doing the 
normal things Dr Karen Powers told reporters at a news 
conference 
Were all humbled as caretakers to see what many of us would 
consider if not miraculous a nearmiraculous recovery added 
Fred Tecklenburg another of Kendalls attending physicians at the 
Medical University of South Carolina Hospital 
He said Kendall who lives in Dillon is one of about five 
children in the medical literature to have recovered after having 
been under water for more than 30 minutes 
Kendall wearing black jeans with suspenders a blue striped 
shirt and a white hat was asked how he felt Good he said and 
smiled shyly He said he knew he would have to go back to school 
but said he wasnt quite ready for that 
In addition to the keyboard donated by a electronics store 
Kendall also received a bicycle from a store 
Ms Powers said Kendall might need more therapy to build his 
strength and endurance and might start back at school on a halfday 
schedule Tecklenburg added Kendall tested at his age level on 
standardized tests administered about 10 days ago 
Kendall and two other children were playing on the frozen 
surface of a pond Jan 12 when the ice gave way His companions 
were rescued quickly but it was almost 40 minutes before rescuers 
pulled Kendall out with grappling hooks 
Doctors have said the time he spent under the water is as long 
as has been recored for anyone who has survived a neardrowning In 
icy water the bodys metabolism slows and the brain doesnt need 
as much oxygen 
The reflex is particularly powerful in children doctors say 
Kendall was in a coma for two weeks but when he regained 
consciousness made dramatic improvement
