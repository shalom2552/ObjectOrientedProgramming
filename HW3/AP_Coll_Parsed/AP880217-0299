President Reagans fiscal 1989 budget cites 
few signs of serious damage to the economy from last years 
stock market plunge in outlining programs to reduce the budget 
deficit to 1295 billion budget documents showed Wednesday 
Reagans spending outline to be formally submitted on Thursday 
will propose record spending of 109 trillion in the fiscal year 
that begins next Oct 1 against 9647 billion in receipts 
according to a portion of the document obtained by The Associated 
Press 
If the policies proposed in this budget are adhered to the 
deficit will decline steadily in future years Reagan said in the 
budget report to Congress 
The spending proposal likely to produce the least contentious 
budget debate of the Reagan presidency because it adheres to a 
budget pact struck last year with Congress proposes a 207 
billion reduction from last years spending shortfall of 1502 
billion 
The GrammRudman budgetbalancing law calls for a budget deficit 
of no more than 136 billion in fiscal 1989 which begins next Oct 
1 
However many private economists contend that the deficit will 
be higher next year even with the steps expected to be outlined in 
the new budget including the smallest defense spending increase 
ever sought by Reagan 
The new budget report concedes that the new Reagan spending plan 
assumes a declining rate of inflation and falling interest 
rates for both 1988 and 1989 
The budget document calls last Octobers stock market collapse 
startling and cites many predictions that the economy would 
soon suffer a downturn or even a return of the Great Depression 
Although it is too soon to determine what the final effects 
will be the initial fears now seem greatly exaggerated the 
budget report states 
Despite the sharp reversal in stock prices the economy has 
shown few signs of serious damage it adds 
The new Reagan budget assumes that the economy will grow in 1988 
by 24 percent and by 35 percent in 1989 However the budget 
report states that a percentage point lower growth even with no 
change in other economic data could drive up the deficit by an 
additional 63 billion in 1988 and 18 billion in 1989 
Reagans new budget document projects that the deficit in the 
current fiscal year fiscal 1988 will total 1467 billion with 
1055 trillion in spending and 9092 billion in receipts 
It projects that the deficit after declining to 1295 billion 
in 1989 will ease to 1042 billion in 1990 to 793 billion in 
1991 and to 511 billion in 1992 
The Reagan budget cited expected improvements in exports 
leading to a welcome resurgence of the nations industrial 
sector as the main source of economic strength in the coming 
years 
The eighth and for practical purposes final Reagan budget 
takes note of the fact that Reagans initial budget plan submitted 
in 1981 was expected to achieve a balanced budget by 1985 
Instead the budget has been in deficit Reducing the deficit 
is one of the nations central economic policy concerns 
A key reason why the budget still isnt balanced Reagans new 
budget report suggests is the drain on the economy of the deep 
198182 recession as well as the fact that Congress has been 
unwilling to approve domestic spending cuts he proposed 
Many of these proposed Reagan reductions were expected to be 
included in the 11 trillion fiscal blueprint being unveiled 
Thursday including proposals for transferring government functions 
including parks management and perhaps Amtrak railroad service to 
private industry 
But the plan also was being crafted to comply with the spending 
agreement reached last fall in the budget summit between Reagan 
and congressional leaders 
Since the budget summit agreement spells out overall spending 
and tax levels including allocations for the military domestic 
programs and foreign aid this years battles were expected to 
focus on the details rather than the thrust of the budget 
priorities 
The pact should help smooth the budgets path through Congress 
since the balance between domestic and military spending totals is 
annually one of the most difficult 
In addition Democratic leaders have pledged to speed the 
process and avoid packing all spending into a single massive bill 
as they did in a 600 billion measure last year 
When Reagan pledged in his State of the Union address never 
again to sign such legislation he was preaching to a choir 
already converted House Majority Leader Thomas Foley DWash 
said this week 
In addition to the requirements of the budget agreement the 
administration is proposing about 14 billion in sales of 
government assets and privatization initiatives to drop the 
deficit to 1295 billion 
The fiscal 1987 deficit was 1504 billion and red ink this 
year is expected to drop to 1467 billion according to 
administration estimates 
The administrations estimates which are more optimistic than 
those of the Congressional Budget Office would normally provoke 
widespread charges of cooking the books for the 
Democraticcontrolled Congress However the revised GrammRudman 
law requires that administration estimates be used in determining 
whether the budget meets its goals 
Rep William H Gray III DPa chairman of the House Budget 
Committee said Wednesday he was concerned about Congress using too 
rosy a set of figures But he added unduly pessimistic 
assumptions could produce unnecessary battles over additional 
spending cuts or tax increases that in this election year might 
achieve nothing
