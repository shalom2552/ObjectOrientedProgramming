There was no question the Danish 
supertanker Kate Maersk had a gaping hole in its hull that a 
crewman was dead that the burning and crippled ship needed to be 
towed from the Persian Gulf 
But the question that perplexed the gulf shipping community is 
one that has become increasingly characteristic of the increasingly 
confusing IranIraq war Which nation staged the attack 
Its confusing and it will grow more confusing said a 
Dubaibased shipping executive who spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to company rules Both sides are diversifying the style 
of the attacks and the weapons they have been using 
Initially the gulf shipping community almost unanimously 
considered the tanker a victim of an Iranian raid on Thursday It 
was a logical target for Iran which attacks neutral vessels in 
retaliation for Iraqs attacks on Iranian tankers 
It also left the sort of damage characteristic of Iranian 
Silkworm missiles 
But by Sunday the prevailing opinion among shipping executives 
was that the ship was the victim of an Iraqi raid the latest 
perhaps in a series of errant Iraqi missile attacks 
The executives said a key clue came on Friday when an Iraqi jet 
bomber a Sovietmade Badger fired two C601 missiles within eight 
miles of the destroyer USS Chandler which was escorting a convoy 
of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers The Navy began escorting the 
tankers last July to protect them from Iran which considers Kuwait 
an ally of Iraq in the sevenyear IranIraq war 
The Iraqis werent known previously to have had the C601s an 
airtoground version of the antiship Silkworms favored by Iran 
Iraq normally uses Frenchbuilt Exocet missiles 
Such changing weaponry on both sides and the propensity for 
mistaken targets is clouding the gulf picture Iran for example 
until lately has relied mainly on speedboats equipped with guns to 
stage its attacks 
But earlier this month a USmade Phantom jet of Irans made a 
sudden reapearance on the gulf the first Iranian jet spotted in 
the region in a year and a half 
Shipping executives also believe Iranians now possesses 
substantial numbers of USdesigned Mavericks an airtosurface 
missile that can cause as much damage as the missiles used by Iraq 
The Iranians also have equipped frigates with Italianmade 
Seakiller missiles which can cause more damage to a ships hull 
than cannon shells rocketpropelled grenades or machine guns that 
their speedboats normally use 
And they have the Silkworms deployed at the southern and 
northern extremities of the gulf but mobile and therefore 
effective from any point along the 600mile gulf coast 
But mistaken targets are what US officers said they fear most 
in the gulf 
Last May 17 an Iraqi missile strike killed 37 Americans aboard 
the USS Stark a frigate Iraq said the attack was a mistake and 
the United States accepted its apology 
On Feb 7 US military officers said the battle cruiser 
Richmond K Turner had a tense moment when the the firing and 
subsequent explosion of what was believed to be an Iraqi missile 
could be viewed from the ship 
There have been other instances in which Iraqi missiles fired 
from long range at a mere radar blip have wound up devastating 
ships linked to their Arab allies such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia 
Iraq also once blasted a fishing trawler 
The Iranians arent immune from mistakes On Jan 22 Iran 
attacked the Norwegianowned Havpil as it headed toward the Iranian 
port of Bandar Abbas with a shipment of refined petroleum products 
that were in fact for Iran 
So with the weapons changing and not necessarily being pointed 
in the right direction the gulf shipping community has now become 
more cautious about determining who is shooting what and why 
We tend to immediately say its an Iranian attack once a 
victim of the tanker war is related to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait or 
when the location of the attack is away from the Iranian shipping 
lanes but we are growing more careful now said the Dubai 
executive
