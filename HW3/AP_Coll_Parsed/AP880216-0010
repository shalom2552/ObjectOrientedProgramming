Rep Barney Frank who acknowledged last year 
that he is a homosexual is busy raising money for his reelection 
campaign while the Republican Party is still looking for someone to 
oppose him 
At this point the only Republican publicly talking of running 
against the liberal Massachusetts Democrat is a conservative gadfly 
who withdrew from the 1986 Massachusetts gubernatorial race after 
admitting he had lied about his military record 
I dont know what the Republicans plan to do about it but the 
reading we have from polling is that voters care about 
performance in office and not personal issues like sexual 
preference Frank said And thats certainly consistent with the 
reading Ive gotten from people 
Massachusetts Democrats say the homosexual disclosure will have 
little impact on voters who have sent Frank to Congress with 
increasingly convincing victory margins 52 percent 60 percent 
74 percent and 89 percent 
And they note that the disclosure was not news to many 
constituents 
Republicans however are talking about how Frank could be 
defeated in the states 4th District which includes Democratic 
strongholds on the outskirts of Boston upperclass Republican 
enclaves like Wellesley and mill towns like Fall River near the 
Rhode Island border 
Joe Malone executive director of the state GOP said the 
homosexual issue could be exploited by a Republican challenger not 
by attacking Franks sexual preference but by telling voters he is 
focusing too heavily on gay issues at the expense of other 
congressional work 
Ive always thought its a case of how the congressman votes 
and if his sexuality slants his voting in such a way that he no 
longer represents his district Malone said 
In many cases he has chosen to pursue issues that have an 
effect on the gay community to the detriment of issues that affect 
the typical constituent in his district he added 
However Malone could not immediately provide any examples And 
Franks supporters point to his work on several major bills in 1987 
to counter that argument 
They credit him with playing major roles in passage of a measure 
requiring that any lowincome federal housing demolished under 
urban renewal be replaced a bill requiring a special prosecutor be 
appointed to investigate alleged wrongdoing by administration 
figures and legislation prohibiting the government from denying 
visas based on politics 
While Republicans talk about Franks vulnerability there is no 
declared candidate with the election nine months away The only 
politician publicly considering a challenge to Frank is Royall 
Switzler who would carry considerable political baggage into any 
race 
Switzler made a name for himself by taking on leaders of the 
Democraticcontrolled Massachusetts House often alone during 
his years in the state Legislature 
The Massachusetts GOP enlisted Switzler in 1986 to run against 
popular Democratic Gov Michael Dukakis but he was forced to bow 
out after admitting he was a sergeant in peacetime Korea not a 
Green Beret captain in Vietnam 
Frank 47 is taking nothing for granted 
Campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show 
that his spending and fundraising in 1987 were more than double 
his campaign receipts and expenditures during 1985 the last 
nonelection year 
The fourthterm congressman raised 144300 during 1987 
compared to 71400 in 1985 He spent 106400 last year compared 
to 49800 in 1985 
Frank also paid 7000 for an October poll to measure voter 
reaction to the disclosure of his homosexuality 
The general finding is that overwhelmingly people in the 
district will judge me on how I do my job as a member of Congress 
and not anything else Frank said
