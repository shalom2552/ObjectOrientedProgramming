Houston Lighting amp Power Co officials 
say they will pay without protest a 75000 fine imposed by the 
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission for violations at the South 
Texas Nuclear Project 
HLampP managers of the estimated 5 billion plant said the 
penalty would not affect customers rates company spokesman Glen 
Walker said Friday 
Its not unusual for them to levy a fine Walker said We 
knew there was a possibility they would 
The utility has 30 days to pay the civil penalty or to protest 
it according to NRC spokesman Frank Ingram 
The violations occurred last October and November while the 
plants Unit I was doing prestartup testing but before it had 
begun power operations Ingram said Friday 
The problems which have been resolved did not threaten public 
safety and had no impact on the plants schedule Walker said 
Officials are planning to fire up the reactor in Unit 1 on Feb 24 
and then ask the NRC for a fullpower operating license about two 
weeks later 
At one point Ingram said three valves were closed disabling 
an emergency core cooling system and violating a plant license 
requirement that at least two of the valves be open when the plant 
is in the hot shutdown mode 
In a letter to HLampP dated Thursday Robert D Martin NRC 
regional administrator in Arlington said the violation involving 
the closed valves was significant because the condition existed for 
51 hours before it was discovered 
NRC will follow up on the companys longterm corrective 
measures during future inspections Ingram said
