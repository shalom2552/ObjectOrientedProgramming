A British group said Friday it could not afford to 
buy a secondhand Spitfire for a new World War II museum in France 
More than 20000 of the famous British fighters were built and 
saw service from 19381954 The wartime cost of a Spitfire was 
5000 pounds then about 24000 
There arent many Spitfires left and when the French asked us 
to try to get one we were told the cost would be 300000 pounds 
522000 or more We couldnt face up to that said Lt Gen 
Sir Ian Harris 
Haris British support committee for the Memorial Museum of the 
Battle of Normandy at Caen is now trying to raise the equivalent of 
87000 to buy a secondhand Typhoon fighterbomber 
Its not a bad substitute Harris said 
Harris 77 was the first British regimental commander to enter 
Caen on July 9 1944 He spoke at a news conference to announce his 
committees appeal for a total of 261000 for the museum 
The money will pay for British war relics ranging from a 
Churchill tank to a miniature radio transmitter used by 
intelligence agents landed before the invasion of France on June 6 
1944 
Its somewhat disconcerting that while it was British troops 
who first entered Caen other countries whose forces were never in 
the city are giving the museum substantially more importance and 
support than we are Harris said 
He said that in the United States for example 300000 members 
of a Normandy Society plan to support the museum project 
Troops from Germany and 11 allied countries fought in the 78day 
battle around Caen and nearly 300000 soldiers were killed 
Caen 115 miles west of Paris suffered 10000 civilian deaths 
Caen Mayor JeanMarie Girault flew to London for the news 
conference at the Imperial War Museum 
He said France is spending nearly 21 million on the museum that 
will be opened on the June 6 anniversary 
The nations involved in the battle have been invited to send 
representatives for the opening the mayor said 
He said those countries were France East and West Germany 
Belgium Britain Canada Czechoslovakia Greece Luxembourg the 
Netherlands Norway Poland and the United States
