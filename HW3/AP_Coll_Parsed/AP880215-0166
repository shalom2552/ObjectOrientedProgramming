A Miami businessman who has accused top Haitian 
government officials of involvment in cocaine trafficking said 
Monday he was going public with details on the charges because of 
two attempts on his life 
Osvaldo Quintana 35 said at a news conference that he 
personally arranged a cocaine shipment with Haitian army Col 
JeanClaude Paul the powerful commander of the key batallion in 
PortauPrince the nations capital 
Quintana said he knew of involvement by higher Haitian 
officials including those in the ruling government council but 
refused to give any names 
His attorney Ellis Rubin said he was trying to arrange for 
Quintana to testify before the same US Senate committee 
investigating alleged drug smuggling by Panamas military 
strongman Gen Manuel Antonio Noriega 
Rubin said Quintana who operated a seafood company before 
becoming involved with drugs has testified before a federal grand 
jury in Miami investigating Haitian drug connections including 
Pauls role 
Sources in the US attorneys office have told The Associated 
Press on condition of anonymnity that a grand jury here is 
investigating Haitian officials allegedly involved in drug 
trafficking The Miami Herald has identified Paul as a target of 
the investigation 
The colonel was the one who supplied us with the landing 
field the equipment the whole thing said Quintana He said he 
met with Paul to arrange a 100kilogram cocaine shipment in 
December 1986 
We flew the shipment out of his own personal ranch in 
Haiti said Quintana The cocaine was flown from the ranch 90 
miles outside of PortauPrince through the Bahamas to Florida he 
said 
Quintana was eventually turned in to the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration by the owner of a plane he hired he said and then 
agreed to cooperate with the DEA 
After testifying in a trial here last month Quintana told 
reporters he had once seen 9000 kilograms or 19800 pounds of 
cocaine in duffel bags in the palace of Haitis 
thenpresidentforlife JeanClaude Duvalier before he was 
deposed in early 1986 
Quintana said Monday he was twice tracked by apparent Haitian 
hit squads including one that followed him to the DEA office in 
Miami 
That group was arrested when they were spotted waiting outside 
the DEA office he said but were released a few days later Two 
months later a second group ran him off a highway Those men were 
frightened away by a Florida Highway Patrol officer who happened 
by said Quintana 
Rubin said Quintana was warned by the US attorneys office in 
Miami in January that he would not get into the federal Witness 
Protection Program if he talked to the media about the case 
But since then no protection has been arranged for him or his 
family Rubin said 
Weve given the federal government four weeks in which to do 
something for Mr Quintana said Rubin They have not done so 
Assistant US Attorney William Norris who heads Miamis major 
drug traffickers prosecution section confirmed Monday that 
Quintana has been a source of information and is a potential 
witness but refused to say if the investigation involved Haiti 
He said the US attorneys office was not in a position to 
promise protection for Quintana because that program is handled by 
the US Marshals Service 
Messages seeking comment from the Miami DEA office were not 
answered by midafternoon Monday 
Rubin blamed the lack of action for his client on a division in 
the US government on whether to proceed against Haitian officials 
and possibly destabilize a friendly government 
It does no good to expose narcotics coming from Panama 
Colombia Honduras unless you also shut off the Haitian 
connection the attorney said 
Quintana testified here last month for the defense in the trial 
of selfstyled HaitianAmerican freedom fighter Joel Deeb who was 
on trial on weapons violations charges in a plot to overthrow the 
Haitian government
