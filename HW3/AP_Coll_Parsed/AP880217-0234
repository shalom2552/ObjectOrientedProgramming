lawsuit of trying to kill his wife was served with court papers as 
he and a female companion tried to flee in California a newspaper 
reported Tuesday 
A process server slipped a copy of the lawsuit under the 
windshield wipers of a car as Walker Railey and Lucy Papillon a 
Dallas psychologist sped away from a northern California resort 
Monday the Dallas Times Herald said 
The parents of Raileys wife Margaret Peggy Railey filed 
the lawsuit Feb 2 accusing their soninlaw of the attempted 
strangulation The suit seeks unspecified damages 
Mrs Railey has been in a coma since she was left for dead on 
the floor of the familys garage April 22 She is in a Tyler 
nursing home 
Railey denies attacking his wife He has said he was studying at 
two libraries and came home to find his wife on the floor 
Several lawyers told the newspaper that they believe placing the 
papers under the windshield wipers would be considered a proper 
service They said they didnt know of any case with the same 
circumstances but that visibility was the key in serving a lawsuit 
Railey former minister of the First United Methodist Church of 
Dallas and Ms Papillon who reportedly told a Dallas County grand 
jury that she and Railey traveled together and once discussed 
marriage were spotted at 2 pm Sunday at a Mendocino Calif inn 
by process server Steve Adams of San Francisco and a Dallas Times 
Herald reporter 
The couple were drinking beer outside their 140anight cabin 
when they spotted the process server and reporter 
Railey and Ms Papillon ran inside and remained there for 22 
hours the newspaper said They did not turn on any lights and had 
food delivered by room service and instructed inn employees to put 
through telephone calls only from certain individuals 
On Monday a resort employee carried their luggage to their 
rented car Ms Papillon walked out of the cabin got into the car 
and Railey darted from the cabin with a coat over his head 
Railey slumped down in the front seat as the car sped out of the 
driveway Adams ran alongside the car identified himself as a 
process server and placed the papers under the windshield wipers 
the newspaper said 
Railey told The Dallas Morning News in an interview late last 
week that he was not attempting to avoid the legal papers and was 
keeping a low profile to avoid the press 
But Railey and Ms Papillon declined to answer the door at the 
cabin when Adams knocked and identified himself as a process server 
Railey has until the first Monday after the expiration of 20 
days since being served to answer the charges in the suit said 
Bill Arnold attorney for Mrs Raileys parents
