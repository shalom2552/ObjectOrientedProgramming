Abu Nidals radical Palestinian guerrilla 
group on Saturday denounced as blackmail and a disgrace an 
Italian court verdict that convicted him of masterminding a 1985 
bombing attack at Rome airport 
The verdict is an attempt to overshadow the glorious uprising 
of our people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli 
occupation It is a disgrace to Italian justice said a statement 
issued by Abu Nidals FatahRevolutionary Council faction 
The statement was issued in Beirut a day after a Rome court 
handed down the conviction verdict and sentenced Abu Nidal in 
absentia to life in prison 
Sixteen people were killed and more than 80 injured in the 
grenade and rifle fire attack at Rome airport on Dec 27 1985 An 
almost simultaneous bombing attack at Vienna airport killed four 
people and wounded 47 
The statement signed by Atef Abu Bakr the groups chief 
spokesman accused the Italian judiciary of bias 
Italian justice closes its eyes to the crimes Israel is 
committing against our people in the occupied territories These 
crimes place Israel on the top of the terrorists list it said 
Why has Italian justice failed to make any move when Israeli 
secret agents assassinated several Palestinian leaders on Italian 
soil Isnt that evidence that Italian justice covers up for 
Israeli crimes Isnt that blackmail the statement said without 
elaborating 
Abu Nidal whose real name is Sabri alBanna is a former 
official of Yasser Arafats Fatah group He split with Arafat in 
early 1970s and heads the Fatah Revolutionary Council His group is 
not part of Arafats Palestine Liberation Organization
