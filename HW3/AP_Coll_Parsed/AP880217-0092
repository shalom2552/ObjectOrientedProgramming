Republican Jack Kemp armed with a 
thirdplace New Hampshire finish ahead of Pat Robertson predicted 
today that he would continue to do well against his fellow 
conservative in the Southern primaries 
Robertson is certainly a conservative but a rather negative 
conservative Kemp said I dont think Pat Robertson can 
ultimately be the candidate of the conservative South 
Kemp interviewed on ABCTVs Good Morning America 
celebrated his finish ahead of former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont 
and Robertson as a victory in a race for the conservatives in 
the Republican Party 
He said that race was separate from the race for the 
traditional moderate wing of the party between Vice President 
George Bush and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole 
Id like George and Bob to withdraw he added wryly 
Final unofficial results from Tuesdays firstinthenation 
primary gave Kemp 13 percent of the vote placing him behind Bush 
who had 38 percent and Dole at 29 percent Du Pont and Robertson 
each received 10 percent with du Pont slightly ahead 
The New York congressman called the results a victory 
particularly after Robertsons surprise secondplace finish in the 
Iowa caucuses 
Theres two contests in this party Kemp his family at his 
side told about 400 supporters at a hotel ballroom bedecked with 
red white and blue balloons 
Theres the contest for the establishment wing of the 
Republican Party and there is a contest for the conservative wing 
We won the contest for the conservative wing 
And the thing thats happening now and you can feel it right 
here in New Hampshire finally weve dragged Bush and Dole out of 
discussing their resumes and their tax returns and where theyre 
born and into discussing issues 
With you and the type of folks that you represent around this 
country ladies and gentlemen the growth hope and opportunity 
wing of the Republican Party is going to prevail over the orthodox 
statusquo wing of our party Kemp said 
Kemp campaign adviser Roger Stone said the thirdplace finish 
would help Kemp substantially in the South 
As the agenda moves South its the most conservative part of 
the country and we think his message will be well accepted 
there Stone said 
A former pro football player whos a strong anticommunist and 
is strong on defense issues is better for the South than a 
Connecticut Yankee son of a Wall Street banker he said 
referring to Bush 
Stone said the campaign has about 100000 on hand and a list of 
100000 donors nationwide He predicted that Tuesdays results will 
increase Kemps ability to raise funds
