A member of Israels Parliament arrived in 
Athens on Friday to join Palestinian deportees in a planned voyage 
back to Israel but two organizers said they still had not obtained 
a ship 
The president of Greeces main seamens union meanwhile said 
Israeli agents had used threats and pressure to block the 
PLOsponsored trip that would carry 130 Palestians deported by 
Israel to the Israeli port of Haifa 
Union leader Antonis Dalakogiorgis also revealed that the 
Israeli Sea Officers Union had warned they would boycott Greek 
vessels if Greek seamen continued backing the PLO effort 
The journey of return is designed to focus attention on 
Israels use of deportations to punish Palestinians in the 
territories it captured in the 1967 ArabIsraeli war 
Parliament member Mohammed Miari appeared at a news conference 
at an Athens hotel alongside Bassam Abu Sharif the chief spokesman 
for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat 
Miari a member of the leftwing Progressive List for Peace 
said he was told that the Israeli government will put on trial 
all those who participate in the trip and said there were moves 
in Parliament to strip him of his parliamentary immunity 
Two other parliament members Tawfiq Zaiad and Charlie Biton 
were among 11 Israelis who arrived Thursday in Cyprus to join the 
voyage when it stops there About 20 Israelis plan to make the trip 
The trip is modeled after the voyage of the Exodus which tried 
to take Jewish refugees to Palestine in 1947 but was turned back by 
British authorities Miriam Algazi one of the Israelis who arrived 
in Cyprus on Thursday also took part in the Exodus voyage 
At the news conference Miari backed the right of the deported 
Palestinians people to return to their homeland 
He said he hoped the trip would open a new window for just 
peace in the Middle East 
But there was increasing doubt that any ship would be able to 
sail soon although the PLO has gathered hundreds of deportees 
observers and journalists in Athens and Cyprus to take part 
Two members of the ninemember voyage steering committee in 
Athens told The Associated Press that the PLO did not have a firm 
contract to charter a vessel because several companies had backed 
out of tentative commitments 
We dont have a boat yet said AbdulJawad Saleh the 
deported mayor of the West Bank town of Bireh 
There is not a concrete ship as of this moment said another 
member of the steering committee who insisted on anonymity 
The voyage was initially scheduled to start on Tuesday but the 
PLO diplomatic representative in Athens Fouad AlBittar said 
Thursday the voyage had been delayed because many shipowners 
had backed away from contracts 
However he then promised that the voyage would begin by early 
Saturday morning from Greeces main Piraeus harbor saying a boat 
had been found 
We are still insisting that the boat will sail Abu Sharif 
said Friday He reaffirmed the time schedule given by Bittar but 
added an element of uncertainty 
Im sure we will find and have found according to Mr 
Bittar a brave captain for the voyage he said 
Piraeus harbor authority officials said at noon Friday the PLO 
had not submitted documents legally required 24 hours before a ship 
can be brought in or out 
Dalakogiorgis president of the Panhellenic Union of Merchant 
Seamen said that Israeli agents had threatened Greek shipping 
companies and individual seamen about the voyage 
Seamen working on ships that the PLO might have chartered 
received telephone threats from the Israelis and shipping companies 
were also under intense pressure from them Dalakogiorgis said 
I personally received threatening phone calls threatening my 
life not to proceed with this Dalakogiorgis said 
Dalakogiorgis distributed copies of a telex from the Israeli Sea 
Officers Union saying we would have no choice but to boycott 
Greek vessels in Israeli ports if the voyage goes as planned 
No one from the Israeli union headquartered in Haifa could be 
found for comment Friday 
Shipping sources in Piraeus speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the captain of the first ship chartered to make the voyage had 
also been threatened 
They said that Zannes Kouloumbis of the Malteseflagged Silver 
Paloma was warned of an Israeli attack during the voyage and told 
his life was in danger 
The ships owners who operate a regular ferry service to 
Israel dropped out
