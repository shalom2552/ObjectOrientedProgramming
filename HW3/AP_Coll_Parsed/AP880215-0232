When AnnMargret recently won a Golden Globe 
for her television performance in The Two Mrs Glenvilles she 
experienced a warming wave of nostalgia 
It was just 27 years ago thatthey the Hollywood Foreign Press 
Association gave me the first award I ever received as the most 
promising newcomer of the year she recalled It was in the 
same room International Ballroom Beverly Hilton and I remember 
everything about it including the dress I wore 
In a town where most promising newcomers come and go like the 
Santa Ana winds AnnMargret is a phenomenon After a 
quartercentury she continues high on any producers casting list 
for sexually charged roles At 46 she remains athletically curved 
the emerald eyes smoldering the voice throaty and inviting 
She remains unchanged in other ways as well The deep full 
laugh erupts often more in nervousness than mirth She speaks in 
quiet hesitant sentences recalling the immigrant girl who seemed 
bewildered when Hollywood proclaimed her sexuality in such films as 
Kitten With a Whip and The Pleasure Seekers 
AnnMargret and Roger Smith her husbandmanager for 20 years 
live in the hilltop house overlooking Benedict Canyon it had been 
the honeymoon home of Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart The other 
day in the sunny living room where Bogie once held court the 
actress reminisced about her Hollywood career and talked about two 
forthcoming films A Tigers Tale with C Thomas Howell and 
Charles Durning and A New Life with Alan Alda and Hal Linden 
In A Tigers Tale she plays a character named is Rose Butts 
Howell plays Bubber Drumm 
It takes place in Texas as you might guess she said 
Bubber is one of my daughters boyfriends and Rose tries very 
hard to get away from him But he is so dear and so adorable and 
he really wants to see her They go out a couple of times as 
friends 
But he is so insistent she realizes he really loves her And 
she realizes she loves him Hes very sweet and quite innocent 
In A New Life she and Alda play a couple who have been 
married 26 years They have a 24yearold daughter 
In the very first scene were in the divorce lawyers office 
and hes saying Why are you doing this 
Hes a workaholic AnnMargret said He loves her very 
much but he works five days a week and plays golf with clients on 
Saturday and tennis on Sunday The rest of the film concerns all 
the people he dates and all the people I date There are some very 
odd characters out there 
She was born AnnMargret Ollson in Valsjobyn Sweden in 1941 
and accompanied her parents to the United States at the age of 5 
Her talent developed early and at 16 she appeared on Ted Macks 
Amateur Hour on television After a year at Northwestern 
University she left to tour with other students who formed a music 
group called the Suttletones After a few bookings the group broke 
up and AnnMargret looked for work in Hollywood 
I auditioned for George Burns at his office at General Service 
studio 28 years ago she recalled He still has his office 
there 
We found a piano on one of the stages We took the tarp off 
and my pianist played for me I did a couple of songs and Mr 
Burns asked me if I would be in his show She appeared with Burns 
at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas and Burns pal Jack Benny put her 
on his television show 
Frank Capra chose AnnMargret to play Bette Davis daughter in 
A Pocketful of Miracles and Fox cast her in the remake with 
Rodgers and Hammerstein music of State Fair But it was Bye 
Bye Birdie with Dick Van Dyke that established her as a hot new 
star 
AnnMargret supplied her special brand of sex appeal to such 
leading men as Steve McQueen The Cincinnati Kid Dean Martin 
Murderers Row Anthony Quinn RPM Alain Delon 
Once a Thief and Elvis Presley Viva Las Vegas Not 
until Mike Nichols Carnal Knowledge 1971 did Hollywood 
achkowledge that she could act She won an Academy Award nomination 
as supporting actress a feat she repeated with Tommy in 1975 
In 1967 she married Roger Smith the handsome blond star of the 
77 Sunset Strip TV series of the 50s He abandoned his own 
acting career to become her personal manager guiding her not only 
for films but in her dynamic night club act 
Backstage at a Lake Tahoe casino in 1972 she fell 22 feet from 
a platform to the stage suffering a broken arm five facial 
fractures and a brain concussion Within 10 weeks she was ready to 
star again her Las Vegas act 
The personal appearances ended abruptly in 1983 when Smith was 
stricken with myasthenia gravis a disease of the nerves that 
weakens muscles 
For a long time Roger had no strength couldnt even make a 
fist she said Happily he has been in remission for two years 
now He works out every day in our gym for an hour and a half He 
skis and rides a bike Hes in good shape 
AnnMargret works out daily too and she may one day return to 
the act It all depends on Smith Its very simple hes first
