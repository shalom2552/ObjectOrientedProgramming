Negotiators for Nicaraguan rebels say the 
US refusal of more aid has not changed their position for the 
second round of peace talks Thursday with the Sandinista government 
Fernando Aguero one of the seven Contra delegates told 
reporters after arriving Wednesday that the rebels still want 
threeway talks including the internal Nicaraguan opposition and 
they still want to discuss political matters 
The leftist Nicaraguan government insists on sticking to the 
mechanics of arranging a 30day ceasefire that could lead to a 
permanent truce It says political changes will be discussed only 
after the Contras have accepted an amnesty laid down their arms 
and resumed civilian life within the country 
Aguero the rebel delegate said Our position has not 
changed and it will not change There can be no ceasefire unless 
the Sandinistas first agree to democratic reforms in Nicaragua 
The first direct talks were held in San Jose Costa Rica last 
month a week before the House of Representatives voted down 
President Reagans request for another 362 million in Contra aid 
The rebels and the Nicaraguan government each presented 
radically different proposals in a twoday session that all said 
was noted for cordiality and lack of progress Several diplomatic 
observers suggested neither side wanted to rock the boat before the 
congressional vote 
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo Roman Catholic primate of 
Nicaragua will mediate the Guatemala City talks He was visiting 
Rome on Vatican business during the San Jose session and sent a 
substitute 
Obando y Bravo is scheduled to arrive at midmorning and the 
talks probably will begin in the afternoon at the Guatemala 
archbishopric They are scheduled to end Saturday 
Victor Hugo Tinoco deputy foreign minister will lead the 
Nicaraguan delegation Jaime Morales Carazo a former Managua 
banker heads the Contra group 
The talks are being held in line with a Central American peace 
plan signed last August by by Nicaragua El Salvador Honduras 
Costa Rica and Guatemala
