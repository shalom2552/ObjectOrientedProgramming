The governing Colorado Party called 
for a huge turnout to reelect President Alfredo Stroessner to an 
eighth straight term Opponents labeled the elections a farce and 
urged voters to boycott it 
Despite criticism from the opposition and the Roman Catholic 
Church Stroessner was expected to win Sundays presidential 
elections easily 
The president who has announced no formal platform won 901 
percent of the vote in the last elections in 1983 
Criticism of the 75yearold army general also came from the 
US State Department which said Wednesday in its 1987 human 
rights report that Paraguay has not had a democratic government 
since its independence in 1811 
The report said Stroessner dominates the military the 
political forces the governments bureaucracy and the ruling 
Colorado Party The oppositions ability to conduct an effective 
campaign is severely restricted 
Stroessner son of a Bavarian immigrant father and Paraguayan 
mother has governed since 1954 longer than any other head of 
state in the Western Hemisphere 
He faces nominal opposition from candidates of two small 
recognized parties There are 144 million registered voters out 
of a population of 37 million 
The other candidates are Rep Carlos Ferreira Ibarra 54 of the 
Liberal Party and Sen Luis Maria Vega 65 of the Radical Liberal 
Party Both men accused by other opposition groups of being 
government accomplices admit publicly they cannot win 
Current conditions do not guarantee free elections Ferreira 
said 
Three opposition groups charged that at least 12 of their 
members were arrested Thursday for taking part in political acts 
Police released most of them Friday without explanation 
Police late Friday left the Asuncion home of Domingo Laino 
president of the unrecognized Authentic Radical Liberal Party and 
Paraguays leading opposition spokesman For two days they had 
prevented people from entering or leaving the home Lainos 
telephone line remained cut 
The elections also include races for the 72 seats in the House 
of Deputies and 36 seats in the Senate The party winning the 
largest percentage of votes gets twothirds of the seats in 
Congress The rest are divided according to the percentage won by 
other parties 
The Colorado Party is expected to win the majority of 
congressional seats Stroessner closed his campaign Thursday night 
with a 40minute nationally televised address to 151000 supporters 
by party count in Asuncion 
Wearing the partys traditional crimson kerchief around his 
neck Stroessner recounted his governments achievements in health 
education and public welfare and promised to pay off Paraguays 
23 billion foreign debt one of Latin Americas smallest 
Interrupted a dozen times by chants and cheers in Spanish and 
Guarani the Indian language spoken by most Paraguayans Stroessner 
vowed his government will not share power with minorities who 
call themselves defenders of human rights and embrace the evil and 
bloody servants of international communism 
Voter polls conducted late last month by the independent 
Asuncion newspaper Ultima Hora indicate many voters do not even 
know the names of Stroessners opponents who together spent less 
than 100000 on their campaign 
A third officially recognized party the Febrerista 
Revolutionary Party has refused to take part in elections since 
1973 saying the voting is rigged 
The main opposition is from the National Accord a loose 
grouping of the Febreristas and three parties not officially 
recognized the Authentic Radical Liberals the Colorado Popular 
Movement and the Christian Democrats 
The National Accord asked voters to boycott Sundays ballot 
Election rules require all citizens aged 18 to 60 to vote The 
government said fines and other penalties for failure to vote will 
be enforced 
Other critics include members of the Colorado Partys 
traditional wing ousted from party leadership by a militant 
proStroessner faction at the August party convention The wing 
recommend voters cast blank ballots as a show of disapproval 
The archbishop of Asuncion Ismael Rolon recently told the 
countrys overwhelmingly Catholic population it was their duty to 
vote for the candidate of your choice and if none meets your 
expectations then you are free to cast a blank vote 
Blank votes are permitted by law but in past elections have 
been included among the uncounted with nullified or spoiled votes 
The Colorado Party called Friday for voters to prove their 
allegiance to Stroessner with a massive turnout Sunday 
The elections will be observed by official and unofficial 
representatives invited by both the government and the opposition 
including observers from the United States and the European 
Parliament
