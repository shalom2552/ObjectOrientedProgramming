This is where they teach elephants to 
do tricks 
In six months to a year the Way Kambas Elephant School can 
teach an elephant to salute sit on concrete bench lift things 
pull cars climb steps kick a ball step over a prostrated person 
and play soccer 
This year 25 of the schools best soccer players were selected 
from a group of 42 to play Feb 8 at Bandar Lampung as a highlight 
at a national Koranreading contest The Koran is the Moslems holy 
book 
The players received three months intensive training on how to 
play good clean soccer because even in elephant soccer which has 
become popular in some areas of Southeast Asia a player can be 
penalized 
After graduating from the school the elephants are auctioned 
off with a knockdown price of 5992 to perform in circuses or 
other events 
Most of the elephants enrolled in the school come from the thick 
tropical jungles here on the island of Sumatra 
They are rounded up with the help of experienced trainers from 
Thailand called Mahout The Mahouts have brought several 
seasoned elephants from Thailand called kunce to help lure 
prospective students to a secluded spot where they are narcotized 
with dartguns 
Then the sedated elephants are loaded onto trucks and brought to 
the school at Lampung 
The idea of teaching wild elephants to do tricks arose after the 
government decided against trying to decrease Sumatras elephant 
population to keep them from damaging farm crops 
Thus with the help of the government of Thailand the school 
was established in the Way Kambas district of south Sumatra in 
August 1985 
The school covers an area of 1235 acres and has a staff of 10 
including five Thai Mahouts 
An increasing human population on Sumatra and uncontrolled 
slashandburn farming methods have resulted in a scarcity of food 
for wild elephants leaving them to forage on farms 
The province of Lampung alone has about 500 wild elephants 
whose number grows at a rate of about 20 a year 
The Indonesian government has launched several campaigns to move 
the elephants to conservation areas The biggest conservation 
campaign started in 1982 has succeeded in moving 230 wild 
elephants into a conservation area in central Sumatra
