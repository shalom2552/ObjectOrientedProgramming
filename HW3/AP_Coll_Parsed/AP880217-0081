The Metro Council has killed a bill to 
ban sex in cityowned or operated buildings rejecting a 
councilmans argument that the measure was needed to stop 
harassment of female workers 
There are already laws that take care of this matter said 
Councilman Tom Sharp who moved to table the bill Tuesday night 
The council killed the bill by voice vote on first reading 
before it could be considered by a council committee 
George Darden the measures sponsor said he was disappointed 
I thought the council would give me the courtesy to pass my 
bill onto second reading and I could refer it to the attorney 
general for a ruling to see if it did have merit to it 
Ive got many people in my area who complain of harassment on 
the job he said They say they cant be promoted without being 
available to the boss man 
Darden said he would look for some other way to address the 
problem
