The Guardian liberalIf you are counting the odds at this 
stage you may still feel Bob Dole a good bet for the Republican 
nomination but the prospect of a hung Democratic convention and a 
good deal of brokering around the third ballot grows rather closer 
together with the familiar prospect of a major opposition party so 
exhausted by fighting internally that it forgets that the point of 
the process doesnt come until November

Vittorio Zucconi commenting La Repubblica of Rome 
leftleaning The state of Massachusetts which about 28 years 
ago proposed to America the first Catholic president in its 
history is putting another challenge before the nation the first 
candidate with a foreign name The year 1988 which could have 
been the year of the ItaloAmerican Mario Cuomo is becoming the 
year of the GreekAmerican Michael Dukakis The human comedy 
of the campaign has found a new protagonist in the 50yearold

The Australian independent national It now seems that the 
Republican nominee will be either Mr Bush or Sen Dole The 
vicepresident has made a remarkable recovery but he also won New 
Hampshire in 1980 over Mr Reagan who went on to win finally in a 
sweeping victory 
Gov Dukakis won little more than onethird of the votes 
in a state that borders his own Massachusetts This must mean that 
the outcome of the Democratic contest is still wide open even 
though some of the early starters will not remain to the end and 
the possibility that the Democratic Party will draft Gov Mario 
Cuomo of New York cannot be put out of the question 
Sydney Morning Herald independent Bushs victory alone is 
unlikely to arrest the momentum of his leading rival Sen Bob 
Dole Nor will it have discouraged Southern supporters of the Rev 
Pat Robertson who in the wake of Iowa threatens the Republican 
Party establishment 
In the Democratic primary Gov Michael Dukakis emerged as a 
clear winner as expected At this stage however his victory falls 
short of the conclusive kind of result which New Hampshire has 
produced for the Democrats in the past 
Australian Financial Review Sen Bob Dole lost New Hampshire 
and perhaps let the presidency of the United States slip through 
his fingers because of a catastrophic tactical blunder 
He let Bush tag him as soft on tax rises in a low tax state 
It saved his Bushs political life and reestablished his claim as 
Republican front runner and favorite for the nomination

Berlinske Tidende of Copenhagen conservative Now that both 
Bush and Dole have shown what theyre good for they can go forward 
to prepare for a string of primaries on March 8 Super Tuesday 
And they can both be quite certain that it will be one or the other 
of them who will run against a Democratic candidate in November

Arbeiderbladet of Oslo Labor Party Vice President George 
Bush averted disaster in New Hampshire but the victory there does 
not mean that he can feel sure that he will be nominated Senator 
Robert Dole can still win nomination by winning the primaries in 
the southern states next month 
Aftenposten of Oslo conservative Democrat Michael Dukakis 
has a good platform after winning in New Hampshire Dukakis can 
be a strong challenger to Bush because he stands in the midst 
of the mainstream of American politics

Mainichi Daily News independent Englishlanguage During 
this voting in 20 states will economic criticisms of Japan and 
economic nationalism appear full blown in the efforts to gain 
votes If the Japan problem is taken up as a campaign issue to an 
unnecessary extent or in a mistaken manner this may even affect 
JapanAmerican political and economic relations 
At a time when the United States is suffering from huge trade 
and fiscal deficits to a greater extent than ever before we would 
like to have the various presidential candidates carry out calm and 
conscientious policies visavis Japan
