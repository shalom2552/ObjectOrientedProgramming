A research satellite launched last week to 
test elements of the proposed Star Wars antimissile shield 
failed in a secondary tracking excercise when an optical sensor 
gave false data to two onboard computers an Air Force official 
said Friday 
Air Force Col John Otten assistant director of the Strategic 
Defense Initiatives kinetic energy office said an optical sensor 
on Delta 181 a satellite used to test Star Wars sensors and 
trackers gave flawed data when it tried to track target objects 
that were beyond its range 
Otten said the sensor data went into the computers causing them 
to respond inappropriately He said the flaw was detected within an 
hour and the computers were told to ignore the data This corrected 
the problem 
Some of the test data on the system was lost because of the 
problem but Otten said the loss was minor because the tracking 
exercise was a secondary objective In the fundamental mission we 
suceeded he said 
Delta 181 was launched Feb 8 from the Kennedy Space Center and 
spent 12 hours conducting a series of tests to gather data needed 
to refine the SDI or Star Wars antimissile system 
Program manager Andy Green last week called the flight a very 
successful mission 
However Aviation Week and Space Technology in a story prepared 
for Monday publication said the satellite was unable to complete 
battle management fire control computations 
The magazine blamed the problem on the computers but Otten said 
the flaw actually was caused by the optical sensor attempting to 
lock onto an object beyond its range 
Sensors on the satellite were used to track 14 subsatellite 
targets released in two groups from the Delta 
Otten said the problem developed when the optical sensor located 
an object looked away and then tried to relocate the original 
object By then the target had moved beyond the range of the 
sensor 
The tracking test using the optical sensor was halted when the 
fuel budgeted for that exercise became exhausted Otten said 
He said an infrared sensor also failed to function properly but 
infrared data was collected by a backup system 
Otten said only about three percent of the data collected during 
the 12hour mission of Delta 181 has been examined
