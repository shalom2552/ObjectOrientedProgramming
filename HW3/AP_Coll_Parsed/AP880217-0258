A company accused along with the Hunt brothers of 
cornering the silver market in 1980 agreed to pay a Peruvian 
company 365 million in an outofcourt settlement a Minpeco SA 
attorney said 
AML Futures is the last of six financial institutions accused by 
Minpeco of participating in an illegal price manipulation scheme 
that drove up silver prices that led to substantial losses for the 
company owned by the government of Peru 
The Hunts claim they did nothing illegal when they began pouring 
money into the silver market From August 1979 to March 1980 the 
price of silver rose from 9 an ounce to 50 an ounce before the 
market collapsed to about 10 an ounce 
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Thursday in the trial 
against the Hunts Nelson Bunker William Herbert and Lamar 
before US Federal District Judge Morris E Lasker in New York 
City Opening arguments in the case are scheduled for Wednesday 
Feb 24 
The AML Futures settlement and those by the other institutions 
add up to 6465 million said Mark A Cymrot of Cole amp Corrette 
the Washington DC firm that represents Minpeco 
Minpeco Perus largest precious metals distributor seeks to 
recover 150 million in damages 
In addition to AML Futures EF Hutton amp Co now part of 
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc Merrill Lynch PrudentialBache 
Securities Inc Continental Grain Cos ContiCommodity Services 
unit and Banque Populaire Suisse have reached outofcourt 
agreements with Minpeco since 1986 
The original damage claim was for 225 million to 252 million 
that Minpeco said it lost in trading losses and potential profits 
because of silver market manipulations in late 1979 and early 1980 
by the Hunt brothers 
On Dec 22 Lasker ruled that Minpeco must subtract from its 
damage claim profits made when silver bullion prices skyrocketed 
and could not sue for lost potential profits These rulings reduced 
the amount of the claim to 150 million 
The Hunts also are facing two class action suits by more than 
17000 silver futures investors who claim that illegal market 
manipulation caused them losses
