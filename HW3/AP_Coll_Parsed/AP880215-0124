Opening of negotiations and relative 
quiet on the warfront have sparked a glimmer of hope that two 
decades of savage conflict in Cambodia can be solved through 
political compromise rather than more bloodshed 
After an 8yearlong stalemate two rounds of peace talks were 
recently held between key protagonists Cambodian resistance leader 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Prime Minister Hun Sen of the proHanoi 
regime in Cambodia 
Vietnam which invaded Cambodia in 1978 now says that if an 
acceptable political solution is reached it may withdraw its 
troops before an announced 1990 pullout And Moscow has indicated 
it wants to heal itself of two festering Asian sores Cambodia and 
Afghanistan 
Although negotiations in Paris last December and January did not 
produce a mutually acceptable blueprint for peace both sides say 
they are working toward freedom from outside interference and an 
end to Cambodias cycle of agony Since 1970 Cambodia has suffered 
a devastating fiveyear war a reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge 
the Vietnamese invasion and a continuing guerrilla war Millions 
have perished 
Deep suspicions of Vietnams motives remain as do fears of a 
return to power of the brutal Khmer Rouge And analysts are puzzled 
by the moves of the unpredictable prince who on Jan 30 resigned 
as head of a threeparty resistance coalition and who regularly 
lashes out at his partnersinwar 
The 65yearold Sihanouk onetime king consummate survivor 
enduringly popular leader headed a coalition of the communist 
Khmer Rouge the Khmer Peoples National Liberation Front and his 
own followers fighting the Vietnamese China arms the coalition 
The Soviet Union fuels Vietnams war machine 
Stressing that Vietnam was eager to attract investment from the 
West Hanoi adviser Nguyen Xuan Oanh admitted recently the war in 
Cambodia was a very costly proposition It has drained our 
resources Besides the burden of keeping about 140000 troops in 
Cambodia the opportunity costs are great most nonSoviet bloc 
nations continue to shun Vietnam insisting on a troop withdrawal 
before engaging in full trade and aid relations with Hanoi 
Also widely seen as helping the process of political settlement 
are the rise of seemingly more flexible leaders Mikhail Gorbachev 
in Moscow Deng Xiaopings followers in Peking and Vietnamese 
Communist Party chief Nguyen van Linh in Hanoi China cites the 
Vietnamese grip on Cambodia as a key barrier to detente with 
Moscow which appears to be seeking closer ties with Peking 
Changes are also perceived in the military situation I cant 
tell you who is winning the war in Cambodia but presently both 
sides are turning to political means instead of fighting on the 
battlefield says Lt Gen Sihadaj Bunnag spokesman of 
Thailands military command 
Several Western analysts interviewed agree that in recent months 
fighting has decreased substantially although reasons given for 
this are largely speculative 
Rather than seeking combat one theory says the resistance 
guerrillas are concentrating on grassroots organization and 
propaganda trying to solidify support for their respective groups 
in event action shifts to the political arena 
Militarily the balance appears to be unchanged from recent 
years the estimated 50000strong fighters of the coalition cant 
defeat the Vietnamese but would probably rout the weak proHanoi 
Cambodian army if Hanoi pulled out The Khmer Rouge remains the 
most powerful military force within the coalition 
For many Western and Thai analysts a worst case scenario 
would be Vietnamese entrenchment in Cambodia continued warfare 
the indefinite existence of 250000 Cambodian refugees along the 
ThaiCambodian border 
Perhaps the most optimistic future envisioned by Western 
observers is a Vietnamese pullout a coalition government in 
Cambodia with Sihanouk as a major figure and a withering away of 
the Khmer Rouge through defections of younger conscripts and 
general hatred of a force robbed of its major appeal fighting a 
foreign invader 
Sihanouk himself outlines a quadripartite provisional 
government including the three coalition members and the Hun Sen 
side This foursome would work on organizing general elections 
under international supervision and be backed by a fourparty 
national army 
Sihanouk appears to be key to the question of peace or war in 
Cambodia He still enjoys widespread domestic popularity and by far 
the greatest backing internationally among the coalitions leaders 
His latest maneuvers may be designed to get the fractious coalition 
solidly behind his negotiation efforts 
Since his resignation the two coalition partners have come 
begging for his return China although the staunchest backer of 
the Khmer Rouge stressed its support Communist Party chief Zhao 
Ziyang praised Sihanouk as a great patriot and experienced 
politician Should the coalition sides ever compete for power in 
Phnom Penh Sihanouk would need Pekings help in curbing the Khmer 
Rouge
