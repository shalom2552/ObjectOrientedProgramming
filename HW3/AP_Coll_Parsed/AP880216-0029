As a political science major Greg Lunn 
knew the job description including the fine print Still he never 
thought it would come to this 
It is most definitely not the sort of task I had in mind when 
I ran for office he said the other day reflecting on what has 
become Topic A across Arizona among residents and visitors alike 
the impeachment of the governor 
And Im sure he said that I speak for my colleagues of 
both parties 
Lunn is one of the 30 Arizona state senators who soon sitting 
as a jury will decide whether to restore Evan Mecham to office 
Mecham is now in political limbo impeached by the House of 
Representatives 4614 and his gubernatorial duties assumed by the 
secretary of state 
The next step is a trial in the state Senate where a conviction 
would require a twothirds vote The trial is scheduled to start 
Feb 22 
Judging the fitness of a governor to remain in office seems to 
be like cleaning the gutters No matter how ardent the outcry that 
it be done there is no joy in doing it 
Stop any senator in the Capitol corridors these days and you 
hear phrases like awesome responsibility and nowin 
situation 
Mecham a Republican won the office with less than 40 percent 
of a light turnout in a threeway election It is safe to say 
says Lunn also a Republican that to the vast majority of 
Arizonans he is the worst governor this state has ever seen 
He has polarized the state Instead of practicing the art of 
the possible the art of compromise of bringing people together 
he has brought a narrow ideological and personal agenda and is 
trying to shove it down peoples throats Anyone who opposes him on 
any basis instantly becomes an enemy 
Even so says Lunn to invalidate a constitutionally held 
election is the most sobering act any of us could ever 
contemplate 
Lunn 35 has made politics a career Unlike nearly all other 
members of the Legislature he has no other job He makes no bones 
about planning to run for governor himself some day 
He represents Tucson one of the states two urban centers 
where his constituents are about evenly divided between Democrats 
and Republicans 
However I vote in the impeachment trial yea or nay and I 
wont make up my mind until its time I will not please many of 
my constituents This is true of all of us to a greater or lesser 
degree depending on the makeup of the constituency 
But thats good It will make it easier for us to put aside 
any public or political pressures and make our decision solely on 
the facts as we see them 
Another senator Carol Macdonald feels equally free of 
political pressure but for exactly opposite reasons 
She represents one of the most remote areas in the state Her 
home is Safford a town of 8000 the largest in the three counties 
she represents She is part owner of the town drug store and served 
as mayor without any party affiliation When the Republican senator 
who represented the district for 30 years retired last year her 
neighbors voted for her to take his place She did as a Republican 
She says her constituents are predominately Mormons She is not 
Mormons who number about 200000 in Arizona are divided on the 
Mecham issue but nonetheless represent a great deal of his support 
I came here to represent rural people who dont have a lot of 
representation in an urbandominated Legislature she said but 
I have absolutely no political ambitions beyond doing that duty as 
best I can 
So I feel comfortable about casting a vote because I feel I 
can make a fair decision If it happens that my constituents dont 
like it and dont choose to send me back so be it 
Lunn for his part expects the vote to be close 
Mecham he points out faces a criminal trial for not reporting 
a campaign loan as well as a May 17 recall election resulting from 
a public petition 
Even if some senators feel he is guilty of an impeachable 
offense they could vote against it as an attack on the fairness of 
the process Why not use one of these other avenues 
Well why not 
Because the people have a right to expect a standard of 
behavior in their public officials that does not have as its bottom 
line simply acting lawfully 
Thats why the constitution provides for impeachment It is a 
political process not a judicial one A court trial could be long 
and drawn out if there is a conviction there would be appeals 
There is no shortterm way that these matters can be resolved 
but they must be resolved so we can restore some stability to this 
state 
Thats why Im prepared to do a duty that is extremely onerous 
to do
