A former Liggett amp Myers president ignored 
the issue of smoking and health until the 1964 Surgeon Generals 
report and asserted that smoking posed no hazard because it never 
harmed him according to evidence released Wednesday 
Milton E Harrington said in testimony read for the jury that 
company officials didnt even discuss a position about smoking 
and health as far as the corporation was concerned 
Previous testimony in the trial in which Liggett and two other 
cigarette makers are being sued over a smokers lungcancer death 
revealed that Liggett had a 25year research program starting in 
1954 to develop a less carcinogenic cigarette that was never 
marketed 
Harrington under questioning by plaintiffs attorney Marc Z 
Edell said the 1964 report was a concern to us as it was to 
other people in the industry 
But Harrington said I didnt think anything about smoking and 
health other than smoking was not harmful to you in any way 
Edell asked the basis for that opinion and Harrington replied 
It didnt ever harm me 
Edell pressed him for the facts he considered and Harrington 
said it was just my belief 
Once the Surgeon Generals report came out Harrington said he 
didnt look further into the validity of its findings because it 
wouldnt do any good anyway 
He said he read it as executive vice president shortly before 
becoming president 
Edell asked Harrington about the adequacy of federally mandated 
warnings on cigarette packs required in 1966 
We didnt care to warn the public about anything We just had 
to put that warning on It wasnt because we liked to It was just 
something we had to do We werent interested in warning the public 
about something Harrington replied 
Harrington who has since died was 76 when the testimony was 
taken by attorneys for Antonio Cipollone 64 of Lakehurst NJ 
who is suing Liggett Group Inc Philip Morris Co and Lorillard 
Inc for the death of his wife Rose Liggett Group is the parent 
company of Liggett amp Myers 
It was read in court Wednesday by Edell and an actor playing the 
role of Harrington The executive was a former semiprofessional 
baseball player who joined the company in 1934 and rose through the 
ranks until becoming president and chief operating officer in 1964 
He retired in 1972 
Responding to Harringtons statements Liggett spokesman Alan 
Hilburg said the witness was nearly 80 years old when he gave 
that testimony 
It wasnt unusual for peoples memories to fade over that 
period of time Hilburg said He said he did not know when 
Harrington died 
Cipollone charges that the three tobacco companies makers of 
the brands Mrs Cipollone smoked neglected to do enough research 
on cigarettes didnt reveal adequately what they did find and 
failed to put safer cigarettes on the market 
One reason for not marketing the safer cigarette Edell argues 
was because to do so would weaken the companies defense against 
lawsuits over their existing products 
Referring to a 1968 memorandum from Liggetts researcher to 
Harrington on a meeting of tobacco company scientific directors 
Edell asked what Harrington did with similar memos after reading 
them 
I read that and probably referred it to our legal 
department the former executive replied 
Why asked Edell 
Because I thought they should know about it Harrington 
replied 
Why Edell pursued 
That was just our policy They were the people that I was 
holding responsible 
The purpose of the conference detailed in the memo was to 
discuss the scientific aspects of the problems facing the tobacco 
industry with specific emphasis on tobacco and health the 
document said
