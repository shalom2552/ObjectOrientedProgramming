President Kurt Waldheim rejected the 
slanders hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations of 
those who want him to resign and urged the nation Monday to unite 
behind him 
His televised speech appeared certain to deepen divisions caused 
by the report of an international panel of historians last week It 
questioned the presidents moral integrity and said he was in 
close proximity to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did 
nothing to stop them 
On Monday Waldheim claimed without giving specifics that 
parts of the report do not correspond to the facts but are built 
on presumptions and hypotheses For that reason the conclusions 
drawn cannot be upheld 
Waldheim 69 used highly emotional language in appeals both to 
World War II compatriots and those too young to know the horrors 
of this war 
He said he might have erred in not discussing his wartime past 
but said he never tried to conceal it I have a clear 
conscience the former UN secretarygeneral told Austrias 75 
million citizens 
In their 202page report the historians concluded that Waldheim 
tried to cover up his service as a German army lieutenant in the 
Balkans The government appointed the panel at Waldheims request 
in September after the United States put him on a watch list 
of undesirable aliens 
In an interview broadcast Monday on ABCs World News Tonight 
Waldheim appealed to the American public for understanding 
If I have misled my friends in the United States because I 
didnt say anything as far as my military career is concerned I am 
sorry It was not done purposely Believe me And I hope this 
will be understood because I have so many friends in the United 
States And I hope they will believe me that I havent done 
anything wrong 
Waldheim also said that resigning would be against the wishes of 
those who elected him 
Do you really think that a clear decision by the Austrian 
people on the presidency who should be president should be 
corrected Accusations which are completely wrong which have no 
foundation Why should then the president resign leaving the 
country in disaster he said 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said in a televised interview Sunday 
which was praised even by conservative critics that Waldheim did 
not deal exactly with the truth and must restore his credibility 
Vranitzky said he would consider resigning if the conflict over 
Waldheim continued occupying time the government should devote to 
other matters The Socialist chancellor leads a coalition with the 
conservative Peoples Party which supported Waldheim for election 
in 1986 
Socialist Party secretary Heinrich Keller said after the 
14minute speech Monday it was a great disappointment and means 
Waldheim will continue to be an unbelievable burden for our 
country 
A petition drive for Waldheims resignation has obtained more 
than 2000 signatures including those of most leading 
intellectuals according to an employee of the news magazine 
Profil It printed the first 1496 signatures on three pages Monday 
About 5000 opponents of Waldheim demonstrated in downtown 
Vienna on Sunday and about half marched to his office in the 
Hofburg palace calling for his resignation 
The president has consistently denied wrongdoing since Austrian 
and US media first disclosed his Balkans service in March 1986 
during the presidential election campaign As the controversy 
continued he has refused all demands that he resign 
Waldheim reiterated his stand on Monday arguing that 
resignation would undo a decision fundamental to Austrias 
democracy 
In the course of the renewed discussion the question was also 
put about my premature departure from the office of federal 
president he said I want to take a stand in all clarity You 
my dear Austrians have elected me federal president with a 
convincing majority in a secret and direct election for six years 
Thus it is no longer a matter of the man Kurt Waldheim he 
said In view of the slanders I have often asked myself in the 
last two years whether I should carry on 
It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that an 
election result cannot be subsequently corrected Waldheim said 
A head of state must not retreat in the face of slanders hateful 
demonstrations and wholesale condemnations 
In a runoff election in June 1986 Waldheim won with 536 
percent of the vote 
Hans Rudolf Kurz the Swiss chairman of the historians 
commission said in a magazine interview published Monday he thinks 
Waldheim would do Austria a service by resigning 
Alois Mock deputy chancellor of Austria and head of the 
Peoples Party reiterated his support for Waldheim but Economics 
Minister Robert Graf another leading conservative expressed 
impatience 
Graf said Waldheim must take a decision which is very 
important for our country 
In a radio interview several hours before the president spoke 
Graf said he was concerned about Austrias tainted image and 
praised the comments Vranitzky made Sunday 
Conservative commentators who once stood solidly behind the 
president also were complimentary about the chancellor 
In an apparent reference to Vranitzky Waldheim asked political 
leaders Monday not to pour oil on the fire of debate 
He said the debate abroad would abate if the polemics stop 
inside Austria itself 
To my dear countrymen he said 
You can trust me as you trusted me two years ago when you 
elected me Those people who spread intolerance and discord 
cannot be allowed to prevail but rather the great majority of 
those for whom it is a question of our homeland of our common 
Austria 
If we want this we will do it together and can form the 
future with new strength
