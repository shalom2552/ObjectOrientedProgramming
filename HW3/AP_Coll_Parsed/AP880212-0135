An agreement has been reached between union 
construction crews and Amoco Corp ending a fourmonth labor 
dispute at the Whiting Ind refinery 
A union official said Thursday the Chicagobased oil company had 
agreed to use only union contractors In return the unions agreed 
to call off picketing and a campaign calling for a union consumer 
boycott of Amocos gas stations 
G Russell Bassett president of the Northwest Indiana Building 
and Construction Trades Council said the Chicagobased oil company 
agreed to use only union contractors for any refinery construction 
work in the future 
The dispute began in October when Amoco hired nonunion 
contractors for 10 million worth of construction and renovation 
work at the 99yearold refinery The work was completed recently 
despite the presence of union picket lines 
More than 55 people were arrested and several were injured 
during the first days of the picketing which drew as many as 1000 
union members 
In a move to put economic pressure on Amoco the unions withdrew 
at least 100 million in funds from Chicago banks that had Amoco 
executives on their boards of directors Bassett said redepositing 
of that money was not part of the settlement worked out with the 
company 
Resolution of the dispute came several days after members of the 
Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers Union endorsed a twoyear contract 
covering the Whiting refinery and other Amoco installations around 
the country 
All parties are gratified with the settlement and are looking 
forward to a resumption of work Amoco said in a statement 
Thursday
