Inspectors for the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration could shut down unsafe plants and 
construction sites under a major overhaul of the nations primary 
job safety law advocated by the AFLCIO 
Although no such legislation is under consideration now the 
executive council of the 143million member labor federation said 
Monday it wants Congress to change the 17yearold OSHA law once a 
new president is elected 
The acts penalty structure and criminal provisions must be 
strengthened the 36member council of union leaders said in a 
statement Those provisions are badly out of date and fall far 
short of those provided in more recent safety and health laws such 
as the Mine Safety and Health Act 
Inspectors for OSHAs sister agency the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration now have the authority to shut down any unsafe mine 
on the spot OSHA inspectors lack that power except in rare 
circumstances and even then they must first obtain a court order 
The AFLCIO measure also would expand coverage under the OSHA 
law to include workers in the nuclear and transportation industries 
and some 14 million employees of state and local governments All 
of them are exempt now 
In addition it would mandate safety and health committees with 
union or other worker representation at each job site 
The committees would have the right to conduct their own 
inspections review an employers hazard control measures and 
direct a shutdown of a dangerous job site on their own said 
Margaret Seminario the federations deputy director for safety and 
health 
The initial reaction by Labor Department officials attending the 
AFLCIOs annual winter meeting here was positive 
But Assistant Labor Secretary David Demarest said any 
consideration of amending the law would first require a major 
policy review within the department That kind of action is not 
even in the planning during the last year of President Reagans 
administration he said 
Business groups also want the law changed but in a different 
way The US Chamber of Commerce has called for legislation that 
would mandate costbenefit analyses now being practiced as policy 
under by adminstration before OSHA can issue new or toughen 
existing health and safety regulations 
The chamber also wants to prohibit OSHA from interference in 
issues that it says more appropriately belong under the 
jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board such as 
responding to every worker complaint with a plant inspection as 
now required by the law 
In the past year unions have helped workers file complaints of 
unsafe conditions with OSHA that have resulted in fines ranging up 
to more than 25 million against companies such as IBP Corp the 
nations largest meatpacker and International Paper Co
