A federal appeals court Tuesday revived a 
lawsuit challenging the expansion of hunting on federal wildlife 
preserves when it ruled the Humane Society had legal standing to 
bring the case 
A threejudge panel of the US Circuit Court of Appeals here 
overturned a district judges finding that the Humane Society of 
the United States lacked the requisite legal standing to sue the 
Interior Department to stop hunting on nine federal wildlife 
preserves 
The gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting on 
wildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpses 
and environmental degradation in addition to depleting the supply 
of animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view the court 
said in an opinion written by Judge Patricia Wald chief judge 
These are classic aesthetic interests which have always 
enjoyed protection under standing analysis Wald wrote 
David J Hayes a Washington attorney who represented the Humane 
Society called the decision significant because it confirms that 
environmental groups like the Humane Society have the right to 
bring actions based on their members concerns about harms to their 
aesthetic interests 
An appellate decision upholding the dismissal of the lawsuit by 
US District Judge Thomas A Flannery would have made it 
difficult for any wildlife group to bring suit for the protection 
of wildlife Hayes said 
While ruling the society had a legal right to sue the court 
upheld the Interior Departments decision to allow waterfowl 
hunting on Chincoteague Island Va 
The appeals court sent the case back to Flannery to rule on the 
merits of the Humane Societys claims that the Interior Department 
had not properly evaluated the wildlife populations of other 
preserves before allowing hunting 
James Goodrich executive vice president of the Wildlife 
Legislative Fund of America Inc a hunters group said he was 
disappointed by the courts decision But he predicted that hunting 
would be upheld at the other preserves 
On a single refuge the appeals court said that everything was 
proper in permitting hunting Assumedly that would apply to all 
other refuges Goodrich said
