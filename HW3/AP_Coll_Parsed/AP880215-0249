The past year was a good one for the beef 
cattle industry and 1988 will bring renewed efforts to export its 
products the president of the National Cattlemens Association 
said Monday 
From a cattlemans viewpoint beef prices are going to be very 
good NCA President Jack Dahl told reporters at the associations 
annual convention Aggressive promotional campaigns and stronger 
demand will reduce the amount of beef in the market resulting in 
better prices Dahl said 
Because of health concerns the industry has in past years 
experienced overproduction and lower sales with American consumers 
buying more poultry pork and other products 
Some experts say there is little evidence to suggest a 
strengthening in demand for meat products in domestic markets 
The NCA is working hard in Congress and with foreign governments 
to lower or eliminate tariffs and embargoes on American beef Dahl 
said 
We must promote and advertise beef to improve demand but that 
will do us little good if we are legislated or regulated out of 
business he said in a report to nearly 5000 cattlemen and 
family members attending the convention and trade show in Orlando 
Alan R Middaugh president of the US Meat Export Federation 
said a 21 percent increase in Japans beef quota last year plus 
projected increases through the end of the century demonstrate the 
benefits of developing foreign markets 
The Japanese government responded to high consumer demand by 
hiking the import quota in August by 37000 metric tons Middaugh 
said 
In the first 11 months of 1987 American beef and veal exports 
worldwide totaled 192731 metric tons valued at 7038 million 
This was a 22 percent increase in tonnage and a 26 percent increase 
in dollar value over the previous year Middaugh said 
Of the 1987 totals 116668 metric tons or 5115 million went 
to Japan he said That represented a 13 percent increase in 
tonnage and 17 percent increase in dollar value over the previous 
year 
Dahl said NCA strongly supports the US governments 
position to abolish quotas But other changes need to be made in 
the distribution of beef in Japan We know that the Japanese 
have a great liking for beef
