Black Hispanic American Indian and Asian 
students occupying a University of Massachusetts building for the 
third day said Sunday a church had pledged money and restaurants 
had donated hot meals 
We havent even had to leave the building to buy food said 
Rio Gabriel 21 a junior from Toronto 
The estimated 125 demonstrators have held the New Africa Hall on 
the UMass campus since Friday to protest an attack on two black 
students allegedly beaten by whites and other recent incidents at 
the school 
Protesters allowed reporters into a small room on the ground 
floor of the hall to answer questions The building showed no signs 
of occupation such as banners and pickets and there were no 
police officers outside 
Protesters said they would occupy the fourstory brick building 
until Chancellor Joseph D Duffey met demands including the 
suspension of five white students accused of the Feb 7 beatings 
The third day of the takeover began with a worship service led 
by the Rev Gary Jenkins of Hartford 
A lot of people here are religious and did make a commitment 
to stay here until this is resolved said Roscoe Robinson 24 a 
senior from Boston Along with sleeping accommodations and food 
there are religious needs we have to take care of 
Other demonstrators left briefly for showers and breakfast at 
home Ms Gabriel said 
Group leaders talked with black administrators Sunday in 
preparation for a meeting with the chancellor on their demands 
which were being revised to include more funds for minority 
activities and increased hiring of minority faculty she said 
Only 41 of the 1339 faculty members and 5 percent of the 20000 
undergraduates are black mirroring a nationwide decline in the 
number of black applicants in the last several years according to 
the school 
Blacks at the university say an undercurrent of racism has not 
abated since October 1986 when blacks and whites clashed following 
the Boston Red Sox loss to the New York Mets in the final game of 
the World Series Six white students eventually pleaded no contest 
to varying charges 
Duffey has acknowledged that racism continues to be a problem at 
the school I think weve got a continuing problem with 
harassment and abuse the chancellor said 
Duffey was trying to avoid a confrontation with protesters when 
school resumes Tuesday university spokesman James Langley said 
Were being as patient as we possibly can Langley said I 
dont think youll see any arrests They are being very peaceful 
This is not a mob said Roberto Christian 26 a graduate 
student from Mayaguez Puerto Rico 
Hostility breeds hostility Robinson said Were almost in 
the 1990s and racial hostility is still happening Im sick of it 
Protesters have received 575 from students and faculty members 
a pledge for 5000 from the Convent Avenue Baptist Church of New 
York City food from Amherst restaurants and blankets sleeping 
bags and pillows Ms Gabriel said 
A spokeswoman for the Convent Avenue church who asked that her 
name not be used confirmed that the church had offered support 
including financial aid but declined to confirm the 5000 figure
