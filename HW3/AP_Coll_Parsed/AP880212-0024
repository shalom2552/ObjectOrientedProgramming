Nuclear testban negotiations resuming next 
week in Geneva are making progress toward means of verifying two 
unratified test ban treaties the White House said Friday 
In a statement spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the talks which 
begin again Monday represent a practical approach as the 
president has long advocated to nuclear testing limitations which 
are in our national security interest 
Fitzwater said the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in 
undertaking the talks that the first step should be to negotiate 
effective verification measures for the Threshold Test Ban Treaty 
and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty 
The two pacts limiting the magnitude of certain nuclear tests 
were negotiated in the 1970s but ratification has been withheld 
because of concerns about how Soviet compliance could be verified 
Once our verification concerns have been satisfied and the 
treaties ratified we will propose that the United States and the 
Soviet Union immediately enter into negotiations on ways to 
implement a stepbystep program in association with a program to 
reduce and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons of limiting and 
ultimately ending nuclear testing the spokesman said 
We are making progress toward our goal of effective 
verification he added 
With a better understanding of the practical problems 
associated with conducting these experiments we now have the 
information needed to design the experiments Fitzwater said 
The two sides have agreed to begin this work immediately upon 
resumption of negotiations on Monday We hope that the sides will 
continue to make expeditious progress in these talks 
The statement was released as President Reagan arrived in 
California for a fiveday stay
