Former minister Walker Railey says the peace he 
sought by moving to San Francisco has eluded him as questions 
persist about the nearfatal strangling attack on his wife 
Railey says he is weary and resentful of the scrutiny of his 
private life attention which grew after his inlaws filed a civil 
lawsuit accusing him of attacking Margaret Peggy Railey 
Im kind of between the devil and the deep blue sea Railey 
told the Dallas Morning News in an interview published Sunday 
And in a situation like that its hard to know what is the 
best most honest and responsible way to respond said the former 
senior minister at the First United Methodist Church 
Railey has told police he found his 39yearold wife strangled 
nearly to death the night of April 21 1987 in the garage of their 
home Mrs Railey is now comatose in nursing home 
On Feb 2 Raileys inlaws filed a lawsuit that accused Railey 
of maliciously and knowingly trying to choke his wife to death The 
petition seeks unspecified damages to cover Mrs Raileys past and 
future pain suffering and anguish from the attack 
Railey says he is innocent and police have not filed charges 
In November Railey moved to San Francisco after giving 
guardianship of his wife to her parents and custody of his two 
children to friends Since the lawsuit was filed he has stayed in 
hotels and with friends instead of his apartment saying he is 
trying to avoid reporters and photographers 
In the interview Railey refused to give an account of his 
actions on April 21 
I get the impression that most peoples minds have been made 
up a fairly long time I give the press credit for that I was 
tried and convicted by the public media very early he told the 
newspaper 
Railey also declined to discuss his relationship with 
psychologist Lucy Papillon who told a grand jury she had dated 
Railey and who jointly signed the oneyear lease on Raileys San 
Francisco apartment 
The former minister said he sought job opportunities and a 
chance to regroup emotionally when he moved to San Francisco 
He said he is living off savings and from his share of equity 
from the sale of the Dallas house that he shared with Mrs Railey 
and their two children
