Former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont 
abandoned his bid for the Republican presidential nomination 
Thursday after losing badly in Iowa and New Hampshire You 
listened considered and chose he said I could not have asked 
for more 
Du Pont withdrew just six days after Alexander Haig gave up his 
GOP candidacy leaving four Republicans in the 1988 race Former 
Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt dropped out earlier Thursday leaving 
six Democrats 
Du Pont 53 a former congressman and state legislator as well 
as governor is a greatgreat grandson of the founder of the Du 
Pont Co Despite his efforts and the familiarity of his name his 
candidacy never attracted widespread support in the 17 months after 
he announced his presidential plans 
He had hoped to make himself the conservative alternative to GOP 
frontrunners George Bush and Bob Dole but he finished far down in 
the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary 
In New Hampshire on Tuesday he won his only two delegates 
finishing a distant fourth behind conservative Rep Jack Kemp 
though slightly ahead of former television evangelist Pat Robertson 
He said Thursday he wouldnt endorse another candidate 
immediately 
Bushs chief of staff Craig Fuller told reporters accompanying 
the vice president to Texas that Bush had received a call from du 
Pont on Air Force Two 
Fuller described the conversation as very friendly and 
quoted Bush as telling the former Delaware governor Pete Ive 
been there myself Barbara and I wish you and your family the very 
best 
Fuller described the rest of the 10minute conversation as 
private although he said the two voiced a general willingness 
to talk at some time in the future 
Asked what they would talk about Fuller said it would involve 
the possibility of du Pont endorsing Bush saying its an 
interest we would have I believe whe phone call was simply to 
let the vice president know he was withdrawing from the race 
In his withdrawal announcement made to about 100 supporters 
many wearing Pete 1992 stickers du Pont said Today our 
campaign lowers its flag but our crusade continues to march 
You have given me the opportunity of a lifetime he said 
thanking his supporters for their efforts in his behalf 
In America we do not promise that everyone wins only that 
everyone has the opportunity to try You have given me the 
opportunity he said 
Du Pont took note of his controversial stands on such issues as 
mandatory drug testing for high school students and elimination of 
farm subsidies 
We have moved those challenges forward to the center of the 
debate they are urgent they are real they will not disappear 
he said Neither will our efforts to address them All of us can 
pause to catch our breath none of us should think it time to end 
our quest 
Earlier Fred Stern du Ponts press secretary said in a 
telephone interview that financing was a major consideration in the 
withdrawal decision He said the candidate would not run a 
deficit campaign 
Du Pont raised 75 million and was left with 350000 after New 
Hampshire Stern said But the campaign would have faced large 
expenses to carry on through the 20state Super Tuesday contests 
March 8 
Were solvent right now and we have enough money to run the 
campaign for another two weeks Unlike some of the campaigns were 
meeting our payroll Stern said 
Du Ponts conservative credentials were polished by his 
endorsement from the Union Leader newspaper of Manchester NH 
Du Pont declared his candidacy Sept 16 1986 making him 
officially the first Republican in the field 
Im in a wonderful position he said at the time Im 
unknown Im underrated and theres nowhere to go but up 
That same day du Pont took off for Manchester NH In an 
interview later that week with the Wilmington NewsJournal he said 
if he did not do well in Iowa and New Hampshire he would pull out 
of the race On Thursday he was true to his word 
Being first to announce he drew national attention 
particularly for his provocative stands on several issues 
including drug testing creation of a private alternative to Social 
Security modeled after IRA accounts and the replacement of welfare 
with a mandatory jobs program 
Thursday evening du Pont thanked several hundred supporters for 
their help during a farewell campaign party at a local high school 
All of us are here tonight to celebrate what for me has been 
the greatest opportunity of my lifetime he said 
Now some of you are tired and you deserve to rest And some of 
you are sad and youre not allowed to be sad because this is not a 
sad occasion du Pont said This is a celebration of a campaign 
for the presidency of the United States It was run the way 
campaigns ought to be run on principles on issues
