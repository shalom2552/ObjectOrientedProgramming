Security forces Sunday dispersed 
more than 400 demonstrators who gathered in a downtown square to 
demand human rights 
Five people were arrested after police broke up the protest 
which began after an official observance of the 43rd anniversary of 
the Allied bombing of Dresden 
Church leaders speaking on condition of anonymity said late 
Sunday the five detainees were released after questioning There 
were no reports of injuries 
The protesters unfurled banners demanding more human rights and 
called on the communist East German government to allow freedom of 
travel to the West Many shouted The Wall Must Go and We 
want freedom 
It was the first time a demonstration of that size had taken 
place in the city protesters said 
Communist authorities in 1961 erected a heavily fortified wall 
between East Germany and West Germany The barrier also divides 
Berlin 
As the protesters prepared to leave the Dresden square police 
moved in and dragged away the five activists and detained them 
briefly in the nearby Palace of Culture Police blocked an attempt 
by other demonstrators to storm the building 
The square then was cleared by at least 100 uniformed and 
plainclothes police 
On Saturday afternoon several protesters raised banners 
demanding more freedom during a ceremony marking the Allied bombing 
of Dresden on Feb 13 1945 
The banners were quickly ripped down and confiscated by security 
forces 
Witnesses said one man was arrested for carrying a banner that 
read Freedom for Those Who Think Differently 
More than 100 people were arrested in East Berlin last month for 
attempting to demonstrate at a statesanctioned rally honoring the 
founders of the German Communist Party 
East German authorities have since expelled more than 60 of the 
East Berlin dissidents including several prominent East German 
artists 
Four protesters were arrested last week during a visit to East 
Berlin by West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen They have since been 
released officials in West Berlin said Saturday
