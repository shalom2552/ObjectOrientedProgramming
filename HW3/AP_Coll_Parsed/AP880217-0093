Jesse Jackson said today that his fourth 
place finish in New Hampshires Democratic primary proved we 
could broaden our base and that he expects to win as the 
presidential campaign moves South 
Our message of end economic violence and stop drugs from 
coming into our country hit at the heart of the families of working 
people he said in an interview on CBS This Morning 
He said that in both Iowa and New Hampshire We proved that we 
could broaden our base appeal to voters across the country 
Jackson finished ahead of rivals Albert Gore Bruce Babbitt and 
Gary Hart in Tuesday nights New Hampshire primary and last weeks 
Iowa caucuses He already has met with Babbitt to ask for his 
support 
In many ways he has been a part of the heart and soul of this 
campaign Jackson said of Babbitt We have an awful lot in 
common 
Jackson had campaign appearances scheduled today in Tallahassee 
Fla and Mobile Ala 
Im a son of the South I know its ways Jackson a South 
Carolina native said after the returns were counted Tuesday night 
Ive worked harder and longer to make the new South new than 
anyone in this campaign Jackson said citing his work for voting 
rights and open housing 
Jackson was particularly jubilant about his New Hampshire 
showing He said his campaign spent only 45000 in the state far 
less than opponents Michael Dukakis Paul Simon and Richard 
Gephardt yet it gathered enough support to give him momemtum going 
into Super Tuesday 
We defied the odds They outspent us 10toone and yet we 
keep getting stronger and stronger and stronger Jackson said 
Gore who also eschewed a strong New Hampshire effort in favor 
of southern campaigning will not pose a problem for Jackson the 
civil rights leader said 
Im not worried about anybody he said 
Jackson also jabbed at primary winner Dukakis We cannot just 
take the uncollected taxes of the Reagan revolution he said 
referring to Dukakis plan to cut federal budget deficits by 
collecting 110 billion in overdue income taxes 
Supporters who munched on cold fried chicken and clustered 
around televisions to check on network projections said fourth 
place was more than satisfactory 
Its real acceptable Fourth is about what wed like to do 
here so were happy said state Rep Robert Cushing Jacksons 
state campaign cochairman
