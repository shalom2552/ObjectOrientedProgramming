The Army withdrew a fullpage advertisement from 
the February edition of Student Lawyer magazine because the issue 
featured an article on homosexual law students the magazines 
editor said Friday 
The decision to pull the ad came shortly before a federal 
appeals court on Wednesday overturned as unconstitutional the 
Armys ban on homosexuals editor Sarah Hoban said 
It is very ironic the timing couldnt be better she said 
The cover article in Februarys edition of the magazine a 
publication of the American Bar Association is titled The Legal 
Closet The piece by Chicago freelance writer Lynn Miller is an 
examination of gay law students and contends that antigay fears 
and prejudices are common in law schools and within many law 
practices 
In a note to readers Ms Hoban said the writer had encountered 
many people who were afraid to discuss homosexuality In the note 
she said an advertisement had been withdrawn from the issue but 
did not identify the advertiser as being the Army 
Ms Hoban told the Chicago Tribune on Friday that the advertiser 
was the Army and the ad had been withdrawn by the Armys New 
Yorkbased advertising firm Young amp Rubicam 
Ms Hoban said she suspected that the Army might be bothered by 
the article so she had her advertising director contact Young amp 
Rubicam and tell the firm that the article would appear in the 
February issue 
Young amp Rubicam then withdrew the ad 
They didnt threaten us she said They just said they 
wanted to pull it Its their right though Im sorry they did it 
just a week before we went into production for this issue 
Young amp Rubicam could not be reached for comment by telephone 
late Friday Calls after business hours to the agencys Chicago and 
New York offices went unanswered 
Lt Col John Cullen chief of public affairs for the Army 
Recruiting Command at Fort Sheridan Ill said Young amp Rubicam 
consulted the Army before deciding to pull the ad 
Its not their money after all said Cullen who said the 
agency had been told by Student Lawyer that the article contained 
material uncomplimentary toward the military 
The magazine initiated it and we took the option Cullen 
said of the decision to pull the ad 
Cullen said the Army intended to continue advertising in future 
issues of Student Lawyer
