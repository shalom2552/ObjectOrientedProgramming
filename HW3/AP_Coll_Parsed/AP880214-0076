Soviet technicians will visit Utah this week 
to review living arrangements for inspectors who will be stationed 
here to verify compliance with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces 
Treaty an official said 
At the same time a threemember US contingent will travel to 
the Soviet Union to conduct a similar tour Sen Orrin Hatch said 
Saturday The visit of the Soviet technicians is scheduled for 
Wednesday and Thursday 
Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a compound near the 
Hercules Bacchus West plant in western Salt Lake County under terms 
of the INF pact which bans production of intermediaterange 
missiles 
The treaty was signed in December by President Reagan and Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev but still faces ratification by the Senate 
The Soviet inspectors will monitor the Hercules plant which 
developed motors for Pershing 2 missiles now banned under the 
treaty 
The American team will be stationed in the Soviet city of 
Votkinsk where SS20 nuclear weapons were made said Dave Porter 
an aide to Hatch Votkinsk about 600 miles east of Moscow near the 
Ural Mountains has been closed to foreign visitors 
The two countries advance teams will meet in Moscow a week 
after the tours to discuss housing travel restrictions and other 
arrangements for the inspectors said Hatch RUtah 
The inspection teams could be settled in each nation within 60 
days of Senate ratification of the treaty 
State Department officials will accompany the Soviet technicians 
on a tour of the area within 31 miles of the Hercules plant Soviet 
inspectors later could be allowed to travel within that zone 
Porter said this weeks tours are the first of many such 
meetings planned before the inspection teams arrive 
The treaty spells out few details of living arrangements 
leaving them to the two host countries 
Hatch who has said he believes virtually all of the Soviet 
inspectors in Utah will be spies has asked for a secret study of 
security precautions for as many as 63 government contractors 
located within a 31mile radius of the Hercules plant 
The senator also has called for restrictions on the inspectors 
to reduce the possibility of espionage Any limitations imposed 
would be reciprocal he said
