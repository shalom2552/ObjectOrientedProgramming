Gen Alfredo Stroessners landslide 
victory in the presidential election was achieved through 
widespread fraud according to opposition leaders and foreign 
observers 
The 75yearold president and his governing Colorado Party on 
Sunday won an eighth straight term receiving 886 percent of the 
vote Interior Minister Sabino Montanaro announced Montanaro is 
also party president 
Stroessner elected to a fiveyearterm has governed the nation 
of 38 million people since taking power in an army coup in 1954 
One opposition leader was detained during the voting 
Opposition groups and foreign representatives invited to observe 
the voting said they witnessed irregularities that included the 
absence of opposition ballots at polling stations a lack of closed 
booths to ensure secret balloting voting by underage voters and 
ballot box stuffing 
Stroessner is the Western Hemispheres longest governing head of 
state Among current world leaders only North Koreas KimIl Sung 
who came to power in 1948 has led a country longer 
The unofficial final vote tally announced by the party today 
gave the Colorado Party and Stroessner 1186693 or 886 percent 
of the total cast A total of 1446665 voters were registered 
The Radical Liberal Party whose presidential candidate was Sen 
Luis Maria Vega 65 was a distant second with 96231 votes or 
718 percent The Liberal Party led by Rep Carlos Ferreira 
Ybarra 54 was third with 42056 votes or 314 percent Final 
returns were expected to be released later today 
The government said voter turnout was high but did not provide 
a figure The opposition said turnout was lower than 50 percent in 
many urban areas 
The victory which Montanaro called proof the Colorado Party 
with Stroessner holds an absolute majority in the countryside and 
the cities also gave the party twothirds of the 72 House of 
Deputies and 36 Senate seats 
The remaining onethird will be split among the two other 
parties according to the proportion of votes the two losers 
received 
The opposition candidates who participated Sunday represented 
two of the countrys three officially recognized opposition groups 
The third party the Febrerista Revolutionary Party has not 
participated in elections or government since 1973 
Three unrecognized parties the Authentic Radical Liberal Party 
the Christian Democrats and the Colorado Popular Movement had 
urged voters to boycott the elections 
Domingo Laino president of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party 
was detained most of Sunday at a government office in Col Oviedo 
80 miles east of Asuncion and released when the polls had closed 
He then held a news conference to denounce the elections 
The fraud of Feb 14 will not be like others Laino said 
It will be Stroessners burial ground 
Jo Marie Greisgaber a US consultant to the Washingtonbased 
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs a 
Democratic Party entity said she witnessed underage voters casting 
ballots in Col Oviedo 
We also were told that area cotton farmers had been told 
cotton prices would not be increased if they did not vote or that 
they would not be able to sell their crops she said 
A US observer with the same institute Martin Andersen said a 
car in which he and opposition politicians were riding was stopped 
in Ypacarai 15 miles east of Asuncion by a group of men in 
plainclothes and police uniforms 
We were mistreated without provocation and treated in a 
beastly fashion said Andersen 
He said the cars driver Carlos Romero Perreira leader of a 
dissident faction of the Colorado Party was struck several times 
Uruguayan lawmaker Daniel Lamas said he saw voters barred from 
casting ballots in secret as well as individuals casting up to 10 
ballots 
Most opposition rallies at Asuncion and a halfdozen other towns 
were peaceful But in Carapegua 30 miles south of Asuncion police 
armed with clubs broke up a demonstration and a rally at Col 
Oviedo was suspended due to fear of violence 
Last week the US State Department criticized Stroessners 
government in its 1987 human rights report which said Paraguay 
has not had a democratic government since its independence in 
1811 
In the victory speech Montanaro promised the government would 
promote investment of domestic and foreign capital combat 
unemployment eliminate slums and shantytowns and distribute land 
to poor farmers 
We will continue to be anticommunist he emphasized and 
no one will surprise us flirting with Marxism wherever it may be
