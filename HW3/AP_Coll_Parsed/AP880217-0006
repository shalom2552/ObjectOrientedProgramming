It was once known as the Black Country 
because of its long winters harsh terrain and hard life Even at 
the dawn of this century it still was a land of barbarian tribes 
and powerful feudal warriors one of Japans last frontiers 
Warrior clans and impoverished peasants lived in isolation among 
its vast mountain ranges 
But it had a bucolic tranquility and Japanese poured in from all 
over to enjoy what Japan once was volcanic hot springs and rugged 
seascapes folk crafts and villages old temples and teahouses 
welltended apple orchards and rice fields 
This is Tohoku the Black Countrys formal name and it takes up 
the entire northern end of Honshu Japans main island 
But Tohokus leaders are planning to catapult Tohoku into the 
21st century turning the region into a hub of technological 
progress filled with hightech factories seaports and 
telecommunications centers 
If that happens some fear Tohokus culture and way of life 
will vanish 
Some of it already has 
New highways and highspeed train lines have brought modern 
Japan closer to Tohoku Thousands upon thousands come to its ski 
resorts and lakes snowscapes and primieval marshes in three 
national parks all offering a respite from the urban plain around 
Tokyo a little over 100 miles to the south 
Sendai is now Tohokus largest city with 700000 residents 
Devastated by World War II bombing its broad treelined boulevards 
are a rare product of postwar city planning 
Between Tohokus growing cities lie vast wooded mountains and 
cultivated plains where people carry on a simpler more 
traditional Japanese lifestyle 
Most live in houses that are huge by comparison with those in 
Tokyo but they lack central heating and flush toilets Peoples 
lives are suited to the seasons The cold winter months are spend 
clustered around quiltcovered heaters called kotatsu and 
observing the traditional festivals and rituals tied to the 
planting and harvesting of rice 
But in Sendai the Tohoku Federation of Economic Organizations 
a powerful business alliance is planning a leap into the 21st 
century 
If the federation has its way rustic northern Japan will become 
a network of technolopolises marinopolises teletopias and a 
magmapolis modern cities based on high technology seaports 
telecommunications and power generation and tourism tied to 
volcanic activity 
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshitas Furusato Hometown 
Concept a plan to establish centers of industry and culture in 
rural Japan is further encouragement for Tohokus planners 
More than 34 foreign firms and some of Japans leading 
electronics companies already have moved their factories from Tokyo 
to industrial parks in Tohoku attracted by tax incentives lower 
land costs and abundant water and energy 
Real estate cost an average 9 a square foot in Tohoku in 1987 
compared with 11050 in suburban Tokyo 
Several company presidents said fresh skilled labor drew their 
firms to Tohoku where the people are known for their serious 
character and diligence 
Federation officials maintain that hightech industrial 
development poses little threat to the Tohokus environment 
But opponents claim the air already has become polluted around 
heavily used roads and that even clean semiconductor factories 
must use dangerous chemicals 
About onetenth of Japans 121 million people the same number 
that live in Tokyo live in all of Tohoku which makes up 20 
percent of Japans land area 
Toshio Tamakawa chairman of the Tohoku federation and president 
of the regions largest corporation Tohoku Electric Power says 
Tohoku is an attractive alternative to Tokyos congestion and high 
prices 
People used to say Tohoku was a barbarian hinterland he 
said They certainly cant say that anymore 
Nearby Matsushima Pine Island is still considered one of the 
most beautiful spots in Japan but the Pacific coast to north and 
south is a mass of grey factories and shipyards 
Modernization has brought flashy department stores and hotels to 
Sendai along with subways urban sprawl and traffic jams 
But even in quieter less developed areas life is changing 
A few hours north of Sendai in Hiraizumi taxi driver Kirio 
Aoyanagi in blue uniform and white gloves talks of how he 
returned to his native town from miserably lonely Tokyo after 
living there almost 10 years to marry and raise his family 
Aoyanagi now guides tourists through ancient temples and 
describes the floods wars and fires that destroyed most of 
Hiraizumi a city built around 1100 by the powerful Fujiwara clan 
that was once a center of political power 
Aoyanagi says he and others cant live by farming alone and 
need factory jobs But he worries that old traditions are 
disappearing as Tohoku grows more modern and less isolated 
Its not like it used to be he said People are becoming 
selfcentered just like in Tokyo The younger generation is 
completely different 
A giant Buddhas face loomed out of a nearby cliff in a quiet 
mountain valley Below a group of farmers in traditional aprons 
and kerchiefs worked at rethatching a farmhouse roof a picture 
of the past 
I want to keep Tohoku a good place to live Aoyanagi said 
where people care about each other and not just their money
