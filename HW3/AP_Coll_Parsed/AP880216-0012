Pat Robertson had just finished a strident 
anticommunist sermon to the Chamber of Commerce when Kent Evans 
stood up and told the Republican candidate what was on his mind 
Im shaking he said Im sitting here really afraid when 
you start talk about going to war 
It was a dramatic moment on the eve of the crucial New Hampshire 
primary where Robertson hoped for another surprising finish in the 
wake of his upstart secondplace showing in Iowa 
After several minutes of backandforth Robertson told Evans 
I dont know what else to say except that peace will come through 
strength Maybe would you prefer to live under communism I 
dont know Id rather be free 
The confrontation with the Portsmouth merchant highlighted the 
strong reaction some have to Robertsons foreign policy positions 
It also came as the GOP hopeful was embroiled in a controversy 
about Soviet missiles and Cuba Robertson said during a Sunday 
night debate that Soviet mediumrange missiles are still based on 
the island although he backed off the assertion Monday saying he 
had no such firsthand knowledge 
Robertson drew criticism from his opponents for the comment in 
tones that echoed Evans fears 
This is a very serious allegation Bush said in an interview 
on a Manchester NH radio station You keep hearing these 
outrageous charges which are designed to scare the American 
people 
Rep Jack Kemp of New York called it a rather rash and 
unsupportable charge 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said SS4 and SS5 
missile sites established in Cuba in 1962 were confirmed as 
having been destroyed in that year 
At the Chamber of Commerce candidate forum Robertson gave his 
standard speech with a strong defense of America and strong 
denunciations of communism as the greatest evil the nation faces 
After hearing what Robertson had to say this was Evans 
reaction He advocates using weapons and war as a solution to all 
the problems in the world Thats isnt a solution thats 
annihilation 
Robertson talked of the Berlin Wall calling it an abomination 
that the United State should have stopped 
Had I been president when that was done there would have been 
US tanks on the move to knock that thing down Robertson said 
And that was too much for Evans who runs an office furniture 
store 
Im sitting here really afraid when you start talk about going 
to war the way you just talked about it the result of taking tanks 
to the Berlin Wall said Evans With all that talk of war not 
understanding the threat we face today from nuclear weapons We 
can no longer do it 
Part of the audience of 250 applauded Evans Robertson asked who 
he supports and Evans said Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole 
Robertson nodded and went on to compare the current situation to 
the challenge posed by Adolf Hitlers Germany in the 1930s 
Had we been resolute in the face of dictatorship that would 
never have happened I am for peace with all of my heart 
Robertson said 
Evans broke in There were not nuclear weapons when Hitler was 
there You need to address the root cause before it comes up to a 
Hitler not afterward with weapons 
The former television evangelist was clearly irritated by Evans 
questions but pressed on 
You have somebody who is every bit as bad as Hitler in charge 
of many nations of the world Robertson said Communism is just 
as bad as the Nazis If we want to have peace in our world it 
is absolutely essential that we stand up resolutely to communism 
Several times later during the appearance Robertson returned to 
Evans to address his concerns 
At one point he said This gentleman had all the concerns 
Sir I want to eliminate nuclear weapons from the face of the 
earth
