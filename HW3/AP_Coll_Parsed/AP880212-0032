A couple whose daughter spurned an 
arranged marriage and eloped with her cousin allegedly tried to 
hire a hitman to kill their soninlaw his sister and mother and 
send pieces of the bodies to Jordan authorities said Friday 
Dr Saud Tarawneh 46 a gynecologist who became a US citizen 
in 1980 and his wife Ghada 44 were arrested Thursday on a 
Broward County warrant in Toledo Ohio where they have lived for 
several years Bond for them was set Friday at 12 million 
According to Mike Breece an investigator with the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement the couple allegedly tried to 
arrange the killings to erase the embarrassment from Rhana 
Tarawnehs elopement with her Syrian cousin in 1984 
This would not only help them save face but elevate the 
standing of the family in the tribe to an even higher level than it 
was before the daughter ran away Breece said 
The lovers fled from Jordan and eventually moved to Broward 
County 
Police were contacted by a private investigator the Tarawnehs 
allegedly asked either to commit the murders himself or arrange for 
a hitman 
Tarawneh and his wife were each charged with three counts of 
conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder and three counts of 
solicitation to commit firstdegree murder 
The alleged intended targets were their unwanted soninlaw 
Mouataz Abdulsamad 29 his younger sister Azza and his mother 
Najwa 45 
When Rhana first fled Jordan with her new husband the family 
wanted to send her back and sell her into a prostitution ring 
authorities said 
But as the embarrassment to the family grew deeper the parents 
allegedly tried to set up the killings of her new husband and his 
relatives 
The plans included instructions for the killer to to hang all 
three people take photographs of the bodies then cut the mothers 
tongue out and sexually mutilate the husband and his sister Breece 
said Instructions were also included on packaging the body parts 
in formaldehyde for shipment to Jordan 
Breece would not disclose the amount the couple allegedly agreed 
to pay for the murders 
An investigator the parents allegedly tried to hire in early 
January told authorities about the plot and agreed to cooperate 
with the state in its criminal investigation Breece said 
After getting court permission for wiretaps agents taped phone 
conversations between the investigator and the family Breece said 
A state agent and the investigator who acted as a middle man 
for a nonexistent hitman met with the doctor and his wife in 
Detroit on Feb 2 Breece said 
On Wednesday the father was told the the murders had been 
committed and to send his money Breece said Whether or not he 
did send the money I dont know 
Toledo Municipal Court Judge Robert Penn continued the case 
until Saturday because the Tarawnehs attorney Jeffrey Goldstein 
was out of town The couple faces extradition to Florida Breece 
said
