The US trade deficit narrowed to 122 
billion in December the smallest gap since January as exports hit 
a record the Commerce Department said today 
For the year the trade deficit widened to 1712 billion the 
largest ever But financial markets were expected to pay more 
attention to the December numbers which came two months after the 
Oct 19 stock market crash 
Decembers merchandise trade deficit of 122 billion was an 
improvement from the 132 billion gap posted in November 
Decembers deficit the smallest since Januarys 119 billion 
shortfall was paced by a record 248 billion in exports a 42 
percent improvement over November Novembers gain had also 
resulted from surging exports 
Imports meanwhile were at 37 billion in December the same 
level as in the previous month 
Still for the year the differnce between what the United 
States imported and what it exported soared 96 percent from the 
previous record deficit of 1562 billion in 1986 
For all of 1987 imports totaled 4241 billion and exports 
totaled 2529 billion up from imports of 383 billion and 
exports of 2268 billion in 1986 
The Reagan administration was quick to hail the new numbers 
Trade Representative Clayton K Yeutter said the drop in the 
deficit is good news particularly since this is the second 
straight monthly decline We hope this is a sign that there are 
better days ahead on the trade front 
Jay Goldinger economist for Cantor Fitzgerald a Los Angeles 
bond brokerage said the trade figures demonstrate we are in the 
middle of a major change in course on the balanceoftrade 
But its a big ship And you dont turn it on a dime But at 
least we know were headed home Goldinger said 
Exports have been climbing in recent months under pressure from 
a weaker dollar which makes US goods more competitive abroad 
while driving up the price of imports 
Government and private economists have suggested that an export 
boom could be the major factor in finally bringing down the trade 
deficit which has been increasing steadily since the late 1970s 
The United States continued to run its largest deficit with 
Japan 598 billion in 1987 up from 586 billion in 1986 
The deficit with Western Europe however narrowed to 302 
billion from 327 billion The deficit with Taiwan increased to 
190 billion from 157 billion And with Canada it was down to 
117 billion from 132 billion 
The deficit with South Korea in 1987 was 99 billion up from 
71 billion in 1986 With Hong Kong it was up to 65 billion 
from 64 billion And with Mexico the US trade shortfall rose 
to 59 billion from 52 billion in 1986 
For December alone the trade defcit with Japan was 48 
billion about the same as November with Western Europe 27 
billion up from 24 billion with Canada 6328 million down 
from 13 billion with Taiwan 11 billion down from 12 
billion with South Korea 7628 million up from 7602 million 
Imports for all of 1987 were up 107 percent while exports rose 
115 percent That compares to an 87 percent rise in imports in 
1986 and only a 37 percent rise in exports 
For the full year imports of manufactured goods rose to 3252 
billion from 2938 billion Oil imports surged to 448 billion 
from 376 billion 
Meanwhile exports of US manufactured goods were up to 1715 
billion from 1487 billion in 1986 
In agricultural goods one of the few categories where the 
United States maintained a trade surplus exports were up to 286 
billion from 261 billion in 1987 
New car imports from Japan were 20 billion in December the 
same level as in November For the year car imports from Japan 
totaled 222 billion up slightly from 220 billion in 1986 
New auto imports from Canada were 10 billion in December down 
from 12 billion in November and 102 billion for the year 
down from 118 billion in 1986 
From other countries auto imports were 16 billion up from 
15 billion in November and 168 billion for all of 1987 up 
from 127 billion 
The monthly trade figures which governmment analysts caution 
can be misleading because they are not adjusted for either seasonal 
factors or inflation have become one of the most closely watched 
set of government statistics by financial markets 
In fact the task force appointed by President Reagan to study 
the market collapse identified a weakerthanexpected trade report 
released in early October as one factor triggering the 508point 
stock price plunge 
A weaker dollar can help ease the US trade deficit by making 
imports more expensive and US goods more competitive abroad But 
reports of a smaller trade deficit tend to raise the value of the 
dollar which in turn can cause the deficit to widen 
The Reagan administration in past months has joined with its 
major economic allies in seeking a stable dollar against other key 
currencies Too rapid a fall in the value of the dollar can produce 
inflation 
The dollar has fallen 50 percent since mid1985 against the 
Japanese yen and key European currencies
