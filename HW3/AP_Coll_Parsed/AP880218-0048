A Socialist and a saxophonist are among 
the dozens of Arizonans 77 at last count lining up for the 
chance to run against Gov Evan Mecham in a May 17 recall election 
Only two Democrat Carolyn Warner and former US House minority 
leader John Rhodes a Republican are given any real chance by 
political observers of unseating the impeached GOP governor 
But some of the lesserknowns still insist their candidacies are 
worthwhile 
Dave Colosimo of Phoenix a former teacher and a saxophone 
player in local bands said he is working fulltime on the race 
If I didnt think I could win I wouldnt run Colosimo said 
If I can run a household with five children and a wife then I 
think Id be pretty able to balance the books when I got into the 
office 
However Colosimo acknowledged his candidacy so far is a 
oneman show He has never sought public office before but 
said I was president of my senior class thats a joke 
Meanwhile the state Senate on Wednesday granted Mecham a 
oneweek delay of his impeachment trial originally set to begin 
Monday but defeated two motions for further delay offered by the 
embattled governors attorney Murray Miller 
The Senate rejected Millers request that the trial be put off 
until criminal charges accusing Mecham of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan are tried The lawyer had contended that an 
impeachment trial would prejudice the criminal trial jury 
Arizona Chief Justice Frank Gordon who will preside at the 
impeachment trial told the Senate a oneweek delay would 
ultimately save time by allowing some issues to be settled 
beforehand 
If Mecham is convicted in his impeachment trial lawmakers could 
vote to bar him from holding any future political office 
At this point Mecham will automatically be placed on the recall 
ballot All other wouldbe candidates in the winnertakeall vote 
must file at least 3336 valid petition signatures of registered 
voters by March 18 
The secretary of states office said 77 people had picked up 
packets to collect petition signatures by Wednesday Wednesday was 
the first day for candidates to file petition signatures but none 
did 
Among the earliest to pick up packets were Mrs Warner the 
former state schools superintendent who lost to Mecham in a 
threeway race in November 1986 and Rhodes who has said he will 
announce Friday whether he will run 
Other potential candidates range from Republican national 
committeeman Jack Londen who said he was considering running to 
preserve the conservative alternative if Mecham is barred from 
running to Bernie Senter a meatpacker who ran for mayor of 
Phoenix last fall as the Socialist Workers Party candidate 
Senter conceded that he cant win but said he also wants to 
provide voters with an alternative 
Im against everything that he Mecham stands for Senter 
said citing the governors cancellation of a state holiday 
celebrating Martin Luther King Jrs birthday 
Mecham who also has been criticized for making remarks that 
have angered blacks homosexuals Jews women and the Japanese did 
not return telephone calls seeking comment on the number of 
potential candidates 
Democratic Secretary of State Rose Mofford who is acting 
governor pending Mechams impeachment trial has no plans to run in 
the recall election said her spokeswoman Athia Hardt If she 
does state law will probably force her to resign 
Further complicating matters Attorney General Bob Corbin has 
issued an opinion saying that if Mecham is removed from office 
before the recall vote Mrs Mofford as the new governor would 
have to face the recall herself 
Its all messed up it really is Ms Hardt said 
The Senate is considering a bill that would cancel the recall 
election if Mecham resigns or is removed before the ballot is 
printed
