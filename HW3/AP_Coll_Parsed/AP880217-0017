When Sen Joseph Biden experienced a pain in 
the neck he was placed in a brace until it felt better But last 
week when the pain came back suddenly doctors found an aneurysm on 
the brain that required delicate surgery to save his life 
The surgery performed last Friday was so successful that 
doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Tuesday transferred 
the 45yearold Delaware Democrat out of intensive care and into a 
regular hospital room 
Physicians are pleased with his continued progress and his 
condition is listed as satisfactory said Peter Esker a Walter 
Reed spokesman 
A neurosurgeon familiar with the Biden case said many patients 
with cerebral aneurysms are not as lucky particularly if there is 
rapid and serious bleeding 
It can kill you in 10 minutes said the surgeon who asked 
not to be named Most patients survive he added but for a 
serious medical condition aneurysms on the brain are big time 
The doctor said that Biden is in the lucky twothirds who 
live through cerebral aneurysm surgery and the senators 
relatively quick release from intensive care probably means he 
avoided a long list of problems that can ambush such patients 
One third of these patients die said the surgeon while 
others may experience some loss of function such as paralysis or 
decline of intellectual ability But if everything is perfect and 
the surgery is within 24 hours of serious bleeding they can be 
out of the hospital within seven days Recovery can be absolutely 
normal 
Dr Edward Laws chairman of the neurosurgery department at 
George Washington Hospital said he had no details on the Biden 
case but that patients with successful surgery usually are released 
within a week or 10 days 
It sounds like he Biden is doing better than that though 
said Laws I think hes probably going to do great 
An aneurysm is caused by a weakness in the artery wall that 
allows pressure to force the artery to swell outward like a 
blister The danger is that the aneurysm will burst But in the 
brain even a mild leakage can be dangerous and damaging 
A leakage into the brain from a branch of the carotid artery can 
cause a neck pain but both Laws and the other neurosurgeon said it 
is unusual for such a pain to be misdiagnosed 
Laws suggested that Biden in fact may have had a neck problem 
earlier and that development of the aneurysm which manifests a 
similar pain was just coincidental 
Biden first complained of the neck pain in late January 
Jane Berman an aide in Bidens Washington office said when the 
senator sought medical care he was issued a brace 
They thought he had a pinched nerve and a viral infection in 
the neck at the same time she said 
Biden chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee wore a neck 
brace in late January during hearings on the nomination of Anthony 
Kennedy to the Supreme Court A week later the senator was too ill 
to vote on the confirmation 
But last week Biden felt well enough to take off the brace and 
accept several speaking engagements at East Coast colleges Ms 
Berman said 
In Rochester NY the pain returned suddenly and powerfully 
and Biden also experienced nausea 
He went home to Wilmington Del and immediately was admitted 
to St Francis Hospital for tests 
One of these tests was a CAT scan a sophisticated Xray 
technique The aneurysm was spotted and Biden quickly was 
transferred by ambulance early Friday morning to Walter Reed where 
surgery began only hours later 
Laws said that typically in such a procedure an incision is made 
in the temple area of the head Surgeons then cut a small window 
through the wall of the skull and the brain is raised slightly to 
gain access to the aneurysm site 
To correct the flaw surgeons use a clip a small metal device 
with two tiny jaws that lock together The clip is placed at the 
base of the aneurysm parallel to the flow of blood Left in place 
permanently the clip isolates the weak spot and allows the artery 
to heal 
The procedure said Laws is microsurgery because the 
artery which he described as like a piece of wet spaghetti is 
so small 
It is very difficult and delicate surgery he said
