Irelands prime minister said after a 
chilly meeting with Margaret Thatcher on Friday he was not satified 
with the British attitude in a dispute over police conduct in 
Northern Ireland 
British officials said the 30minute meeting between Prime 
Minister Thatcher and Charles Haughey of Ireland was calm and 
dignified but an Irish statement said Haughey could not regard 
the present response of the British government in the areas of 
principal concern as satisfactory 
The statement said Haughey was still waiting for an adequate 
response to Irish protests made at an intergovernmental meeting 
Feb 2 
Fridays meeting was the first between the two leaders since 
Britain acknowledged on Jan 25 that there was evidence of a 
coverup after police in the British province killed six unarmed 
Roman Catholics in three separate incidents in 1982 
Britain said there would be no prosecutions There are fears the 
affair could damage the AngloIrish Agreement which is aimed at 
bolstering the Catholic minoritys confidence in British justice in 
Northern Ireland 
Mrs Thatcher expressed her belief that the AngloIrish 
Agreement must continue as therein lies the future a British 
spokesman said after the meeting referring to the 1985 pact giving 
the Irish Republic a consultative role in Northern Ireland affairs 
He spoke on condition of anonymity following government practice 
The killings of five Irish nationalist guerrillas and a 
teenager prompted charges that police had a shoottokill policy 
An investigation found no evidence of official shoottokill 
tactics but said officers lied and tried to cover up their 
practices 
At Fridays meeting Mrs Thatcher said the decision not to 
prosecute was not influenced by her administration since it was 
made by the Director of Public Prosecutions who is not a member of 
the government 
It was endorsed and announced however by SolicitorGeneral Sir 
Patrick Mayhew a Cabinet member He said prosecutions would not 
promote national security or be in the public interest 
Mrs Thatcher promised Haughey that Tom King her minister for 
Northern Ireland would make a statement soon about the 
organizational implications of the affair the British 
spokesman said 
This was interpreted as a suggestion that Britain is considering 
changes in the Royal Ulster Constablulary which draws most of its 
personnel from the Protestant majority 
King has said disciplinary action could be taken against 
officers involved in the affair 
Haughey and Mrs Thatcher met during an emergency economic 
summit of the 12nation European Economic Community
