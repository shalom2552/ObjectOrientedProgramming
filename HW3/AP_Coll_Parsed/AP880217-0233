Michael Dukakis headed fullspeed from the 
Northeast into a Southern campaign Wednesday spending the day 
after his New Hampshire triumph talking tough on military issues in 
a region where he hopes to take his next big step toward the 
Democratic nomination 
The Massachusetts governor who won a lopsided victory over six 
Democratic rivals in New Hampshire on Tuesday left New England at 
dawn and was in Atlanta and campaigning while his triumph was still 
fresh 
In the next three weeks he will be spending much time and 
money in the South where 14 states will have their primaries on 
March 8 known as Super Tuesday 
Dukakis more liberal than many Southern Democrats put a heavy 
emphasis on the military after a speech in Atlanta declaring he 
would use force to stop a foreign aggressor in this hemisphere or 
to counterattack terrorists 
Im a very tough guy when it comes to terrorism he said 
I dont yield on toughness to Al Gore in any shape or 
manner he added in a reference to the Tennessee senator who has 
staked his campaign on doing well in the South 
Dukakis said his emphasis on defense issues had nothing to do 
with any Southern strategy but came simply because I was asked 
about it He also said some issues are more important to some 
regions than others adding The South for many years has been 
the location for many military installations 
His speech to about 500 spectators was essentially the same as 
his victory speech in Manchester Tuesday night Dukakis used the 
words strong or strength 14 times in a 15minute address 
Former Kentucky Gov Martha Layne Collins and former New Orleans 
Mayor Dutch Morial endorsed Dukakis in his Atlanta appearance 
Collins said that she and her fellow governors used to say of 
Dukakis Now theres something worth watching 
Dukakis said the idea that the South is politically different 
from the rest of the nation is a false image created by the press 
Theres a mythology about the South as if its some kind of 
foreign country Its nonsense Dukakis said 
In his victory speech the previous night Dukakis said I have 
no Southern strategy 
But his aides say his campaign will focus on Texas Florida 
North Carolina and Georgia the four Southern states with the most 
delegates to the Democratic National Convention 
The bottom line is delegates thats what were looking for 
Super Tuesday said Alice Travis Dukakis national political 
coordinator 
Dukakis also is expected to do well in his home state in 
neighboring Rhode Island and in Washington state all of which also 
have contests on March 8 
John Dukakis who is running his fathers Southern campaign 
said Florida Texas North Carolina and Georgia are places where 
we started early Those are the four largest states but were 
everywhere and moving quickly 
In Clearwater Fla Dukakis told about 600 cheering supporters 
I dont have to tell you how important Florida is going be 
Dukakis has led in recent polls in Florida which ranks second 
among Super Tuesday states with 135 Democratic delegates 
He also fired a shot across Gores bow when told the Tennesssee 
senator had accused his opponents of being alienated from the 
electorate 
Mr Gore left Iowa virtually left New Hampshire Dukakis 
said I dont know whos alienated 
Dukakis made it clear Wednesday that he would continue to 
contrast his positions with those of Missouri Rep Richard 
Gephardt who finished second to Dukakis in New Hampshire after 
beating him in Iowa 
On foreign trade one of Gephardts main issues Dukakis said 
A portion of the problem has to do with unfair trade practices 
But he also said the federal budget deficit is the primary culprit 
and he said Gephardt helped create the problem by voting for 
President Reagans 1981 tax cut 
In one strategic uncertainty Dukakis aides say that between 
now and Super Tuesday the Democratic field could narrow forcing a 
more direct comparison of the remaining candidates 
During the New Hampshire campaign Dukakis said negative 
campaigning by his oppoents failed miserably When you have many 
candidates in a race trying to strike out at a number of them 
doesnt work 
The 20 caucuses and primaries on Super Tuesday including 14 in 
the South wont come to Dukakis as easily as New Hampshire his 
aides recognize 
In New Hampshire next door to his home state Dukakis had 
hundreds of volunteers In the South a paid staff of 64 in 15 
offices is seeking to create a new volunteer corps 
Florida with its Northeastern transplants and Jewish 
population Texas with its Hispanic vote and North Carolina with 
its concentration of high technology industries will be places 
where Dukakis campaigns hard said aide Travis 
Dukakis wife Kitty is Jewish 
The Dukakis game plan combines an emphasis on economic growth 
and opportunity with strengthening of the nations conventional 
military force 
Politically Dukakis is hoping that the credibility he gains 
from winning New Hampshire and from hopedfor good showings in the 
Minnesota caucus and South Dakota primary on Feb 22 will make up 
for any disadvantage created by his ethnic and geographic origin 
John Dukakis said his fathers Greek background and immigrant 
parents may be an initial hurdle at times in the South But he 
said People pronounce his name just fine People are looking way 
beyond that 
Bostonbased political consultant Michael Goldman said Dukakis 
campaign sources tell him the governor will spend between 3 
million and 4 million in the South to spread his message across 
such a large region And John Dukakis said the ads would begin with 
a biographical series to introduce the candidate to voters
