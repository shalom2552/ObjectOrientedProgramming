Three suspects were in jail and President 
Amin Gemayel resumed his travels Saturday one day after avoiding 
an assassination attempt when a bomb was found planted in his 
jetliner

airport employees and said they were being held in solitary 
confinement pending completion of an investigation 
A 1pound charge of TNT found under a pilots seat of the Middle 
East Airlines Boeing 707 jetline that was to leave for Larnaca 
Cyprus on Friday to carry Gemayel to Sana North Yemen The bomb 
was defused by explosives experts at Beirut airport 
Gemayel was assigned another aircraft and arrived Saturday in 
North Yemen where he was greeted by North Yemeni leader Col Ali 
Abdullah Saleh The two presidents are to discuss Lebanon and other 
Arab issues 
Gemayel 44 usually travels by military helicopter from the 
Christian heartland northeast of Beirut to Larnaca and flies from 
there to world capitals 
The Maronite Catholic has not used Beirut airport in the citys 
Moslem sector since 1984 when Moslem and leftist militias wrested 
control of west Beirut from the regular Lebanese army

by Syrian troops who were deployed in the capitals Western sector 
almost a year ago in an effort to end three years of militia 
anarchy

a sophisticated pressure fuse that would have detonated it when the 
plane reached an altitude of 30000 feet
