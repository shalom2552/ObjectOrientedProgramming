By ordinary Northern Ireland standards the six 
Roman Catholics killed by police near the end of 1982 would not 
stand out among the 2620 other people who have died during the 
20year conflict 
But the six men were unarmed and the murky circumstances of the 
police ambushes in which they died have left an ugly mystery that 
has resurfaced to batter Britains reputation for justice and fair 
play 
Critics allege that the shootings in three separate incidents 
over a threeweek period were deliberate that the policemen who 
did it escaped punishment and that a senior police officer sent in 
to investigate was hounded out of uniform because he got too close 
to the truth 
The controversy was rekindled on Jan 25 when the British 
government while denying that police mounted a shoottokill 
policy in Northern Ireland admitted in a statement that there 
had been a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice 
This admission coupled with a refusal on national security 
grounds to prosecute the killers has provoked outcry in Britain 
and Ireland and plunged relations between the two governments to 
their lowest ebb in nearly six years 
In February the investigating officer John Stalker published 
his book Stalker a portrayal of Northern Ireland as Britains 
unruly backyard where the normal rules of policing and justice are 
routinely flouted 
Critics say the book reaffirms the belief that British rule in 
Northern Ireland is unjust toward the Catholic minority and there 
are worries that the affair will set back recent progress toward 
reconciliation most notably the 1985 AngloIrish Agreement giving 
Dublin a say in governing the province 
On Nov 11 1982 three guerrilla suspects were shot dead by 
police as they drove through County Armagh A month later two more 
died in similar circumstances in the same area notorious as a 
hotbed of guerrilla activity 
In between a teenager with no guerrilla connections was killed 
in a County Armagh hayshed that served as a guerrilla explosives 
hideout having apparently stumbled innocently into a police ambush 
At first the police said all the deaths occurred in the normal 
course of antiterrorist warfare But subsequent evidence suggested 
the killings were deliberate and avoidable 
Sir John Hermon chief constable of the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary ordered an inquiry and in May 1984 Stalker the 
deputy chief constable of the Manchester police force arrived from 
the mainland with a sixman investigation team 
In his book the lean bespectacled Englishman says he was put 
on his guard from the outset when Hermon told him Remember Mr 
Stalker you are in a jungle now 
Hermon has refused repeatedly to comment on Stalkers book 
Stalker says he faced constant obstruction from a police force 
that resented him as an intruder and from Hermon who Stalker 
believes was determined to protect his beleaguered force at any 
cost 
Nonetheless after two years of investigation he felt he had 
uncovered enough to suspect the killings were the act of a 
Central American assassination squad truly of a police force out 
of control 
Stalker writes that he had evidence that at least 11 officers 
were involved in a conspiracy to pervert justice and commit perjury 
Then he says the investigation came to an end for me like a 
car hitting a brick wall In May 1986 he was abruptly dumped from 
the inquiry and suspended for disciplinary offenses 
The offenses concerned his use of police vehicles and his past 
acquaintance with people who had minor police records The panel 
that sat in judgment threw out the charges and immediately 
reinstated him 
But he was not restored to the Northern Ireland inquiry And he 
does not believe the governments insistence that his suspension 
had nothing to do with Northern Ireland 
On March 13 1987 just before his 48th birthday Stalker quit 
the force and began writing his book Partially serialized in a 
masscirculation London newspaper it has become an immediate best 
seller 
The respected Irish Times of Dublin calls it almost a morality 
play On the one side the dark violent and brutalized struggle 
between a paramilitary police force and a ruthless guerrilla 
organization On the other the honorable relentless quest for 
truth by the unarmed bobbies from Manchester 
Stalkers critics say he was naive to think he could march into 
the middle of a terrorist war and apply his English standards 
Stalker responds Im a pragmatic hardnosed copper but I draw 
the line at murder 
The Royal Ulster Constabulary has issued a statement reiterating 
that no shoottokill policy ever existed and saying it had no 
hand in Stalkers suspension 
The statement denied Stalkers investigation was obstructed and 
said there are many other matters in his book and statements 
which the police do not accept as being accurate It did not 
elaborate 
Stalker says he believes a highlevel government decision was 
taken to oust him and he says he can understand why He says he 
recognizes that if his recommendations had been taken up they 
would have devastated the police force at a delicate juncture in 
Northern Ireland politics 
He believes that there was no formal officially endorsed 
shoottokill policy but that the constabulary under constant 
attack by guerrillas was pervaded by a feeling of lets do it 
to them before they do it to us 
He also agrees with the decision not to prosecute saying too 
much time has passed for a fair trial to be held 
Stalker believes the problem lies in expecting policemen to be 
soldiers 
In Ireland where Stalker has received a heros welcome he told 
a TV interviewer It was this hypocrisy that annoyed me If 
somebody had said to me Mr Stalker these are soldiers fighting 
a war and this set of standards must apply then I could have 
taken that into account 
But they didnt They said This investigation is to be done 
in the same way as you would do in Birmingham or Liverpool and 
thats what I did
