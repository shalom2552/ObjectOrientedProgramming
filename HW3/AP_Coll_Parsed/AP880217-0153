Col JeanClaude Paul whom a Miami 
businessman called the main cocaine trafficker in Haiti runs an 
army unit that is quartered at the National Palace and known as the 
countrys most brutal 
A Western diplomat said Paul is very popular with his troops 
He likes to spread money around to them and commands them 
directly There is no normal chain of command 
The palaces latest occupant President Leslie Manigat promised 
in his inaugural speech Feb 7 to stop drug trafficking in his 
impoverished Caribbean nation 
Manigat mentioned no names and was escorted into the palace 
after the address by military guards including Paul who carried 
an Uzi submachine gun His Dessalines Battalion barracks are 
attached to the rear of the palace 
Before the inauguration Paul often served as unofficial 
bodyguard to Lt Gen Henri Namphy and Gen Williams Regala They 
were the military members on of the threeman provisional junta 
that ruled for two years after dictator JeanClaude Duvalier fled 
the country Feb 7 1986 
Paul is a stocky man of medium height about 40 who customarily 
wears a ring necklace and heavy bracelet of gold Except for his 
role as informal bodyguard for which he equips himself with an Uzi 
and holstered Colt 45 he seldom appears in public 
Osvaldo Quintana a 35yearold businessman told reporters 
Monday in Miami that he arranged a cocaine shipment with Paul 
using an airstrip on the colonels ranch to smuggle the drugs to 
Florida via the Bahamas 
He said he knew of involvement by higher Haitian officials 
extending up to the junta but would not give names 
His lawyer Ellis Rubin said he wanted Quintana to testify 
before the Senate committee investigating alleged drug smuggling by 
Gen Manuel Antonio Noriega Panamas military commander and the 
power behind his countrys government 
Rubin said his client had testified before a federal grand jury 
in Miami investigating illegal drug activity in Haiti 
Quintana said he ran a seafood operation until becoming involved 
in smuggling in August 1986 He met Paul in December of that year 
and arranged for 220 pounds of cocaine to be shipped to the United 
States the Miami man said 
We flew out of his own personal ranch in Haiti Quintana 
told the news conference 
No one in Haiti has publicly accused Paul of drug trafficking 
although rumors of his involvement are rife in diplomatic circles 
and among retired military officers 
A US diplomat would not confirm or deny reports of Pauls 
connection with drug trafficking but acknowledged the airstrip 
existed He described it as a funnylooking highway that starts 
nowhere and ends nowhere near the border with the Dominican 
Republic which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti 
Another Western diplomat said Paul owns a ranch equipped with an 
asphalt landing strip near Thomazeau about 20 miles east of 
PortauPrince He said it is believed the ranch on the CuldeSac 
Plain near the frontier once belonged to Duvalier 
All the diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity 
The 700man Dessalines Battalion largest unit in Haitis 
6000man army is also known as the most violent Men wearing the 
blue Dessalines shoulder patch killed most of the nearly 40 
civilians shot by soldiers during antigovernment strikes and 
protests in 1987 
On the day of the aborted election Nov 29 when thugs with guns 
and machetes killed at least 34 people and wounded 75 Western 
reporters and election observers saw truckloads of Dessalines 
soldiers stand by without intervening 
Gen Carl Nicolas the army chief of staff refused a request by 
The Associated Press for an interview with Paul 
Anaise Chavenet spokeswoman for the Information Ministry said 
Tuesday The government will not give an opinion on this affair 
as long as it is not officially informed by US officials 
through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
On Monday Ms Chavenet said of Paul I personally think that 
he is being singled out for attack like Noriega in Panama 
President Manigat has pledged to fight drug trafficking I dont 
know how he feels about Col Paul 
Asked during a recent interview at his home about reports of 
drug smuggling by the army Manigat said I cant base my 
judgment on rumors 
The Western diplomat who mentioned Pauls popularity with his 
men said the Dessalines Battalion is the only unit really feared 
here 
He said Duvalier created the elite 300man Leopards Battalion 
in the early 1980s to check the power of Pauls unit The Leopards 
the 100man navy the 100man air force and the 1000man 
Presidential Guard have the reputation of being more humane and 
professional 
After Duvalier fled the diplomat said Paul recruited about 100 
members of the dictators Tonton Macoute private militia which 
terrorized Haiti during 29 years of Duvalier family rule
