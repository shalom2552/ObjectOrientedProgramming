A new diseaseresistant iceberg lettuce 
Autumn Gold may be on the market within a year the Agriculture 
Department said Tuesday 
According to developer Edward J Ryder a USDA scientist at 
Salinas Calif Autumn Gold resists mosaic virus which causes 
lettuce plants to have small distorted heads and unhealthylooking 
dark and light green patterns 
The virus is spread through lettuce fields by green peach 
aphids which use needlelike mouth parts to pierce a leaf and suck 
its juices 
Growers will find the variety ideal for November and December 
harvest in the San Joaquin Palo Verde and Imperial valleys of 
California and the desert farmlands of Arizona Ryder said in a 
statement issued in Washington 
Most of the nations winter lettuce comes from those areas 
Paul T Orsetti president of Brinker Orsetti Seed Co Inc 
Watsonville Calif said results from trials of Autumn Gold in 
California and Arizona seem to be very promising so we are 
optimistic about the variety
