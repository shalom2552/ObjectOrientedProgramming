Nine out of 10 American hospitals have policies 
restricting smoking and a growing number are banning smoking from 
their premises entirely according to a study released Wednesday 
More than half the surveyed hospitals that restrict or ban 
smoking said they had a moral responsibility to do so according to 
Stuart A Wesbury Jr president of the Chicagobased American 
College of Healthcare Executives 
Healthcare executives are taking seriously their role in 
promoting wellness Wesbury said at a news conference where he 
released results of the colleges survey of 770 hospitals 
The number of respondents who report they have banned smoking 
is extremely impressive when one considers the nature of a 
hospital Wesbury said Its not easy to simply say no 
smoking with the number of people many of them under tremendous 
stress who use the facility each day as patients or visitors 
Of the 90 percent of respondents with smoking policies in effect 
last year 8 percent had outright bans on smoking by employees 
physicians patients and visitors the college found 
In 1981 a survey of more than 3000 hospitals by the American 
Hospital Association found maybe one or two in the country with 
outright bans on smoking said Lynn Jones manager of 
worksitehealth promotion for that Chicagobased organization 
Typical of those with smoking bans is St Cloud Hospital of St 
Cloud Minn a 489bed hospital that banned smoking last November 
Sister Paul Revier organizer of its smokefree policy said 
exceptions are made for patients in the hospitals 
chemicaldependency and psychiatric wards and for patients who 
obtain written permission to smoke from a doctor 
Fewer than 10 such physician orders have been written since the 
policy went into effect she said 
There had been no problems with employee smoking Sister Paul 
said adding she did not expect any to arise The hospital offered 
its employees educational programs and stopsmoking classes for a 
year before the ban began she said 
People are in a sense embarrassed to smoke among other 
employees she said 
John Frobenius the hospital president said St Clouds 
smokefree policy had created less of a stir than he had expected 
although he said one woman chose to have her baby at another 
hospital rather than give up smoking during her stay 
The University of Chicago Medical Center will go smokefree on 
April 1 said Kenneth Bloem executive vice president of the 
654bed complex which includes three hospitals and 100 outpatient 
clinics 
This is the second phase of a longterm policy to eliminate 
smoking from the center altogether Bloem said 
We have looked at smoking as a major publichealth problem and 
see this as an opportunity for our institutions to promote the 
health of patients staff and visitors as well as maintaining the 
health of our patients he said
