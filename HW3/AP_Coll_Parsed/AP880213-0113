Killer bees from South America will probably begin 
swarming into the United States in the next year or two and any 
attempt to head them off at the border is likely to fail experts 
predicted Saturday 
The nasty aggressive bees have already reached southern Mexico 
and are winging northward at a rate of 200 or 300 miles a year One 
authority said they might even hit Brownsville Texas late this 
year 
US and Mexican officials have set up a BRZ or bee regulated 
zone in southern Mexico in an effort to at least slow down the 
intruders 
However experts at a conference of the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science said Saturday that the arrival of the 
Africanized bees is inevitable although they are not sure how far 
north the bees will spread Some believe they will be limited to 
the warm southern states while others say they might spread over 
much of the nation 
In my view to eradicate a social insect is almost 
impossible said David W Roubik a staff scientist with the 
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Balboa Panama 
Its too hard to get every last one he said Any mass 
eradication program would be a filter I dont see any possibility 
of ridding the Americas of Africanized bees 
The bees descended from South African bees that escaped from a 
researcher in Brazil in 1956 In South and Central America they 
have largely displaced their gentler cousins descended from 
European bees 
Unlike ordinary honeybees the Africanized variety is easily 
riled and hundreds may attack unsuspecting intruders who go near 
their nests leading to the popular name killer bees They 
sometimes kill animals and people with their stings 
The Africanized bees are thought to be a major threat to the 
US beekeeping industry Commercially maintained bees are 
important for pollinating crops ranging from almonds to 
blueberries and the Africanized bees are poor pollinators 
Killer bees frequently take over commercial hives where they 
are difficult to handle They are poor honey makers and they 
frequently pack up and fly off without warning 
In a report prepared for the meeting Orley R Taylor of the 
University of Kansas predicted the arrival of the bees in Texas 
later this year He said the bees will clearly have an impact in 
the United States but whether it will be in the billions of 
dollars or only in the tens of millions over the next 20 years is 
not yet clear 
An effort to halt the bees at the narrowest point in Mexico the 
Isthmus of Tehuantepec already shows signs of failing Officials 
hoping to trap and kill the bees in a belt across the isthmus have 
already had to fall back to a second line of defense 
Like several other experts scheduled to speak at the meeting Al 
Dietz of the University of Georgia was not able to attend because 
of bad weather in Boston but his research report was read to the 
conference 
He said the bees were able to survive as successfully as 
European bees in the cold mountains of Argentina even when covered 
with snow for a month He said they might survive in the United 
States south of the 40 degree latitude which crosses the country 
from Philadelphia to Denver to northern California 
Suzanne WT Batra of the US Department of Agriculture said 
she believes they will thrive along the coasts as far north as 
Washington state and Boston but live only in the southern states in 
the nations interior 
Roubik said that the Africanized bees may need tropical flowers 
and nestuilding materials and this could stop them from getting 
established in colder parts of the United States 
David JC Fletcher of Bucknell University said in a report that 
bees in Africa are more gentle make more honey and are easier to 
control than their Africanized descendents in the Americas He 
proposed bringing friendly bees from Africa to the United States 
and letting them breed with the killer bees so they will pass on 
their desirable traits 
However it is currently illegal to bring live honeybees into 
the United States Efforts to crossbreed killer bees with European 
honeybees have proven unsuccessful because the Africanized bees are 
genetically dominant
