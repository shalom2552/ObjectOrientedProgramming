President Reagan on Thursday proposed a 294 
billion military budget that would reduce activeduty forces and 
kill cherished weapons programs to comply with a congressional 
freeze on his ambitious arms buildup 
For the first time in a presidency that had earmarked 2 
trillion for defense Reagan proposed significant cuts to American 
troop strength a drop of 34000 men and women or 156 percent He 
postponed perhaps killed such longstanding goals as providing the 
Navy a 600ship fleet 
He called for retiring hundreds of helicopters and more than a 
dozen ships sooner than expected urged Congress to give up on 
development of the mobile Midgetman nuclear missile and abandoned 
the ASAT satellitekilling rocket Navy blimps Army drones and Air 
Force spy planes also fell victim to his budget ax 
All told Reagan asked for budget authority totaling 2995 
billion for military programs of which 294 billion would actually 
be paid out during the year starting Oct 1 
The fiscal 1989 totals represented increases from the 2914 
billion in budget authority and 2854 billion in outlays set for 
this year but not enough to compensate for inflation the 
president said 
Unlike past years the administration already had agreed with 
Congress on the totals for military spending That was done last 
November in a deal to reduce the national deficit when the White 
House agreed to accept 2995 billion in budget authority instead 
of the 3324 billion it really wanted 
Unveiled Thursday then were the details of how the 
administration had scaled back to reach the new targets Defense 
Secretary Frank C Carlucci described the changes as painful and 
risky but done to a clear set of priorities that emphasized 
quality over quantity 
Weve made the hard choices here he said at a Pentagon 
briefing We have traded off a smaller force in order to maintain 
a quality force 
To illustrate what he meant Carlucci cited a request to provide 
military personnel a 43 percent pay raise next year instead of the 
2 percent planned for civilian workers a small increase in 
spending for operations and maintenance to ensure adequate training 
and deployment schedules and continued production of existing 
modern weapons such as the M1A1 tank and the AH64 Apache 
helicopter 
In dividing up the 261 percent of federal outlays that would go 
to defense in fiscal 1989 Carlucci said the administration would 
not abandon certain longstanding priorities 
For example the Pentagon wants 455 billion for the Star Wars 
missile defense system compared with 355 billion this year An 
additional 402 million is being sought for Energy Department work 
on Star Wars 
The Pentagon is also asking to continue work on a railmobile 
version of the MX missile and is requesting 14 billion for 
another Trident nuclear submarine Carlucci said 
On the other hand the combined activeduty roster of the Army 
Navy Air Force and Marine Corps will be reduced gradually this 
year from 2172000 to 2138000 and then held at that level 
throughout fiscal 1989 Carlucci said 
The Air Force will be hit the hardest giving up about 23000 
jobs toward the total 34000 being cut 
The Army will deactivate a motorized infantry brigade at Fort 
Lewis Wash and cancel the scheduled activation of two light 
infantry battalions in Alaska The Navy will scrap plans to 
establish a 14th air wing at the Miramar Calif Naval Air Station 
and retire 16 frigates and one submarine it wanted to keep The Air 
Force will deactivate two fighter wings and start deactivating a 
third 
In other moves Carlucci and Pentagon comptroller Robert Helm 
said

The Army will retire 450 Vietnamera utility helicopters and 
170 scout copters cancel the Aquila surveillance drone program and 
stop production of Copperhead laserguided artillery shells cancel 
development of the AntiTactical Missile and develop only one new 
light helicopter instead of two 
The Navy will give up its goal of reaching a 600ship fleet in 
fiscal 1989 settling for 580 If Congress and the next 
administration agree the Navy might hit the 600ship level in 
fiscal 1992 The Navy also will kill its new blimp program and 
cancel development of a new model of the Intruder attack jet the 
A6F 
The Air Force will deactivate the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing 
at Nellis Air Force Base and one other either the 401st Air Wing 
now in Spain or another one if a new European home is found for the 
401st It will reduce its operation of SR71 surveillance jets 
relying more on satellites cancel development of the ASAT 
satellitekiller rocket and place the space shuttle launch section 
of Vandenberg Air Force Base into mothball status 
Carlucci said he was recommending to Congress that it kill 
development of the singlewarhead Midgetman nuclear missile but 
was requesting 200 million for the program next year to keep the 
missile alive long enough for the next administration to decide its 
fate 
Because of the budget environment Carlucci said he had directed 
the services to change their planning guidelines for the four years 
after fiscal 1989 to assume afterinflation increases of 2 percent 
instead of 3 percent 
Such growth will be the minimum necessary to reverse four years 
of lowerthaninflation increases he said
