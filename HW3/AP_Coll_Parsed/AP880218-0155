An anencephalic baby kept on lifesupport systems to preserve 
his organs for transplant died this morning in California and a 
3weekold boy too weak to undergo a second heart transplant died 
in a Pittsburgh hospital 
The anencephalic baby has been declared dead said Dick 
Schaefer spokesman for Loma Linda University Medical Center in 
Loma Linda Calif 
He refused to immediately say whether the boys organs were in 
suitable condition for transplants 
The unidentified boy who was born with most of his brain 
missing had been on a respirator at the hospital 60 miles east of 
Los Angeles said spokeswoman Anita Rockwell He was born Tuesday 
in Anaheim she said 
Most babies born with anencephaly die within days Their healthy 
organs can be transplanted if organ damage is prevented by 
maintaining the infants on lifesupport 
No cases of anencephalics being kept on lifesupport have been 
announced in the United States although Leonard Bailey chief of 
Loma Lindas heart transplant program last year suggested there 
have been such infants 
At Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh Johnathan Stowe died 
Wednesday afternoon still attached to the heartlungs bypass 
machine on which doctors had placed him after surgery said Lynn 
McMahon hospital spokeswoman 
His parents David and Tabitha Stowe of Beaver Falls were with 
him Johnathan received a new heart Monday The left side of his 
own heart was underdeveloped at his birth Jan 25 
Doctors said the cause of death was failure of the donor heart 
The organ had come from an infant close in age and size to 
Johnathan who was 76 pounds at birth Ms McMahon said 
It really is perplexing for the surgeons she said The 
match with the donor organ was very good The surgery itself 
proceeded very well But for some unknown reason immediately after 
surgery the heart began to weaken 
Johnathan was placed on the bypass machine following the 
transplant in hopes the donor organ could rest and gain strength 
Ms McMahon said Doctors on Monday gave him a 10 percent chance to 
survive and he developed complications with his lungs and kidneys 
the next day 
Johnathan never gained consciousness following the transplant 
Ms McMahon said A second transplant was not considered because 
doctors felt his system couldnt withstand another surgery she 
said 
In California Loma Linda had maintained the infant on 
lifesupport under guidelines developed last year after a woman 
pregnant with an anencephalic baby waged a nationwide campaign to 
find a hospital that would consent to keep her child on 
lifesupport until the organs could be donated But that baby was 
stillborn 
One of the hospitals 13 heart transplant patients under age 4 
received the heart of an anencephalic baby but the donor child was 
in Canada 
An infant who received a heart transplant at Loma Linda on 
Sunday remained in serious but stable condition The boy was born 
with a fatal heart defect
