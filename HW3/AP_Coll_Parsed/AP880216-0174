A United Nations official appealed to 
Christian and Moslem leaders Tuesday to help win the release of two 
Scandinavian relief workers who were kidnapped in southern Lebanon 
11 days ago 
Also Tuesday the United States condemned an assassination 
attempt against Lebanese President Amin Gemayel 
UN UndersecretaryGeneral Marrack Goulding flew to Beirut from 
Tunisia and went straight to a meeting with Lebanese Foreign 
Ministry Undersecretary Fuad Turk in Christian east Beirut 
I asked ambassador Turk to work for the Scandinavians 
release as soon as possible Goulding told reporters after the 
meeting 
The two captives Jan Stening 44 of Sweden and William 
Jorgensen 58 of Norway served with the United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency which cares for Palestinian refugees They were 
grabbed on Feb 5 near the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon 
The agency has blamed the abductions on Palestinians acting 
individually and without political motivation or links to any 
organization 
After meeting with Turk Goulding crossed Beiruts dividing 
Green Line to the Moslem sector where he held an hourlong meeting 
with Sunni Moslem acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss at his home 
Goulding told reporters afterward the two had discussed the 
Lebanese situation in general as well as this very serious 
problem of the two kidnapped UNRWA officials 
Asked if there had been any progress in efforts to free the 
captives Goulding said No It remains a puzzling difficult and 
worrying case 
Im indeed hopeful Goulding said I cant say that the 
release will be tomorrow but I think its very important for the 
Arab cause the Palestinian cause and for the Lebanese cause that 
they should be released as soon as possible 
Goulding said that during a visit to Tunis last weekend he urged 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chief Yasser Arafat to work 
toward the release of the Scandinavian captives 
Arafat had earlier ordered his PLO commanders in southern 
Lebanon to spare no effort in winning their release 
Goulding also met with Shiite Moslem parliament speaker Hussein 
Husseini 
In Washington a State Department statement called the attempted 
assasination of Gemayel on Friday a reprehensible act and 
condemned those responsible 
The government of Lebanon continues to have our full 
support the US statement said 
Three Beirut airport employees were jailed after police found a 
bombed beneath the pilots seat on a jetliner that was to take 
Gemayel 44 from the Lebanese capital to Cyprus 
Assassinations car bombings and kidnappings have plagued 
Lebanon since a civil war broke out in 1975 An estimated 130000 
people have died in the violence
