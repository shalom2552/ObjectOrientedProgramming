An American destroyer wary of another 
Starktype attack fired flares at an Iraqi bomber racing toward a 
convoy of USflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf US 
military officials said Saturday 
The plane a Sovietbuilt Tu16 Badger veered sharply away from 
the convoy just before it launched two missiles Friday night The 
missiles exploded in a flash on the horizon a minute or so later 
according to journalists aboard the destroyer Chandler 
On May 17 two Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi F1 Mirage hit 
the missile frigate USS Stark killing 37 US sailors Iraq said 
the attack was a mistake 
Fridays incident was the second time in five days that an Iraqi 
aircraft on a raid against Iranian targets had come within eight 
miles of a US warship in the central gulf as it prepared to fire 
its missiles 
US military sources said officers aboard the battle cruiser 
Richmond K Turner had a tense moment last Sunday night when 
they thought an Iraqi missile had been fired at their ship That 
missile also launched from a Badger bomber was visible when fired 
and when it exploded said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
There was no word on what the Fridays projectiles actually hit 
but Iraq announced it had carried out an air strike against two 
large maritime targets near Iranheld Sirri island at 908 pm 
the same time as the Chandlers sighting 
Sirri is a littleused oil terminal about 60 miles northwest of 
Dubai and 40 miles from the Iran coast There was no other 
verification of the claimed attack 
Cmdr Steve Smith skipper of the 8300ton Chandler told 
members of the Pentagonorganized news pool that Iraqi pilots often 
fire at radar blips without being sure of what they are 
Having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time I 
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was 
heading toward us he informed his crew by ships intercom 
Many US officers sailing the gulf say their greatest single 
concern is an errant Iraqi air attack such as that which 
devastated the Stark 
Iraq later apologized for the attack and agreed to pay 
compensation to the US government and the victims families The 
State Department said recently it was in the final stages of 
preparing claims 
The Chandler was one of two warships escorting the upbound 
convoy which included four of the 11 stateowned Kuwaiti tankers 
reregistered under the Stars and Stripes last year for protection 
from Iranian attack Iran considers Kuwait an ally of Iraq in their 
sevenyear war 
US warships routinely go on top alert when Iraqi warplanes 
show up on radar and the Chandlers crew was at general 
quarters or battle stations as the Badger was tracked down the 
gulf and looped eastward toward its target 
The ships Phalanx gun designed to hurl a storm of radarguided 
shells at an incoming cruise missile was on automatic and its own 
missiles and Stinger antiaircraft teams were ready to fire 
As the Iraqi jet turned behind the convoy and appeared to head 
for the trailing Chandler the destroyer fired two flares from a 
5inch gun and radioed the pilot to change course Smith said the 
pilot spoke poor English and did not seem to understand but veered 
away immediately when the flares lit up 
Smith said it was the closest an Iraqi plane had come to the 
Chandler since its arrival Nov 25 The ship originally built for 
the Iranian navy but never delivered is specially equipped to 
monitor air activity 
The skipper also said the Iraqi Badger a twinengine jet 
bomber carried Chinesemade C601 missiles rather than the 
Frenchbuilt Exocets normally used by Baghdads air forces 
It was apparently the first disclosure that Iraq uses the C601 
an airtoground version of the Silkworm antiship missile that 
China has furnished to Iran The basic design is Soviet and more 
than 30 years old 
Meanwhile a Danish supertanker crippled in a mysterious attack 
on Thursday continued under tow to a shipyard outside the gulf 
Gulf shipping executives and military sources in the United 
States said there were indications that the 339000ton ship was 
hit by an Iraqi missile rather than an Iranian helicopter as 
first reported 
One seaman was killed and three others injured in the attack on 
the tanker Kate Maersk which was badly damaged by fire 
The US sources speaking on condition of anonymity said there 
was no helicopter in the vicinity but noted that Iraq had claimed 
an air raid on a large naval target about the time of the 
attack 
Salvage officials also speaking privately said the tanker had 
what one called a gigantic entry hole in its superstructure 
suggesting a hit by a large Exocettype missile 
Officials of AP Moeller the ships Copenhagenbased owners 
said they could not comment on what may have hit the tanker
