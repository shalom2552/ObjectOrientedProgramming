Eastern Airlines has corrected many of the 
safety problems that led to a 95 million fine two year ago but a 
small airline Eastern is enlisting to combat a possible strike 
faces safety penalties of its own the Federal Aviation 
Administration disclosed Tuesday 
The separate FAA findings surfaced as Easterns safety record 
came under renewed scrutiny at a congressional hearing where 
Eastern pilots at times laughed derisively at some of the 
assurances on safety made by Eastern executives 
Eastern has been in the midst of labor problems for months with 
charges by the unions that Easterns management is cutting corners 
on safety The 10000member machinists union has been locked in 
talks under a federal mediator and Easterns 4000 pilots have not 
said whether they would work if the machinists went on strike 
Thomas J Matthews Sr ake by mechanics Eastern might be 
forced out of business Eastern has lost 900 million since 1978 
including 1817 million last year 
Two years ago Eastern was fined a record 95 million by the FAA 
for a broad range of maintenance and recordkeeping violations In 
a followup report on the airline since the fine the FAA said 
Tuesday that while many of the maintenance problems appear to have 
been resolved some concerns persist 
A threemonth review of Eastern that ended last November shows 
substantial progress has been made Anthony Broderick the FAAs 
associate administrator for aviation standards said in a statement 
accompanying the report 
However there are areas that need attention including 
maintenance procecures that identify repeated failures of the same 
item he said 
Broderick also said that Eastern still must reduce the number of 
postponed maintenance items carried over from day to day on 
aircraft And the FAA report noted that while Easterns management 
has improved manuals operating specifiations and maintenance 
inspection procedures agency inspectors could not say for certain 
if Eastern is now complying with its own program and 
procedures 
Eastern in a statement from its Miami headquarters noted that 
the FAA report shows Eastern has take action to deal with 52 of the 
53 areas of concern cited two years The airline said the FAAs 
latest review reflects attempts by the carrier to correct past 
problems 
Over the past two years Eastern has concentrated on upgrading 
the quality of its flight and maintenance performance Phil 
Bakes Easterns president and chief executive officer said in a 
statement 
But a separate FAA report prompted questions among some members 
of Congress about Easterns recently announced plans in event of a 
strike at the Miamibased airline 
Eastern recently said it was leasing 26 of its jetliners to 
Orion Air Lift Services Inc a cargo carrier based in Raleigh 
NC and that in event of a strike Orion would fly some of 
Easterns routes using its own personnel 
But a report issued by the FAA on Monday cast doubts on Orions 
safety record The agency disclosed that it is preparing to take 
enforcement action including a civil penalty against Orion for 
past safety infractions 
Government scrutiny of Orion documented a large number of 
serious safety infractions including systematic difficulties 
with the use of operating and maintenance handbooks and training 
programs said Broderick the FAA official 
The infractions found at Orion are being corrected to prevent 
similar occurrences in the future and the corrections permit 
Orion to safely operate its cargo business said Broderick in a 
statment although not specifically addressing the question of 
whether Orion would be permitted to operate scheduled passenger 
service 
The FAA must approve such authority 
During the hearings on Captitol Hill Eastern was accused of 
using Orion to break a possible strike 
On the basis of the FAA report Rep Cardiss Collins DIll 
chairwoman of the subcommittee characterized Orion as an airline 
in near shambles including problems with pilots and mechanics 
training maintenance records and management 
James L Heffernan an Orion vice president told the 
subcommittee that virtually all of the problems cited by the FAA 
have been corrected
