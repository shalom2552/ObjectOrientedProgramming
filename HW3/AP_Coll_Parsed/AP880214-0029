Some youth gangs are taking a 
corporate approach to selling drugs complete with accounting and 
marketing divisions and bonuses for top salesmen according to 
Michigan State University researchers 
This is a street version of Wall Street Its straight out of 
any graduate school of business said Carl Taylor an adjunct 
professor of criminal justice and one of five researchers in a 
fiveyear study on gangs 
He cited as an example Richard White Boy Rick Wershe Jr 
who recently was sentenced to life in prison for selling cocaine in 
Detroit 
Kids are still talking about his trappings and how he was 
rolling In the halls of Denby High School hes a legend Taylor 
said last week 
Taylor and his associates studied gangs in three cities 
including two corporate bands of hoods in Detroit where the 
study was focused 
The researchers interviewed gang members on street corners and 
in nightclubs aided by a researcher who was a former gang member 
They found that in the corporate gangs some members would be 
assigned to marketing checking out neighborhoods to assess 
potential sales and what competition if any existed 
They would report back to gang leaders who would decide whether 
to enter that market 
Other members were assigned to do the actual selling If they 
did well they could be promoted to distributor and put in control 
of larger amounts of drugs Distributors also were responsible for 
keeping books 
Like companies in search of excellence gang leaders would 
reward top salesmen with bonuses such as cars trips money and 
clothing 
With the new corporate entity they will do anything to 
further and protect their goals Taylor said Its the in 
thing to be a White Boy Rick or Young Boys Incorporated That role 
model has replaced Cub Scouts Boy Scouts and pro athletes The 
ramifications are so deep its scary 
Detroit police say Taylors thesis has some merit but that 
corporate gangs are not that widespread 
More and more of these operations are operating like 
businesses said narcotics inspector Warren Harris These 
things are planned for and these things are wellarranged Its 
almost as if theyve had professional guidance 
He said older adults are usually the top leaders of drug 
organizations and the number of youths running such operations has 
declined since the days of Young Boys Inc a notorious Detroit 
drug ring that operated in the 1970s And he said the 
organizations do not always evolve from gangs 
Harris speculated that young criminals ability to structure a 
drug business may come from watching how the legal system operates 
or taking advice from attorneys and other professionals 
As efficient as corporate gangs might appear there is no 
dominant drug distributor in the Detroit area police say 
Detroits problems are shared nationwide and extend from the 
inner cities to wealthy suburbs Taylor said adding that the 
greatest threats to corporate gangs are crackdowns capitalism and 
relatively inexpensive crack cocaine 
Big activity by a corporate gang often prompts big interest from 
the government including the Internal Revenue Service Taylor 
said and the combined forces of the government can bring down a 
gang 
But crack can bring about the breakdown first The drug far 
cheaper than powder cocaine has inspired many young entrepreneurs 
to split off from their corporate gangs and head out on their own 
Its their version of the American dream Taylor said
