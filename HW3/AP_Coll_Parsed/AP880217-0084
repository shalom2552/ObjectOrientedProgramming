Legislation prohibiting local governments from 
promoting homosexuality is virtually certain to become law after 
the House of Lords defeated an amendment that would have limited 
the measure to stateowned schools 
The Lords the unelected upper chamber of Parliament voted 
9048 on Tuesday night to defeat the amendment 
The restriction on promoting homosexuality is included in a 
legislative package proposed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers 
Conservative administration 
The vote represented the legislations last parliamentary hurdle 
and the package has been penciled in for entry onto the statute 
books on June 1 The package only needs to complete a formal final 
reading in Parliament for it to become law 
The bill stipulate that local authorities which run public 
libraries some theaters and most state schools must not 
intentionally promote homosexuality Authorities that defy the 
ban can be sued by individuals or penalized by auditors for 
misusing funds according to the legislation 
The amendment defeated by the House of Lords sought to limit the 
ban on promoting homosexuality to one area only stateowned 
schools 
A Labor Party member Lord Willis also tried to include wording 
saying the proposed law is not a license to discriminate against 
homosexuals but his effort failed when the time allotted for 
debate ran out 
Arguing for the measure Home Office Minister Lord Caithness 
said gay pride programs and the promotion of gay rights in 
youth clubs run by some local authorities sought to glamorize 
homosexuality 
Young people are susceptible to these intolerable influences 
Activities such as a Lesbian Gay Strength and Pride Week are in 
the governments view at least as likely to glamorize 
homosexuality in the minds of impressionable young people as 
anything a teacher might do he said 
Lord Longford of the socialist opposition Labor Party told the 
House of Lords the measure smacked of a general queerbashing 
campaign 
Mrs Thatcher complained last fall that children were being 
taught they have an inalienable right to be gay Her government 
has accused some leftwing local authorities of using state funds 
to promote homosexuality 
Leftist local governments including those running inner city 
London and the northern cities of Manchester and Sheffield have 
been criticized by conservative newspapers in Britain for giving 
grants to gay and lesbian community groups 
The government also has acted to curb spending by local 
authorities and plans shortly to introduce controls on what is 
taught in stateowned schools whose daytoday running is in the 
hands of local government 
Critics said the homosexuality measure known as Clause 28 was 
a setback for gay rights in Britain and a swing toward 
authoritanian rule by Mrs Thatcher and her government Walls in 
London and other cities were covered with slogans attacking Clause 
28 as repressive legislation 
Some critics of the measure also said the word promote is so 
vague it could allow local authorities to censor works by EM 
Forster and other famous homosexual writers in public libraries and 
theaters 
The government has denied prejudice and dismissed that criticism 
Homosexual acts in private between consenting civilian males who 
are at least 21 years old were legalized by the Sexual Offenses Act 
in 1967 although the age limit is widely ignored by Britains gay 
community 
Homosexuality between males in the armed forces is outlawed 
For centuries until 1836 the death penalty was used to deter 
sodomy in Britain Until 1967 it was punishable by imprisonment 
Oscar Wilde the homosexual Irishborn playwright was sentenced 
to two years imprisonment with hard labor in 1895 and until the 
passing of the 1967 act male homosexuals lived in constant fear of 
blackmail The 1967 act referred only to males as British law has 
never banned lesbianism
