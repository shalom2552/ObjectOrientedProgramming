A quickthinking 12yearold boy used 
his thumb a wad of bubble gum and a sock to plug a gas leak after 
the toddler he was babysitting pedaled a toy fire engine into the 
pipe 
Jim Bliemeister was taking care of 3yearold David Higgins on 
Saturday at the Higgins home when the incident occurred 
David was playing in the basement said Jim Hes the kind 
of kid who likes to jump around a lot and he just pedaled his fire 
engine into the gas line 
Jim said he heard hissing from the pipe 
Then I smelled the gas and said David get upstairs and get 
me that gum on your dresser Then I just waited with my thumb in 
the hole in the line 
David didnt understand at first First he brought me Baby 
Wipes Then he brought me some of his toy cars I was getting 
worried But then he came through he brought me the gum 
I chewed it really fast then I stuffed it into the leak It 
was a little smaller than the size of a dime but it was making 
noise And then I tied the whole thing with a sock There were 
dirty clothes right by and the hot water heater 
Jim then called his father James who arrived just before 
Davids mother Judy who promptly called National Fuel 
A guy came almost right away Jim said He said I did the 
right thing and he seemed very surprised that Id sealed it all up 
myself But I didnt know that I just did it He said that if Id 
waited the whole house could have blown up 
Arthur K Coon spokesman for National Fuel concurred Sunday 
saying The boy responded in a responsible way What he did was 
not what wed recommend anyone doing himself But the situation was 
potentially very dangerous and he took care of it
