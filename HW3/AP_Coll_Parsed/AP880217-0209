Union leaders uncertain which 
presidential candidate their members like but unwilling to accept 
Sen Albert Gore Jr are hoping to prevent the Tennessean from 
upstaging the other Democrats in the Super Tuesday round of 
primaries in three weeks 
Although Gore carries an 88 percent proAFLCIO lifetime voting 
record unusually high for a Southern Democrat and ahead of Rep 
Richard A Gephardts 83 percent prolabor record some union 
political directors say they are having trouble slating members as 
Gore delegates to the Democratic national convention 
Gore has just 85 union members running as delegates to the 
convention next July in Atlanta from the eight states whose filing 
deadlines have passed compared with 255 for Sen Paul Simon of 
Illinois according to information provided by six presidential 
campaigns to the AFLCIO 
Labor delegate totals for the the other five Democratic 
candidates from all eight states were incomplete but the figures 
that were available indicated that Gephardt and Massachusetts Gov 
Michael Dukakis were slating trade unionists in about equal numbers 
with Simon except in the South where Jesse Jackson appeared 
strongest 
More laborites want to be Gore delegates but his campaign is 
the only one that is actively shunning their support according to 
some union political directors 
Hes not going after labor at all complained Rachelle 
Horowitz political director for the American Federation of 
Teachers The people he has running his campaign are 1976 Jimmy 
Carter types Theyre not slating labor people 
Ms Horowitz who openly favors Dukakis and is one of 42 
automatic labor delegates to the convention as members of the 
Democratic National Committee is counting on Jackson to win 
between four and six of the 20 primaries and caucuses on March 8 to 
thwart Gores Southern strategy 
Labor leaders here are counting on Jacksons strong showing in 
the South to keep Gore out of first or third place in the 
postSuper Tuesday delegate counts and throw the race into the 
industrial state contests in Illinois Michigan New York 
Pennsylvania and Ohio where unions are strongest 
As a trade unionist of course Id rather see it decided in 
the industrial states said Robert A Georgine president of the 
federations 4million member Building and Construction Trades 
Department 
AFLCIO President Lane Kirkland said Wednesday he can still call 
the 91 presidents of the federations member unions together to 
make a preconvention endorsement if it appears any one candidate 
is beginning to garner overwhelming support among union members 
The essential criteria is the same at least a twothirds 
consensus he said But Im not going to force it and Im not 
going to invent it either 
While acknowledging their personal favorites most union 
presidents on the federations 36member policymaking executive 
council said none of the candidates has yet to muster that kind of 
support among their members 
William Wynn president of the United Food and Commercial 
Workers Union the AFLCIOs third largest with 1 million members 
doubts there will be an endorsement 
We cant change the fact that no individual has emerged he 
said Our Iowa locals got together and endorsed Dukakis but it 
wasnt a very strong endorsement I would bet that Jesse Jackson 
got a lot of UFCW votes in Iowa 
The AFLCIOs early endorsement of Walter Mondale in 1984 helped 
save his campaign after he lost the New Hampshire primary that year 
to Gary Hart of Colorado But it also enabled Mondales opponents 
to tag labor as a special interest candidate and created a 
backlash among many union members 
Exit polls showed only about half the voters from union 
households pulled the lever for Mondale in the general election 
far short of the twothirds majority support that the AFLCIO 
claimed that its endorsement represented Union leaders here are 
intent on avoiding a repeat of that 
Were damned if we do and damned if we dont said Richard 
Kilroy president of the Transporation Communications Union and 
head of a coalition of 15 rail unions We may well go into a 
brokered convention and thats not a bad thing as far as were 
concerned Obviously the best thing to do is not force a 
consensus
