Socialist Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said 
Sunday he would consider resigning if the controversy over 
President Kurt Waldheims World War II conduct continues to hamper 
Vranitzkys leadership 
About 5000 people including actor Klaus Maria Brandauer 
gathered in central Vienna outside the landmark St Stephens 
Cathedral to call for Waldheims ouster 
About half of them marched to the Hofburg Palace which 
accommodates the presidents office and chanted Waldheim must 
go 
In an hourlong television interview Vranitzky who heads a 
coalition government launched a sharp attack on Waldheim whose 
duties as head of state are mostly ceremonial 
The president did not deal exactly with the truth during the 
investigation into his activities as a soldier in the Nazi army 
Vranitzky said He stopped short however of urging Waldheim to 
step down 
Veteran political observers did not recall a similar public 
confrontation between a chancellor and a president since the second 
Austrian republic was established after World War II 
The Vienna government appointed a historians commission to 
investigate Waldheims wartime record last year after the US 
government put the former UN secretary general on a watchlist 
of undesirable aliens US officials said Waldheim was a 
lieutenant in a German unit that sent thousands of Jews to Nazi 
death camps 
The historians released their report Monday 
The 202page document established Waldheims close proximity 
to wartime atrocities in the Balkans and seriously questioned his 
integrity as a German army officer 
The tabloid Kurier published on Sunday an interview in which 
Waldheim said he has no plans to resign because he enjoys the 
support of a great and silent majority 
I feel the group who makes the demand that I should resign is 
relatively small compared to those who want me to stay in office 
the president was quoted as saying 
In a comment published in early Monday editions of the Kurier 
Waldheim was quoted as saying he continues to be interested in a 
constructive relationship with the federal chancellor 
But Vranitzky when asked how Austria could emerge from a 
situation in which the country faces a bad image abroad and 
division at home said We must try to get out of this situation 
by not satisfying ourselves with allowing the president not to face 
up to these things 
Vranitzky said it was not enough for the president to give 
newspaper interviews because interviews dont replace the 
questionandanswer game in a democracy 
He warned that if his expectations about the presidents conduct 
are not fulfilled and if a high percentage of his time continues to 
be absorbed by the Waldheim affair then the question arises if I 
can carry on this government post 
The Socialists are the senior partner in the coalition with the 
conservative Austrian Peoples Party which backed Waldheim when he 
won his sixyear term in 1986 
Heinrich Keller a chief Socialist secretary reported Saturday 
that for the first time a majority of party members now want 
Waldheim to resign 
Also on Saturday Vranitzky told Austrian radio that mere 
noninvolvement in war crimes did not qualify one to be Austrias 
president 
Vranitzky continued his criticism Sunday by seriously 
questioning Waldheims ability to perform his duties 
The federal president must be an integration figure not a 
disintegration figure he said 
Vranitzky also criticized Waldheim and his advisers for trying 
to portray the attacks on the president as something orchestrated 
by Jews and foreigners 
On Friday former Foreign Minister Karl Gruber stirred outrage 
by claiming that members of the commission were Waldheims enemies 
because they were either socialists or Jews 
Meanwhile the Swiss military historian who led the historians 
commission said Sunday he sensed that the Austrian president felt a 
certain moral culpability for war crimes committed while he 
served in the German army 
Hans Rudolf Kurz in an interview on Swiss radio said he asked 
Waldheim why two biographies do not mention his wartime past 
Waldheim replied I did much more important things Kurz 
said 
But the better response would have been I was hesitant to 
talk about it he said in the Frenchlanguage interview I am 
not saying he is guilty of war crimes But he feels a certain moral 
culpability It disturbs him
