Major US banks arent expected to participate in 
Mexicos innovative debtreduction plan an American banker said 
Friday 
A senior official at Swiss Bank Corp however said his bank 
will tender some of its loans 
The bankers made their comments at a London conference on Latin 
America organized by the International Herald Tribune and the 
InterAmerican Development Bank 
Under the program the Mexican government plans to exchange some 
of the debt it owes foreign commercial banks for new 20year bonds 
that will be issued by the government and backed by US Treasury 
bonds 
Mexican officials have indicated they expect to retire 20 
billion of debt through the 10 billion bond issue The country has 
1056 billion in total outstanding debt 
In a statement released late Wednesday the Mexican Treasury 
Department said it asked its approximately 600 creditor banks 
permission to offer the bonds and that it received majority 
approval on Feb 5 
But Richard Marin a senior vice president at Bankers Trust Co 
told the conference I do not believe any major US banks will 
tender their loans under the Mexican plan 
US banks have provisions equal to about 25 percent of their 
Third World loan exposure and this wont cover the 50 percent 
discount at which Mexico expects the banks to swap their loans 
Marin said 
Marin indicated that the Mexican plan to swap loans for new 
bonds is designed for smaller US regional banks that wish to dump 
their Mexican exposure 
Franz Lutolf general manager at Swiss Bank Corp said his bank 
will submit a bid and called the plan a step in the right 
direction 
Lutolf wouldnt say at what discount his bank would tender its 
loans but indicated it would be above 50 percent of face value 
Fifty percent wont fly he said 
An official at Swiss Bank Corp in Basel who refused to be 
identified said the bank plans to tender about onethird of its 
Mexican loans but wouldnt say how large its exposure is 
The official said Swiss banks must have provisions equal to at 
least 35 percent of their Third World exposure and that his bank is 
comfortably above that level 
Auction of the bonds had been tentatively set for Feb 26 a 
week later than initially planned
