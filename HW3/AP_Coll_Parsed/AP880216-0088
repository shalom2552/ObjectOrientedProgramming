Marsha Streiff won the Liberal leg of the 
Shrove Tuesday transAtlantic pancake race for a second consecutive 
year today but for the sixth straight time the title went to 
England 
Mrs Streiff carrying a frying pan with a pancake in it 
completed the 415yard course in 677 seconds That was better than 
her winning time of 701 seconds last year but not enough to 
better that of Leslie Byrne a physical education teacher from 
Olney England 
Running six hours earlier in Olney Mrs Byrne turned in a 
winning time of 629 seconds 
The British victory tied the series at 19 each Mrs Streiff a 
30yearold mother of three also won in 1985 and as a threetime 
winner will not be able to compete again 
I didnt think of the pancake I just ran said Mrs Byrne 
I havent done any training though sometimes when I take the dog 
out for a walk I have a little trot 
Mrs Byrne outpaced 19 other women by about 10 yards at the end 
of the 415yard annual run from Olneys market square to its 
14thcentury church 
The competitors all wore the traditional skirt apron and head 
scarf About 700 spectators lined the twisting route in cool sunny 
weather in the Buckinghamshire market town of 3300 inhabitants 
about 40 miles northwest of London 
Previously competitors had continuously to flip a pancake in a 
pan as they ran but nowadays only a toss at the start and finish 
is required 
According to legend the race has been run in Olney since 1445 
when a forgetful housewife left for church on Shrove Tuesday with 
her frying pan still in her hand 
Shrove Tuesday is the day English women traditionally make 
pancakes to use up cooking fat before the start of 40 days of 
fasting for Lent 
After a lapse during World War II Olney revived the race in 
1948 People in the southwest Kansas town joined the race in 1950 
to make the contest an international event after seeing reports of 
the English competition 
Mrs Byrne received her prize of 100 pounds 175 various 
gifts from town merchants an inscribed silver tray from the town 
of Liberal and a kiss from Clive Coverley a ceremonial official 
known as the town verger 
Jackie Childs a housewife who finished second received 10 
pounds 1750 and vouchers from local shops 
A lemon juice company claimed a survey it conducted had found 
that at least 63 million pancakes would be served in Britain today 
and be sprinkled with 166000 gallons of lemon juice made from more 
than 2 million lemons 
A host of British celebrities tossed pancakes in a 12hour 
marathon today at Londons Waterloo train station to raise money 
for charity
