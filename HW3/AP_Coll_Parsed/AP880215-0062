The dollar fell slightly against most major 
currencies in light European trading this morning as dealers 
reported some profittaking 
Gold prices were little changed 
Foreign exchange dealers said todays announcement that the 
Japanese trade surplus had narrowed sharply to 3072 billion in 
January from 8601 billion in December had reinforced the markets 
more positive recent view of the dollar 
However dealers said a national holiday in the United States 
and a holiday in the northern part of West Germany meant trading 
would be limited and they predicted little movement for the dollar 
The Japanese trade figures were very promising even if not 
exceptional said one trader with a major Italian commercial bank 
in Milan But they solidified the feeling that the dollar may 
have turned the corner 
But dealers also warned that in such a thin market any 
profittaking would exaggerate rate movements 
There are no other factors except profittaking that could 
send the dollar lower said a trader at a major West German bank 
in Frankfurt 
In Tokyo where the business day ends as Europes begins the 
dollar rose 105 yen to a closing 13100 Later in London it was 
quoted lower at 13040 yen

In London the dollar fell against the British pound It cost

Gold was little changed from Fridays prices but lower than its 
opening levels Dealers said it was pressured by light 
profittaking
