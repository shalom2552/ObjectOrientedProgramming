A military jury today began deliberations 
in the retrial of Marine Cpl Lindsey Scott on charges he raped and 
tried to kill another Marines wife 
I am very confident that we will win it Scotts father 
James said I just think theres justice in the world 
Attorneys for both sides in Scotts second courtmartial wrapped 
up their cases Wednesday 
Civilian defense attorney John Leino charged that the Naval 
Investigative Service used improper lineup techniques and led the 
victim to her identification of Scott He said there was no 
forensic evidence linking Scott to the April 1983 crime 
Scott 32 of Louisville Ky was convicted of abduction rape 
sodomy and attempted murder but the verdict was overturned July 7 
by the US Military Court of Appeals on grounds he had an 
inadequate defense 
Leino said prosecutors also convinced the victim that Scott 
committed the crime In her mind someone has to pay he said 
Leino said it is ludicrous to believe that Scott a good 
Marine nothing but a good person snapped and committed a 
heinous crime 
Military prosecutor Maj Ron McNeil focused on the testimony of 
four investigators who said the passenger side of Scotts car had 
been wiped down the day after the attack at the Quantico Marine 
Corps base 
Was there a conspiracy here to make this up McNeil said 
Absolutely not Theres no conspiracy here 
We think that the motive in this case was sex and we 
believe that the intent was murder McNeil said 
McNeil also noted the victim positively identified Scott as her 
assailant from the witness stand and from physical and photographic 
lineups 
Scotts chief alibi witness Cynthia Ausby testified she saw 
Scott in a store where she worked as a security guard at the time 
of the rape The store is about 15 minutes from the base
