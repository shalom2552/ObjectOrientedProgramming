Key defense issues such as shortrange 
nuclear missiles and chemical weapons are likely to be on the 
agenda when Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets with President Reagan in 
Washington this week 
Kohl left for Washington today for the threeday visit that will 
include talks with President Reagan Secretary of State George P 
Shultz and leading members of Congress 
The opposition Social Democratic party called on the chancellor 
to press for a reduction in shortrange nuclear missiles in central 
Europe during the Washington talks 
The chancellor should work toward a concept for the withdrawal 
of shortrange missiles the partys arms control expert Karsten 
Voigt was quoted by the Neuen Osnabruecker newspaper as saying 
In recent days West German government officials have pointed 
out differences of opinion on these topics and urged the NATO 
alliance to develop an overall arms control strategy before 
pursuing new talks with the Soviet Union 
Before we sit at the table with the Soviets on new 
disarmament proposals we need to have agreement within the 
NATO alliance on overall strategy a topranking West German 
official told reporters Tuesday 
Officials said Kohl is likely to press for a worldwide ban on 
chemical weapons 
US officials have said it would be difficult to verify such a 
ban but West German experts contend that verification problems can 
be worked out 
We think the EastWest chemical weapons talks have reached a 
point where it is possible to reach an agreement this year said 
the West German official who spoke on condition that he not be 
further identified 
The official said West Germans are aware that US arms control 
negotiators are emphasizing working out reductions in strategic 
nuclear weapons and dont feel that the Genevabased chemical 
weapons talks are on the brink of agreement 
But it is important for us to represent our European interests 
within the NATO alliance he added 
Shortrange nuclear missiles or those with a range of less than 
300 miles are expected to be a main point of Kohls talks in 
Washington US officials in recent weeks have emphasized the 
importance of implementing a 1983 NATO decision to upgrade the 
shortrange nuclear weapons in central Europe 
US and other NATO officials have said the shortrange missiles 
are now more important to the alliance because of last Decembers 
superpower arms treaty which if ratified will scrap all 
landbased mediumrange missiles 
But the West German government says NATO must first develop 
overall arms control strategies and insists on reductions in Soviet 
superiority in conventional arms before upgrading the alliances 
shortrange missiles 
The Federal Republic of Germany sees no need for an isolated 
decision on modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear 
weapon systems at this point Friedhelm Ost chief government 
spokesman said Monday 
Such decisions should be taken only after new overall 
disarmament concepts are worked out he added
