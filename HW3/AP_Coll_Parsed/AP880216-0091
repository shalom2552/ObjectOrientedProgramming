Champion market animals will be tested 
for drugs for the first time this week at the San Antonio Livestock 
Exposition but no animal stands to lose a ribbon because of 
doping officials said 
This is the first stock show where anything like this is being 
done in the nation Dr Larry Ehrlund a San Antonio veterinarian 
who is coordinating the tests told the San Antonio ExpressNews 
Show officials said Monday that testing of champion market 
steers lambs and barrows is part of a survey by the Texas 
Veterinary Medical Association 
This is strictly for our information and the Texas Veterinary 
Medicine Associations information as to whether they do have 
drug residues said Richard Traylor of the SALE executive 
committee 
We have no idea whether we have a problem or we dont have a 
problem Traylor said This is more of a survey for 
information 
Tests are designed to detect 25 different compounds representing 
just about every potentially abused drug imaginable Ehrlund 
said 
Veterinarians are concerned that some show animals might be 
given drugs such as diuretics tranquilizers or anabolic steroids 
which give the owner an unfair advantage he said 
A similar program will be conducted at the stock show in San 
Angelo next month and at other shows in Texas 
No decision has been made about releasing the results or about 
what policy to set for next year concerning the tests Traylor said
