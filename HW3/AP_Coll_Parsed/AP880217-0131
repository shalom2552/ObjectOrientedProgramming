The Israeli National Tourist 
Bureau has canceled an advertisement it was running in Dutch 
newspapers that said Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were only a stones 
throw apart a bureau spokesman said Wednesday 
The bureau withdrew the ad because of the ongoing unrest in the 
Israelioccupied territories where Palestinian youths frequently 
hurl rocks and other objects at troops said spokesman Albert 
Kooistra 
The ad which ran last week in two newspapers and in three TV 
program guides was meant to emphasize the short distances between 
Israels cities and other tourist sites Kooistra said 
The distance between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem About a stones 
throw Kooistra quoted the ad as saying 
Speaking figuratively thats true only I think the text must 
have caused something of a shock in the current context he said 
Jerusalem another frequent venue for recent protests and Tel 
Aviv are about 37 miles apart 
Kooistra said the bureau had received about a dozen protest 
calls and letters and decided to drop the ad this week because of 
the emotions it triggered 
The ad had been written in August well before the unrest 
erupted Kooistra said 
We found out too late that the slogan is unfit he said
