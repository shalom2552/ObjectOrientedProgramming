Thailand and Laos agreed Wednesday to a 
truce and disengagement in a disputed sparsely populated border 
area where hundreds of their soldiers have been killed since 
November 
The agreement was reached after two days of talks in Bangkok 
between military teams led by Thailands army commander Gen 
Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth and the Laotian chief of staff Gen 
Sisavat Keobounphan 
We have agreed to end the fighting and stop the bloodshed 
Sisavat told reporters 
Gen Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth and I have agreed that from now 
on our supreme commands will wage no more war end all clashes in 
the air along rivers and along the LaosThai border Let that 
border represent friendship and peace 
Chaovalit told a separate news conference the talks created a 
basis for the establishment of improved ties In the future force 
will not be used to settle differences Let the Mekong River 
boundary not only stand for friendship and peace but also signify 
an important bond 
A joint statement said the nations expressed their sincere 
determination to put an end to the clashes and bloodshed in the 
area The small hilly area in dispute lies between Thailands 
Phitsanulok province and the Sayaboury province of Laos about 250 
miles north of Bankkok 
Both sides claim it on the basis of a 1907 FrenchThai treaty 
and internationally recognized maps 
The statement said the ceasefire would begin at 8 am Friday 
8 pm Thursday EST and a joint military coordinating group would 
monitor the truce and disengagement 
It said the agreement had created an atmosphere conducive to 
political negotiations and both delegations would ask their 
governments to begin talks on resolving the border question within 
15 days after the ceasefire starts

and strikes by Thai air force F5E jet fighterbombers since the 
military conflict began in November Thailand also claims dozens of 
Vietnamese were killed fighting on the Laotian side

after Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda of Thailand accepted a 
proposal of talks made by the Laotian premier Kaysone Phomvihane
