Five newspaper unions dropped their opposition 
Tuesday to the proposed partial merger of two Detroit newspapers 
saying joint operation is the only way to assure the survival 
of the Detroit Free Press 
In briefs filed with the Justice Department the unions urged 
Attorney General Edwin Meese III to approve the agreement 
The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press have requested 
permission to merge their advertising circulation and production 
departments and to enter into a profitsharing agreement under a 
law designed to protect newspaper competition when one of the 
publications is in danger of going out of business The newspapers 
would retain separate news and editorial departments 
Justice Department spokesman Mark Sheehan said he expected Meese 
to act as promptly as he can on the proposed agreement 
A Justice Department administrative law judge Morton Needelman 
in December upheld a recommendation by the departments antitrust 
division that the proposed joint operating agreement be disapproved 
Directors of KnightRidder Inc owner of the Free Press 
countered by stating their intent to close the 156yearold 
newspaper if Meese fails to approve the JOA 
Attorneys for KnightRidder and for Gannett Co Inc owner of 
the News argued in January that the boards decision introduced a 
new element into the case that made it imperative that Meese 
approve the agreement 
The antitrust division in a brief filed Tuesday argued that 
evidence in the case showed that KnightRidder at the time the 
newspapers announced their application of the joint operating 
agreement in 1986 was willing to continue subsidizing the Free 
Press 
Whether a newspaper is failing within the meaning of the 
Newspaper Preservation Act should properly be determined as of 
the time it enters into a JOA agreement not on the basis of 
decisions made in the face of subsequent failure to win approval 
under the statute the division said 
The division also asserted that Needelman was correct in arguing 
that the News had not attained a clearly dominant position in 
Detroit market and therefore the Free Press was not a failing 
newspaper 
The unions dropping their opposition to the merger were Detroit 
Typographical Union No 18 Newspaper Drivers and Handlers Local 
372 Graphic Communication International Union Local 289M Detroit 
Mailers Local No 2040 and Detroit Newspaper Printing and Graphic 
Communications Union Local 13N They represent employees at both 
newspapers 
The unions said the decision by KnightRidder directors and 
evidence in the case led us to conclude after very careful 
consideration that the Free Press is in probable danger of 
financial failure within the meaning of the Newspaper Preservation 
Act 
We have further concluded that the JOA is the only way to 
assure the survival of the Free Press and the preservation of two 
independent editorial voices in Detroit the unions said 
One union remained opposed to the partial merger The Newspaper 
Guild Local 22 representing editorial employees vote 34984 
Monday night to continue opposition to the JOA 
Guild officials bargained and then voted without knowing that 
the other unions had reversed their opposition to the JOA said 
Donald Kummer administrative officer of the guilds Local 22 
Unless we can resolve the problems that have existed since 
this thing was announced I dont see any change in my position 
he said 
The newspapers asserted that union opposition had been based on 
the premise that a JOA would mean a loss of 600 to 1000 jobs at 
the newspapers 
The unions now clearly understand that the status quo will not 
be maintained if the JOA is denied but rather the Free Press will 
close and all 2200 jobs at the Free Press will be lost the 
newspapers said 
The News and the Free Press have long been locked in a battle 
for newspaper dominance in Detroit The News which is the larger 
newspaper has lost 75 million since 1979 and the Free Press has 
lost 100 million according to KnightRidder
