Britains first major industrial strike in several 
years the 8dayold national walkout by more than 32000 Ford 
autoworkers has not been primarily about money 
Instead it is an emotional dispute over the auto makers push 
to impose more Japanesestyle work practices on reluctant employees 
Such practices including computerization more flexibility 
among workers and the cutting of autopart inventories have 
angered hourly workers enough for them to reject a sweetened offer 
from Ford by more than a 60 percent margin even though union 
negotiators had recommended it 
Ironically such practices also have made Ford Motor Co Ltd 
British subsidiary of the US auto maker and the largest auto 
maker in Britain especially vulnerable to this strike 
The companys production in Europe was quickly affected when the 
walkout began Feb 8 because the new efficiency at its European 
plants means they also now are more interdependent 
The strike Fords first British strike in nearly a decade has 
halted production at all Fords 22 British plants 
The action also has prompted the layoff of more than 9700 
workers and disrupted production at a Ford plant in Genk Belgium 
which suffered a shortage of Britishmade parts 
It also has threatened production at Ford plants in West Germany 
and Spain which also rely on parts made at Fords British plants 
In addition it has cost Ford 40 million a day at showroom 
prices in lost British car production 
Talks between the Transport and General Workers Union which 
represents twothirds of the workers representatives of the 11 
unions that represent the rest and company officials resumed today 
after an 11day hiatus 
Our primary goal has been to improve efficiency and 
productivity said a Ford spokesman who wasnt identified in 
accordance with British custom 
Ford believes it needs to impose more efficient manufacturing 
methods to boost productivity and better fight off its competitors 
such as Nissan Motor Co in a market burdened with overcapacity 
Nissan operates a highly productive plant in Sunderland in 
northeast England 
We are not attempting slavishly to copy the Japanese We are 
attempting solutions to our own problems the Ford spokesman said 
Ford wants to introduce more flexibility so that for example a 
skilled worker could work on a production line But some skilled 
workers apparently balk at working alongside unskilled workers 
And some workers also appear to fear being overworked 
Strikers have criticized Japanesestyle work practices But the 
Economist said The strike has been led by men in Dagenham 
assembly plant in booming east London where workers feel they 
can demand big bribes in return for changing their work habits Not 
so in northeast England 
Indeed not all British workers have reacted this way to the 
increasing use of such manufacturing methods at Japanese and 
nonJapanese plants throughout Britain 
Many British workers in poorer areas of the country such as the 
northeast have felt downtrodden by the class system and are 
intimately familiar with Britains widespread unemployment These 
have eagerly embraced the Japanese practices of equality and job 
security 
The new manufacturing techniques Ford imposed some worker 
flexibility computerization and the slashing of inventories of 
auto parts to reduce costs increased the auto makers 
productivity and profitability sharply 
Each Ford employee produced 95 cars in 1986 vs 64 each in 
1984 in Britain Ford produced more than 383000 cars in 1987 in 
Britain 
The British subsidiarys pretax profit tripled to about 569 
million from 191 million in 1986 analysts estimate Ford wont 
report its results for a few months 
Union officials said opposition to Fords offer also centered on 
its threeyear term the first of its kind ever sought in the 
British auto industry Previous contracts have been for one or two 
years 
Some workers said they also object to linking their pay 
increases to government statistics for inflation because they claim 
the government underestimates the true rate of increase in consumer 
prices 
The companys sweetened threeyear contract offer included a pay 
rise of 7 percent in the first year followed by rises of 25 
percent above the level of inflation in the scond and third years 
The present pay of a middlerange worker is 327 a week 
The last major industrial strike in Britain was a yearlong 
walkout by more than 90000 coal miners in 19841985 
Fords British workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978
