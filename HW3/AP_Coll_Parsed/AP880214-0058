The street party named Carnival delighted 
paradegoers Sunday but caused trouble for florists delivering 
Valentines Day bouquets 
It hinders delivery and we cant make full service said 
Ronnie Scheinuk vice president and general manager of a company 
started by his grandfather Were right on a parade route 
Three of the 11 parades scheduled Sunday in New Orleans and its 
suburbs roll down St Charles Avenue right past the store 
Scheinuk said his shop would close several hours before the third 
a nighttime spectacular put on by the Krewe of Bacchus 
It gets so crowded and hectic that our people would not be 
able to get home he said We have to think of them 
Sundays deliveries werent as hard as those on Valentines Day 
1973 he said That day the sweethearts holiday coincided with 
Fat Tuesday 
Scheinuk said a delivery crew of 10 was on the street at 630 
am Sunday and was finished by 1130 a halfhour before the first 
parade rolled in front of his store 
However there were compensations for being on a major parade 
route Weve had tremendous walkin business Scheinuk said
