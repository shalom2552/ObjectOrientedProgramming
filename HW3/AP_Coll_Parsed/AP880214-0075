What happens in New Hampshire may decide who 
among the Democratic presidential candidates get to go South with 
Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr while Pat Robertson is looking 
forward to the first Republican contest in the South no matter what 
happens Tuesday 
Analysts say that Robertson who in Iowa pushed up between 
frontrunners Bob Dole and George Bush will be on his friendliest 
turf when the presidential season moves into its Southern phase In 
New Hampshire polls put him in a dead heat for third place with 
Rep Jack Kemp of New York and former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont 
Contests are scheduled in Wyoming South Dakota and a handful of 
other states in the three weeks after Tuesdays New Hampshire 
primary 
The next main event is the Super Tuesday primary across most of 
the South and in several other states on March 8 but the South 
Carolina primary three days before that could emerge as a crucial 
GOP test 
Theres tremendous potential for Robertson to be a spoiler 
here said Earl Black political scientist at the University of 
South Carolina Hes putting a lot of money and organizational 
effort into South Carolina Hes thrown down the gauntlet and I 
think hes in position to back that up 
On the Democratic side the presidential race in the South will 
be shaped by New Hampshires results 
Iowa winner Richard Gephardt hopes that a secondplace finish 
behind local favorite Michael Dukakis governor of neighboring 
Massachusetts will propel the Missouri congressman into a strong 
position to face the Souths native son Gore of Tennessee 
A Gephardt finish behind Sen Paul Simon of Illinois and 
Dukakis however could leave the field still muddled as it turns 
South a page right out of Gores script 
Former Colorado Sen Gary Hart and former Arizona Gov Bruce 
Babbitt have been polling at the bottom of the Democratic pack in 
New Hampshire and are hoping Tuesday for surprising finishes to 
keep their faltering campaigns alive long enough for Super Tuesday 
Already there are signs of bad blood between the rival 
campaigns of Gephardt and Gore who is competing in New Hampshire 
but has reserved most of his money for the Southern campaign Both 
Democrats have designs on the white moderatetoconservative 
Democratic vote in the South 
Gephardts campaign manager William Carrick used harsh language 
to the Washington Post last week about Gore He said I cant 
wait Its blood lust Let me at him I hate him I hate all of 
them 
The Gore campaign said Sunday that Carrick formally apologized 
todayfor profane personal attacks and comments critical of Gore 
and and Gores campaign The apologies were made to both Gore 
himself and campaign manager Fred Martin said Arlie Schardt press 
secretary for the Gore campaign 
Both Gore and Martin accepted the apology and agreed with 
Carrick that the matter was over Schardt said in a statement 
Martin said the campaign remains convinced the influence of Iowa 
and New Hampshire will be diminished this year by Gores chosen 
battleground the South 
South Carolina Republicans dominated by loyalists to Bush set 
up their primary on Saturday March 5 in hopes it would give the 
vice president a boost in case he needed it before the Super 
Tuesday primaries in the rest of the South 
But now Robertson a former TV evangelist who lives in West 
Virginia has targeted South Carolina as his next best chance and 
predicted he will win it outright 
Robertsons strong Iowa secondplace finish behind Dole handing 
Bush a humiliating third place was explained in part by 
Robertsons strong organization among fundamentalist and 
charismatic Christian voters and the traditionally low turnout of 
caucus contests In South Carolina he has a primary rather than a 
caucus but one with a history of low turnout and a Biblebelt 
location favorable to his message 
Using those evangelical churches and his hightech methods to 
get his people out and rolling the church buses on Saturday he 
can find a lot of voters Black said 
Elsewhere in the South Republicans say Robertson may 
demonstrate a strength not detected in the polls 
Robertson will probably come in second in Georgia if he 
doesnt come in first said Bob Bell former Georgia GOP state 
chairman 
This is the Bible Belt he said I think really there is 
something happening 
Bush is credited with a Southern organization far superior to 
that of Dole and polls show him far and away the Southern leader 
But a loss in New Hampshire to the Senate majority leader from 
Kansas could leave Bush struggling to hang on to both his 
organization and his poll lead 
Bush has to look ahead said Norm Ornstein political 
analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute He has 
crafted what may be a Maginot Line If we do badly in Iowa weve 
got New Hampshire If we do badly there weve got South Carolina 
If Pat Robertson takes away a victory from him in South 
Carolina thats it 
Bushs southern coordinator Lanny Griffith however insists 
that Bush can remain strong in the South even with another setback 
Frankly we dont have any bad states in the South Griffith 
said We lead in every state We lead in every demographic group 
among conservatives and independents There is no region of the 
South or demographic group where we dont lead 
Dole is at an organizational disadvantage in the South but has 
had his wife Elizabeth a native of North Carolina working the 
region for him Her home state is considered a key strength for 
Dole in the South 
Doles Southern spokesman Clark Reid claimed a groundswell 
of support following Iowa You have to take into account we 
havent done any paid media ads yet in the South Reid said
