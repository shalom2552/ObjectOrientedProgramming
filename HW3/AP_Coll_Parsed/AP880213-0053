Taking Valentines Day seriously is the raison 
detre behind Paris first Salon de lAmour where the lovelorn 
can seek counsel in trying to ignite revive or fan the flames of 
passion 
Why is love always presented in such a fragmented way when 
love is indivisible asked Fabienne Baudot an organizer of the 
fourday exhibition The range of exhibitors here is 
intentionally vast to give visitors as much information as 
possible 
Stands around the hall display sense enhancers such as lingerie 
and aphrodisiacs There are counselors on sex and health and a 
booth with information on AIDS 
Its not because you love a car that you know how to drive 
it said Dr Jacques Waynberg a leading Paris sexologist who is 
among the specialists lecturing on love at the event that runs 
through Valentines Day 
The traditional box of chocolates has been replaced by a new 
Valentines Day wine produced in the Rhone river town of 
Roquemaure where the relics of St Valentine are kept 
Valentines Day gets less fanfare in France than across the 
Atlantic and experts say this first salon reflects a trend 
An exhibition founded on the word love wouldnt have been 
understood by the French public five years ago Waynberg said in 
an interview Then people were more sensitized to the sexual 
dimension of things 
An exhibit on eroticism is held in Paris annually But in 
France as in other Western countries the trend is toward the less 
ephemeral aspects of a relationship 
Waynberg told a conference that sex is like a job to be 
learned and that sex and love do not necessarily mix 
Erotic life obeys a certain competence It is a job You have 
to know how to make love he said Otherwise its like giving 
a beautiful book to someone who doesnt know how to read 
Waynberg emphasized the fragile foundations of many 
relationships so often based on passionate or sentimental love 
both volatile commodities 
Its a sentiment that I question as a professional he said 
In poetry it is good In art it is perfect In itself it is 
highly questionable I dont say love is sad but I say its 
dangerous 
If there is no marriage de raison between a couple then you 
must have reason in a marriage of love 
The emphasis on passion and sex is falling off according to a 
recent cover story in the newsweekly VSD 
A 1972 study showed that 80 percent of French adults considered 
a successful sex life a determining source of happiness A poll 
taken in 1986 showed that only 39 percent of French people 
considered sex a determining factor in their happiness 
A poll earlier this month indicated that one French woman in 
three and one French man in four is sometimes or often 
bored during lovemaking 
Todays young generation is moving away from the joys of eros 
Waynberg said The young women are taking a fresh look at their 
grandmothers mistresses of hearth and home and reassessing their 
options 
Grandmother was maybe not such a bimbo after all Waynberg 
said 
As the session closed a portly elderly man shook his head in 
agreement Sex and love are two separate things he said Then 
turning to his neighbor he recalled his late wife who died eight 
years ago 
During her illness she told him to pay a visit to another woman 
Another woman the man repeated with a hint of amazement and 
admiration and as though the incident were yesterday Now thats 
love isnt it Thats love
