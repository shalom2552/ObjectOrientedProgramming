San Franciscos new mayor has spurned 
the battleship USS Missouri rekindling a rivalry among three ports 
eager to be home to the Mighty Mo and its sailors and their 
money 
Despite interest from Long Beach San Diego and Honolulu the 
Navy says it wants to stick with an earlier decision to base the 
ship in San Francisco where former Mayor Dianne Feinstein won a 
Navy competition to host it by offering 55 million in port 
improvements 
However Feinsteins successor Art Agnos made it part of his 
election campaign to oppose the port funds on environmental and 
other grounds despite the estimated 100 million a year in 
revenues the ship could bring 
Evidently the people of San Francisco dont want it and 
weve always wanted it Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said last 
week when he joined local business leaders in launching a new 
campaign to host the ship 
For some affection for the World War IIera behemoth upon 
whose decks the Japanese surrendered in World War II isnt all 
based on coldblooded economics 
Its a grand and glorious ship said Morrie Dawkins a 
Bremerton Wash councilman who is trying to drum up support to 
reclaim the ship for his city where it was mothballed for 25 years 
and attracted 300000 annual visitors 
The Missouri one of four battleships recommissioned in recent 
years now operates out of the Long Beach Naval Station though 
its officially based in San Francisco and awaiting completion of 
port improvements there that were part the deal struck by Feinstein 
with the Navy 
Long Beach is already official home port for one of the other 
newly active battleships the USS New Jersey 
Agnos a liberal Democrat hasnt formally conveyed his feelings 
to the Navy said his spokesman Scott Shafer However the mayor 
agrees with community activists who say the required dredging would 
pose an environmental threat to San Francisco Bay and that 
reactivating Navy facilities at Hunters Point would force eviction 
of artists and others who rent space there Shafer said 
Hes been very consistent all along Shafer said Hes 
opposed it and hell continue to oppose it 
Agnos has pledged to veto the 55 million if the money is 
approved by the citys Board of Supervisors which endorsed the 
plan last August and can override Agnos veto No date has been set 
for final approval of the plan 
A Navy spokesman in Washington Lt Kippy Burns said earlier 
this month that if San Francisco fails to provide the financial 
support then that would obviously stop the Navy from going to 
Hunters Point 
The Missouri leads a battle group that includes four cruisers 
and several frigates or destroyers with a combined payroll of 60 
million a year 
Elsewere US Rep Duncan Hunter a Republican who represents 
the San Diego area met Tuesday with Navy Secretary James Webb 
urging that the ship berth permanently in San Diego An aide to 
Hunter said the congressman is concerned about the economic impact 
of threatened cuts in the fleet in that city 
The case for Honolulus Pearl Harbor was pressed by Gov John 
Waihee in a meeting with Webb last year said Carolyn Tanaka 
spokeswoman for the Democratic governor 
Even when the Navy decided to homeport the Missouri in San 
Francisco the state has kept a little bit of an ember burning 
telling them were still interested Ms Tanaka said I would 
imagine that based on whats happened recently the embers are 
bigger now she added
