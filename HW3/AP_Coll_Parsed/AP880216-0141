An experimental drug for treatment of one of 
the main lifethreatening infections associated with AIDS was 
approved for wider use Tuesday 
Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R Bowen said 
trimetrexate has been moved into the treatment investigational 
new drug category for treatment of certain Pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia patients 
However because the drug has potentially lethal sideeffects it 
must be used in conjunction with another drug called leucovorin 
that mitigates those effects 
Under Food and Drug Administrations conditions accompanying 
approval for wider use of trimetrexate it is to be distributed to 
patients who have shown a severe adverse reaction to the two drugs 
already on the market for treating Pneumocystis carinii 
Elaine Baldwin a spokeswoman for the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that means trimetrexate is 
likely to be available to about 300 patients nationwide 
She said it will be made available free to patients who qualify 
with NIAID a branch of the National Institutes of Health and 
the manufacturer WarnerLambert Co of Morris Plains NJ 
handling distribution and bearing the cost 
Despite the existence of two powerful drugs to treat the rare 
form of pneumonia scientists involved in clinical trials have been 
interested in the possibility that trimetrexate may prove less 
toxic for some patients when it is used in conjunction with 
leucovorin 
This treatment IND will allow us to offer an important 
treatment alternative to severely ill patients who cannot tolerate 
the standard therapy said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci 
Under the socalled treatment IND category drug developers and 
researchers can make promising experimental drugs available to 
patients with immediately lifethreatening diseases before the 
drugs have passed full safety and efficacy review by the FDA 
That makes it more widely available to certain patients but 
under more carefully controlled conditions than when a drug wins 
approval for general marketing 
Bowen made the announcement at the start of a twoday seminar 
sponsored jointly by the FDA and American Medical Association to 
familiarize health professions with the new treatment IND rules 
that went into effect late last year 
AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections The virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus 
now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV 
Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
users although a small percentage of cases are attributed to 
transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread 
from infected pregnant women to their offspring
