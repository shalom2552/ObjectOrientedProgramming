Police agreed Monday to beef up security at 
a sprawling shopping mall after fights broke out among some 
teenagers 
I cant give you any numbers but we are going to have some 
more officers out there this weekend Moline Police Capt Thomas 
Marxen said Monday after meeting with officials of Southpark Mall 
We are confident there wont be any more problems out there 
he said 
But police said early accounts of the incident were exaggerated 
though an estimated 100 teens were on hand they were not all 
involved police said 
All 100 kids were not fighting A scuffle broke out here and 
there among the group Moline Police Lt Ken Hanger said 
They found one barbecue fork and one piece of wood very few 
weapons he said 
Three 15yearolds from nearby Rock Island were arrested on 
disorderly conduct charges Saturday after teenagers started 
fighting near a drug store at the mall police said Those arrested 
were released later that day 
People were scared in here said one merchant Victor Meeks 
I had people crowding around this booth and asking me if they 
could get inside because they were scared 
Disturbances have been escalating for weeks at the 135store 
mall merchants said with some saying it involved high school 
rivalries and others saying it was a deliberate diversion to 
provide cover for shoplifters 
Two or three people were fighting and some other gang members 
came down and got involved in it mall employee Dan Kreiter said 
Its been building every weekend and every time a few more people 
get mad It just built up until everything let loose 
Mall officials hired police officers to work Saturday because 
they were expecting problems after minor fights had broken out the 
weekend before Marxen said 
We werent expecting such a large number of kids Police 
Sgt Barry Schmelzer said We had two officers in the area but 
they werent able to contain the crowd not only the people who 
were fighting but the people who gathered
