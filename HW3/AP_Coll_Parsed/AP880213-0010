Two US warships are back to routine 
operations in the Black Sea after being deliberately bumped by 
Soviet vessels in a confrontation off the Crimean coast the 
Pentagon says 
Navy officials said the ships were struck while exercising their 
right to pass through international waters The Soviets said the 
US ships violated its border 
And the State Department which protested the bumping said the 
incident showed once again that USSoviet relations are a 
continuing blend of the good and the bad in what spokesman Rudolph 
Boone called a competitive relationship 
He said that Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost summoned 
Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin to receive a strong US protest and 
that Defense Secretary Frank C Carlucci would raise the issue in a 
meeting with Soviet officials in Bern Switzerland next month 
The flareup occurred Friday when according to the Navy the 
cruiser USS Yorktown was deliberately struck by a frigate and the 
destroyer USS Caron was deliberately struck by a smaller coastal 
patrol boat 
The two American vessels were exercising their right of 
innocent passage within the 12mile territorial waters claimed 
by the Soviets the Navy said The Navy says its assertion of 
rights program calls for steaming periodically through contested 
waters to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas 
The Soviet Union countered with a charge that the US Navy 
ships violated its border ignored warnings and dangerously 
maneuvered in Soviet territorial waters 
Navy Capt Gerry Flynn gave this account at a Pentagon briefing 
The Soviets had been shadowing the US vessels since they 
entered the Black Sea earlier in the week and headed northward to 
the Crimean coast 
At about 11 am local time Friday or 3 am EST the Soviets 
broadcast the following warning to the US ships Soviet ships 
have orders to prevent violation of territorial waters I am 
authorized to strike your ship with one of ours The Caron 
responded I am engaged in innocent passage consistent with 
international law 
The two Soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on the 
American vessels which were as we would say in the Navy 
shouldered out of the way 
When neither the Caron nor Yorktown changed course a 
Krivakclass frigate moved up on the Yorktown and a Mirkaclass 
patrol vessel moved on the Caron grazing the left sides of the 
each 
The Yorktown and Caron maintained their course and speed despite 
the bumping eventually steaming farther from the Soviet coast 
Flynn concluded by saying the latest report I have now is 
that both ships are operating routinely in the Black Sea as 
planned 
Unlike the United States which claims a threemile territorial 
limit the Soviet Union claims a 12mile limit along its coast 
said Cmdr Richard Schiff a Navy lawyer The United States will 
accept such a claim but any country claiming 12 miles must allow 
for innocent passage by the ships of all nations he said 
A highranking State Department official speaking on condition 
of anonymity said that although the department protested Soviet 
behavior he did not expect the incident to disturb a USSoviet 
effort to narrow differences on arms control human rights 
regional disputes and bilateral issues 
Secretary of State George P Shultz is scheduled to go to Moscow 
in two weeks to further those efforts and talk about a USSoviet 
summit meeting tentatively scheduled in the Soviet capital in the 
spring 
Retired Rear Adm Robert J Hanks a former director of 
strategic plans and policy for the Navy said testing rights of 
passage was an important necessity for the United States but is 
accompanied by risks such as those encountered Friday 
He said the two countries set up a commission to discuss such 
incidents under what the Navy calls the wrinkled fender 
agreement 
Efforts to assess the blame for the latest incident he 
predicted will be a big rhetorical contest with the Soviets 
Another former admiral Eugene Carroll who commanded ships in 
the Black Sea said such incidents are inevitable given the 
conflicting US and Soviet goals He said of Fridays action 
Its really scary
