Nobel Prizewinning physicist Richard 
Feynman who worked on the development of the atomic bomb during 
World War II and helped investigate the 1986 Challenger space 
shuttle disaster died at age 69 
A professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute 
of Technology since 1950 Feynman died Monday night at UCLA Medical 
Center from complications due to recurrent abdominal cancer said 
hospital spokesman Rich Elbaum 
In 1965 Feynman shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Julian 
S Schwinger and Shinichero Tomonaga for developing an improved 
theory of quantum electrodynamics The three men worked 
independently in the 1940s and arrived at the same theory which 
allows scientists to predict the effects of electrically charged 
particles on each other in a radiation field 
In the death of Richard Feynman the world has lost one of its 
greatest intellects said Lee A DuBridge president emeritus of 
Caltech 
Marvin L Goldberger director of the Institute for Advanced 
Study in Princeton NJ and a former Caltech president recalled 
Feynman as a towering figure in 20thcentury physics who was 
always curious always modest always ebullient always willing 
to share his deep insights with students and colleagues 
Feynman was a member of the atomic bomb project staff at 
Princeton in 1942 and 1943 and at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory 
in New Mexico from 1943 to 1945 
During a committee investigation after the Jan 28 1986 
explosion of the space shuttle Challenger which killed the seven 
crew members he emerged as one of the leading critics of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
Feynman accused NASA of erratic attention to safety matters that 
he likened to playing Russian roulette 
Born in New York on May 11 1918 Feynman graduated from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science 
degree in 1939 He received a PhD from Princeton in 1942 
Feynmans scientific interests developed early with the aid of 
his father a clothing salesman who taught him elementary 
mathematics and read his toddler son scientific studies 
I grew up with him and I knew him through many stages and he 
is just a terrific guy Feynmans cousin Frances Lewine said 
early today 
The young scholar joined the Cornell University faculty in 1945 
as an associate professor of theoretical physics and remained there 
until moving to Caltech in 1950 
It was at Cornell that Feynman did the work that led to his 
Nobel Prize 
He was also a dynamic writer His 1985 autobiography Surely 
Youre Joking Mr Feynman on the New York Times bestseller 
list for 14 weeks demonstrated his canny humor and strong like for 
formality 
He also wrote QED The Strange Theory of Light and Matter 
an explanation of quantum electrodynamics published in 1986 and 
was coauthor of the 1963 textbook The Feynman Lectures on 
Physics 
He was especially popular with Caltech students who honored him 
for teaching excellence in 1982 
Despite his stature as a professor he continued to teach 
freshman physics classes over the years and to ham it up in school 
plays once taking on the role of a bongo player in the musical 
Guys and Dolls 
Caltech officials reported that when Feynman became ill a few 
years ago students and teachers overwhelmed local medical 
facilities with offers to donate blood 
His many honors and awards included Princetons Albert Einstein 
award the Atomic Energy Commissions EO Lawrence Award the 
Oersted Medal for teaching the Niels Bohr International gold medal 
and the Albert Einstein College of Medicines Einstein award 
He is survived by his wife Gweneth son Carl daughter 
Michelle and sister Joan
