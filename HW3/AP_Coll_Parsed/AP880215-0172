Roxanne Pulitzer whose version of 
life in exclusive Palm Beach hit The New York Times bestseller list 
this week says she feels no bitterness toward her exhusband five 
years after their tawdry wellpublicized divorce 
This is my Valentines Day present Ms Pulitzer said of 
reaching No 10 Sunday on the national nonfiction bestseller list 
with The Prize Pulitzer The Scandal That Rocked Palm Beach The 
Real Story 
The book which on its first page calls Palm Beach a Buffet 
Society Babylon is full of gossip about the rich and famous 
from Alfred Bloomingdale to Barbra Streisand 
There are also descriptions of her cocaine use and sexual 
fantasies and realities She says that the first time she slept 
with publishing heir Herbert Peter Pulitzer she fantasized 
about making love to OJ Simpson the former star running back for 
the Buffalo Bills football team 
Ms Pulitzer 36 is surprisingly favorable to Pulitzer who has 
remarried and says he has not read his exwifes book 
I married him because he was the sexiest smartest funniest 
strongest most intriguing and interesting man I had ever known 
she says in the book They met when her first marriage to an 
upstate New Yorker with a home in Palm Beach broke up 
In an interview she said she and Pulitzer 56 no longer have 
any personal conversations She says she once loved him and does 
not bear him any bitterness 
Sadder but wiser Ive learned that the rules are different in 
Palm Beach just as the rich are different Both are more ruthless 
My story is about that difference and my failure to appreciate it 
whether out of foolishness love passion or all three she says 
in the book 
At the 1982 divorce trial Pulitzer and other witnesses 
testified about her cocaine use affairs occult experimentation 
and in general gross moral misconduct in the words of Circuit 
Judge Carl Harper 
Harper awarded custody of their twin sons to her husband Ms 
Pulitzer who has visitation rights got to keep her Porsche 
jewelry and some other items and received 2000 a month alimony 
for two years 
Stunned by the ruling and outraged by the portrayal of her as 
she recalls in her book a sexcrazed cocaineaddicted disciple 
of witchcraft Ms Pulitzer refused all interviews and book 
offers 
Her money gone she posed nude in Playboy in 1985 received 
more calls from publishers and changed her mind 
A lot of it had to do with the headlines of 1982 which left a 
negative taste in everybodys mouth It just gnawed at me 
constantly that that was a negative situation I hadnt taken care 
of said Ms Pulitzer a native of Cassadaga NY 
Kleenex heir James Kimberly whose former wife Jacquie plays a 
prominent role in the book as the third person in an alleged menage 
a trois with the Pulitzers says the book is garbage 
Do you eat garbage Its utter garbage as far Im 
concerned Kimberly told The Palm Beach Post 
I have no comment on that Pulitzer said of his exwifes 
literary success when contacted Monday at his estate in Okeechobee 
I have two young boys to bring up Thats a fulltime job 
Before hanging up he added that he hasnt read the book 
Other prominent Palm Beachers have said the book is just another 
in a string of attacks on the highsociety enclave that prides 
itself on exclusivity including Doonesbury cartoons by Garry 
Trudeau comparing ID requirements to South African laws that 
enforce apartheid 
Ms Pulitzer said she has written an upbeat book thats not 
revengeoriented for Villard Books with help from Kathleen Maxa 
She also says she wanted to provide a settherecordstraight 
account for her sons Mac and Zac now 10 and to present her 
arguments for joint custody in divorces although she admitted few 
people are buying the book for her opinions on divorce law 
She saves her venom for Palm Beach Although she lives in an 
apartment here across a shipping channel from her old stomping 
grounds she still shops and gets her hair done in Palm Beach she 
says 
The reactions she receives vary from insults to congratulations 
for her courage she says 
Palm Beachers as a whole have always thought of me as an 
intruder that I married into a lifestyle I didnt deserve that I 
didnt go to the right boarding schools she said 
In Palm Beach you have to be Episcopalian you cant be 
Catholic you cant be Jewish you cant be black I find that all 
to be very wrong she said
