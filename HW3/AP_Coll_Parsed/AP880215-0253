We emerged from 1987 with a corporate structure focused on our 
core business and designed to optimize the growth opportunities of 
each of our businesses said CocaCola Chairman Roberto C 
Goizueta

in the citrus market and strategic investments in the bottling and 
entertainment businesses we fully expect another strong 
performance in 1988

alone increased 9 percent Domestic sales of soft drink syrup and 
concentrates rose 1 percent

increased 25 percent for the year due primarily to a weaker 
dollar the company said 
Sales of juices and fruit drinks made by CocaColas food 
division also were up although operating income was down 45 
percent because of longrange investments in the orange juice
