PARIS AP UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor on Tuesday 
told representatives of Western journalists that he will take an 
active role on behalf of three reporters held hostage in Lebanon a 
press representative said 
The group met with Mayor to seek his intervention on behalf of 
Terry Anderson chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated 
Press British television cameraman John McCarthy and French 
magazine writer JeanPaul Kauffmann who marked his 1000th day in 
captivity Tuesday 
Anderson missing since March 16 1985 is the longest held of 
the 22 foreign hostages in Beirut and McCarthy has been missing 
since April 17 1986 
The group met with Mayor for a 40minute closeddoor session 
The journalists were led by Mia Doornaert diplomatic correspondent 
of the Dutch newspaper De Standaard and president of the 
Brusselsbased International Federation of Journalists 
It included Harry Conroy general secretary of Britains 
National Union of Journalists and Gerard Gatinot a Frenchman 
representing the the Praguebased International Organization of 
Journalists 
Ms Doornaert said Mayor promised to hold meetings with the 
governments concerned those whose citizens are hostages and those 
with influence in the area 
The names of specific countries were not mentioned according to 
participants but it was common knowledge that Iran exercises some 
influence over the Shiite Moslem groups holding foreign hostages 
Iran is a member of the United Nations Educational Scientific 
and Cultural Organization 
UNESCO has a special human rights group that takes up 
imprisonment cases with member governments It also has sponsored 
meetings in the past involving the two journalists federations on 
professional issues 
Two officials of the Newspaper Guild of America Charles Dale 
the president and Charles Perlik immediate past president were 
unable to attend because of visa problems 
In prepared remarks for the meeting Dale said 
The Newspaper Guild takes this occasion to reaffirm its 
commitment to the freedom of Terry Anderson and the other 
journalists held hostage in the MiddleEast as well as the release 
of Arab journalists currently imprisoned in Israeli occupied 
territories 
We are approaching the third anniversary of Andersons 
imprisonement He and the other journalists who share his fate are 
prisoners without guilt sometimes to terms that now exceed those 
meted out to many violent criminals 
The conscience of the world cannot permit this to continue It 
cries out for the immediate freeing of Terry Anderson John 
McCarthy and JeanPaul Kauffmann not as part of any quid pro quo 
arrangement between governments but out of elementary consideration 
of human justice and decency In the same spirit we urge the 
release of all Arab journalists held in Israeli prisons he said
