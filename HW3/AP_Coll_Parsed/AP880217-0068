13 days which ended at noon Sunday will be submitted to the 
Guinness Book of World Records Pat Lewis said Tuesday

feet but was pronounced in good condition at a hospital Monday and 
then went to a hotel that donated a suite for his use in 
recuperating Ms Lewis said 
Hes feeling real well she said 
The 39yearold Pensacola Naval Air Station sailors 312 hours 
of knocking pins down would easily top the existing record of 217 
hours 55 minutes she said 
King was allowed five minutes off for each hour bowled but went 
the first four days without a break to accumulate time later used 
to get about two hours of sleep a night 
The current recordholder bowled 2028 games for an average of 
93 games per hour compared with Kings 2863 games and 92 hourly 
average Ms Lewis said 
Petty Officer Donnie Moore of the Jacksonville Naval Air 
Station set the present record breaking a mark of 168 hours 25 
minutes that King set in 1984 King is using the marathon attempt 
to raise money for Pensacolas Ninety and Nine Boys Ranch for 
abused children and Childrens America a missingchild registry 
and assistance group based in Largo

hoping the figure will increase to 10000 by the time all the 
checks are mailed She said pledges will be accepted for the next 
couple of days

A document purporting to announce a new 
state holiday honoring an Indian chief was a forgery and state 
employees should plan to show up for work Friday a spokesman for 
Gov Booth Gardner said 
There will be no state holiday to honor Indian Chief Leschi the 
governors press secretary Dick Milne said Tuesday 
Its a fairly elaborate scam someone is pulling here Milne 
said of the bogus proclamation which bore a slightly offcenter 
state seal The governors signature is an obvious forgery he 
said 
And its definitely not true that state employees local 
government workers and school children have the day off he 
stressed 
The forged memo praises the Nisqually chief the wise and 
generous Leschi who was treated most unjustly To honor this 
distinguished orator and arbiter is an essential cornerstone of our 
states history 
The memo says Friday is a state holiday and that when Feb 19 is 
on a weekend day it will be celebrated on a Friday or Monday 
We havent even been asked about designating the holiday or 
even to issue a proclamation in commemoration of the day Milne 
said 
Besides Milne said only the Legislature has the authority to 
proclaim a state holiday 
The governors office has no idea who forged the document Milne 
said adding that the culprit had a good knowledge of Indian 
history
