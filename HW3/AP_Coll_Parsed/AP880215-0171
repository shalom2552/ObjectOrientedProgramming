Opposition leaders on Monday 
challenged the lopsided vote totals that gave Gen Alfredo 
Stroessner his eighth straight term as president 
The ruling Colorado Partys final unofficial tally released 
Monday showed that Stroessner won 886 percent of the vote 
The partys count also showed a 74 percent absentee rate but 
opposition leaders contended that up to 40 percent of the 1446665 
eligible voters boycotted Sundays balloting 
Opposition leaders had urged voters to abstain and accused the 
ruling party of stuffing ballot boxes not providing opposition 
ballots failing to guarantee voting secrecy and allowing 
ineligible voters to cast ballots 
The 75yearold Stroessner the longestserving head of state in 
the Western Hemisphere has led Paraguay since a 1954 military coup 
The Colorado Party also won twothirds of the 72 house seats and 
36 senate seats The remaining onethird will be split 
proportionally between two participating opposition parties 
The Radical Liberal Party received 96231 votes or about 72 
percent the ruling party said The Liberal Party got 42056 or 
31 percent 
The party tally listed 8838 spoiled votes and 5627 blank 
ballots and said 107220 people did not vote Voting is obligatory 
for all citizens between 18 and 60 years old 
Miguel Abdon Saguir a vice president of the unrecognized 
Authentic Radical Liberal Party charged that voting booths were 
lacking in the majority of voting places and the vote was public 
and not secret polling officials handed out sealed envelopes with 
the official candidate list already inside and opposition parties 
had few or no observed overseers at the polls 
Luis Andrada Nogues secretarygeneral of the Christian 
Democrats also an unrecognized party told the Roman Catholic 
broadcast station Radio Caritas that the majority of polling places 
lacked opposition observers and in some cases no opposition ballots 
were provided 
As a result this is a de facto government he added 
Yesterdays elections were a joke and the Radical Liberal and 
Liberal parties allowed themselves to be used in a farce 
Stroessner on Sunday described the unrecognized opposition as 
liars Justice Minister Jose Eugenio Jacquet referred to them 
as insurrectionists and subversives 
Sabino Montanaro interior minister and party president said 
that the government plans to combat unemployment eliminate slums 
and shantytowns and promote domestic and foreign investment 
The Colorado Party ticket led by Stroessner garnered 1186693 
votes or 886 percent of the total the party said In 1983 
Stroessner won slightly more than 90 percent 
Spokesmen for the National Election Board which has a majority 
of Colorado Party members said final official vote totals probably 
would be available Tuesday
