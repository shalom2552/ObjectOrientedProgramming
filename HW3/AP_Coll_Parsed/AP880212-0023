The Kremlin accused the US State Department on 
Friday of spreading malicious slanders about human rights in 
the Soviet Union and said the United States has violations of its 
own 
The official news agency Tass carried an interview with Alexei 
Glukhov of the Foreign Ministry in which he discussed the State 
Departments annual report on human rights around the world 
The report released Wednesday in Washington said the Soviet 
government gave its people greater freedom and showed more 
tolerance toward dissenters in 1987 But it said an allpowerful 
secret police force remained unchecked 
Tass said the report again contains malicious slanders against 
the socialist countries including the USSR 
Glukhov first deputy head of the Foreign Ministrys Directorate 
for Humanitarian and Cultural Issues accused the State Department 
of making the allegations to speed up ratification of the 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons treaty which is making its way 
through the Senate 
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev signed 
the treaty in December 
The Soviet Union Glukhov noted conducted a prison amnesty and 
introduced new rules on emigration and immigration last year The 
State Department ignored these steps and relied on faulty 
information for its report he charged 
Much of the specific information contained in that report is 
clearly drawn from unclean sources he said citing what he said 
was an exaggerated figure of 400 political prisoners in the USSR 
Obviously the US State Department again lacks simple 
objectivity and simple truthfulness in the evaluations he said 
The Soviet Union would like to know why the United States has 
political prisoners sentences minors to death and prosecutes 
clergymen for antiwar activities Glukhov said 
The US side is far from the measure of openness and 
selfcriticism demonstrated by the Soviet Union on that issue he 
said referring to human rights 
Secretary of State George P Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A Shevardnadze are to discuss human rights at a meeting in 
Moscow on Feb 2123
