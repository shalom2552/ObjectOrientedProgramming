Sales at the Dallas Market Center softened with 
the Texas economy a few years ago but officials devised new 
marketing strategies that have begun paying off for this nationally 
known wholesale complex 
The Market Center a 150acre complex of wholesale showrooms 
contained in eight buildings typically draws 500000 buyers a 
year The center handles about 65 billion worth of wholesale 
orders annually 
Last year the number of buyers was down but the number of 
stores represented was up 
We look at two things when were talking about the number of 
buyers quality and quantity said Michael Parks president of 
the centers Hardgoods Division which includes furniture floor 
covering lighting jewelry and bathbedlinen industries 
In 1987 we had the healthiest year weve had in four years 
in the Hardgoods Division We held our own in the Southwest Our 
growth came out of the other regions of the country We have done a 
lot of marketing to those other regions 
Buyer attendance dropped 91 percent last year in the Softgoods 
division which includes mens womens and childrens apparel and 
related merchandise However the number of stores represented a 
crucial denominator increased 11 percent said division president 
Donna Knox 
Fortunately a number of years ago we redefined our strategy 
on attracting retailers to Dallas said Lucy Crow Billingsley 
chief executive officer of the Dallas Market Center 
Not only do we want to be what weve always been the best 
specialty store market in the country but we also want to expand 
geographically and reach much further than the 10state area next 
to us And weve done that 
Independent chains and small homeowned retailers have been the 
traditional base of the Dallas Market Centers buyers By 
implementing a new retail buyer development program complete with 
travel incentives retailers outside the Southwest and large 
departmentstore chains have become more aware of the Dallas Market 
Center 
In the soft goods area center workers compiled a list of 
retailers that do more than 1 million in annual sales but dont 
come to Dallas to buy That list had more than 12000 stores
