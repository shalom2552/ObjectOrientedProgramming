Pat Robertson says he has no firsthand 
evidence that there are Soviet missiles in Cuba as he had claimed 
in a debate over the weekend with his Republican presidential 
rivals 
Robertson came under fire Monday for the assertion made Sunday 
which fellow GOP candidates termed rash and outrageous 
The White House emphatically denied the claim and the man 
identified by the Robertson campaign as the candidates source said 
the existence of such weapons in Cuba has not been confirmed 
The former television evangelist initially said Monday that he 
would not back off his claim But later in the day he began 
revising it until he was saying that he had been asking a question 
not making an assertion when he alleged that Cuba has nuclear 
weapons pointed at the United States 
I was asking in the debate is this true he said I have 
no sources other than what Ive said so there was no categorial 
statement per se 
In the debate Robertson was attacking the intermediaterange 
missile treaty signed last December by President Reagan and Soviet 
Leader Mikhail S Gorbachev when he made the claim 
Somehow in all this brilliant negotiations which these 
gentlemen are so proud of they left that out of the treaty he 
said And it seems to me nukes pointing at the United States are 
more vital to our security than nukes pointing to Europe 
Pressed by reporters here Robertson said he had no firsthand 
evidence that there are such weapons in Cuba 
My contention is there might be missiles in the caves they 
may have brought in missiles on some other transport vessel or 
possibly a submarine I dont know the exact sizing of it but 
nobody can say for certain that those missiles arent there he 
said 
Later interviewed on Cable News Networks Larry King Live 
Robertson said it is possible there are Soviet missiles in Cuba 
I dont think frankly theres anybody in the United States 
right now that Im aware of who can say categorically that there 
are or theyre not there he said 
Earlier Monday Robertson had told a GOP candidates forum here 
that the least we can do in this is get those nuclear weapons out 
of Cuba a reiteration of the statements he had made during 
Sundays debate in Goffstown NH 
Im not going to back off from that Id be happy to have 
somebody prove me wrong he told an interviewer 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said SS4 and SS5 
missile sites established in Cuba in 1962 were confirmed as 
having been destroyed in that year We also are confident that the 
missiles were removed from Cuba at that time 
We have had extensive intelligence collection directed at Cuba 
since 1962 and have no evidence that SS4 SS5 or other strategic 
missiles have been deployed there Fitzwater said 
Asked whether he was denying any offensive nuclear weapons are 
deployed in Cuba Fitzwater said Exactly 
Vice President George Bush said in an interview Monday that 
Im confident this Robertson assertion is not true and 
added You keep hearing these outrageous charges which are 
designed to scare the American people 
Another GOP presidential candidate Rep Jack Kemp of New York 
called it a rather rash and unsupportable charge 
Officials with Robertsons campaign said his contention was 
based on information supplied by David S Sullivan a staff member 
of the Republican minority on the Democraticcontrolled Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee 
But Sullivan said Monday in an interview with The Associated 
Press that we do not know whether nuclear weapons are in Cuba or 
not
