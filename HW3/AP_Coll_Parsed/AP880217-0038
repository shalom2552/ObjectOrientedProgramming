George Bush the formal patrician 
Republican whose presidential bid had been thrown into sudden peril 
with a trouncing in Iowa stood in the lot at Cuzzin Richies 
truckstop 
This is the real me he insisted climbing into the cab of 
an 18wheeler This is my home turf 
It was three days after the vice president had been crushed in 
an embarrassing thirdplace finish in last weeks Iowa caucuses 
Bob Dole riding the wave out of Iowa was surging here in New 
Hampshire 
But then came the new George Bush and his new campaign With a 
Uturn in style and approach Bush came back and blunted Doles 
surge with a big victory in Tuesdays New Hampshire primary 
Bushs formidable organization swung into high gear The vice 
presidents association with President Reagan which had hurt him 
in Iowa proved a big plus here one that Bush milked for all it 
was worth 
And an eleventhhour advertising campaign attacking Dole and 
touting the support of Barry Goldwater helped bring him back from 
the edge of the abyss 
The vice president went from a 20point edge over Dole before 
Iowa to as much as 8 points behind But the tracking polls said 
Dole peaked about Friday the day the Bush campaign hit the 
airwaves with a new ad accusing Dole of straddling major issues 
In nearly final returns Tuesday Bush held a 9point margin over 
Bush 3829 
On the night of his big defeat in Iowa Bush seemed stunned 
Asked if his big entourage Secret Service protection and 
armslength style were getting in the way of reaching the people 
Bush answered that he wasnt sure 
Still shaky the next day Bush started before dawn to greet 
workers at a factory gate But few workers used that entrance and 
Bush spent a good portion of the time talking to reporters 
Then Bush tried out a new slogan Im one of you Born in 
New England and with a home in neighboring Maine Bush appealed to 
Granite State voters as his neighbors But he drifted away from the 
slogan which was too close to the Hes one of us theme Dole 
had used in Iowa 
Then 36 hours after Iowa New Hampshire voters saw the new 
George Bush 
Canceling a swing through the South Bush flew back in from his 
weekly lunch in Washington with President Reagan and went to the 
giant Pheasant Lane Shopping Mall in Nashua to shake hands late 
Wednesday 
Munching a chocolatechip cookie Bush shook hands with dozens 
of voters and heard some of them say he had their vote 
Thats good to hear he told one supporter Its a good 
morale booster 
With that gone were the formal events the speeches the town 
meetings with the carefully orchestrated crowds 
Now it was the informal George and impromptu campaign stops 
The first came at the East Coast Lumberyard in East Hampstead 
NH There in a casual coat and a cap Bush shook hands with 
customers and staff and drove a giant forklift around the yard It 
was all for the benefit of the media so the voters could see Bush 
mixing with people and doing everyday tasks 
Then it was onto Cuzzin Richies near Portsmouth on the 
seacoast He talked to truckers and drove a semirig around the 
block with a Secret Service man hanging off the mirror and the 
armored limousine right behind 
To go with the new freewheeling style were tough new ads hitting 
at Dole 
One labeled Dole as a man who had straddled the issues of taxes 
the INF treaty and an oil import fee 
Another a fiveminute electioneve buy featured Barry 
Goldwater known as Mr Conservative backing Bush Still another 
hit at Dole for backing a national economic commission 
That exists to provide political cover for a tax hike If it 
doesnt recommend a tax increase Ill not only eat my hat Ill 
eat Bob Doles hat Bush said in the ad 
Bush continued to campaign in malls and stores and nursing 
homes reaching out to people directly in the retail campaigning 
style that the state once insisted upon He brought baseball great 
Ted Williams to the state to add a celebrity touch to the final 
days 
All the while his wellrespected organization was cranking away 
at high speed focused on getting its 40000 potential supporters 
to the polls 
The final piece of the puzzle was Bush himself 
A private man in a public job Bush was forced to begin talking 
about himself not as a public official but as a person 
Mostly these days I think of Lincoln Here I stand warts 
and all he told a group of senior citizens in Portsmouth 
I have a tendency and I will confess to it to avoid going 
on and on with great eloquent statements of belief There may be 
better orators out there but nobody believes more strongly 
Maybe in some ways Im a little more taciturn than I could be 
he said 
I care too much to quit now So can you help me 
New Hampshire Republicans heard and heeded that plea
