A senior Panamanian diplomat broke with his 
countrys militarydominated government Friday declaring he could 
no longer in good conscience serve a regime stained by 
corruption illigitimacy and dishonesty 
Lawrence Chewning Fabrega minister counselor at Panamas 
mission to the Organization of American States here told a news 
conference his decision to resign was triggered by a speech he was 
ordered to give at an OAS ceremony on Wednesday 
Chewning had said in the speech that the Reagan administration 
was attempting to overthrow the Panamanian government and was 
waging a campaign of moral and economic aggresion against 
Panama 
These remarks were not written by me nor did they represent 
the way I feel or think Chewning said adding that they were 
prepared by Panamas ambassador to the OAS Roberto Leyton and the 
Panamanian Foreign Ministry 
Chewnings resignation followed an extraordinary week in which 
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega was indicted by two 
federal grand juries in Florida on drugrelated charges and was 
accused by former associates before a congressional panel of 
engaging in an array of corrupt activities 
Speaking through a translator at OAS headquarters Chewning 
said My conscience my dignity and my deep religious beliefs 
prevent me from continuing to be used as an instrument of a 
government characterized by corruption illigitimacy and 
dishonesty 
Panamas OAS mission had no statement on Chewnings resignation 
and Ambassador Leyton was not available for comment Gabriel Lewis 
a former Panamanian ambassador who has been lobbying in Washington 
against Noriegas rule said Chewnings resignation proves there 
are worthy individuals in the Panamanian government who refuse 
to continue supporting Noriega 
Chewning said he did not resign on the day of the OAS ceremony 
because he felt it was inappropriate given the nature of the 
event The occasion was the formal incorporation of West Germany 
into an international agreement designed to guarantee the 
neutrality of the Panama Canal once the waterway comes under 
Panamanian control in the year 2000 
In his speech Wednesday Chewning had said the United States in 
pursuing a hostile attitude toward the Panamanian government was 
attempting to evade its treaty pledge to relinquish control over 
the canal 
On Friday he said he believes the United States will faithfully 
comply with its commitments 
Chewning said he was not seeking political asylum in the United 
States and was confident he would not be the target of reprisals by 
the Panamanian government 
He will be ineligible to remain in this country because his visa 
allowing him to remain here is valid only so long as he maintained 
his status as a diplomat He said he has about a month to decide 
what to do in the future 
Chewning 46 served in the OAS post for a year and a half He 
previously had worked in Panamas Foreign Ministry its embassy in 
Belgium and its embassy in Washington accredited to the US 
government 
He and his wife are expecting their fourth child
