When former Congressman Jack Tanner arrives at a 
scenic New Hampshire farm for a photo opportunity the farmer 
chides him Are you my 1030 Youre late 
All along the crowded New Hampshire campaign trail Tanner 
played by Michael Murphy is constantly bumping into the other 
candidates Pat Robertson Gary Hart Bob Dole They play 
themselves 
All make cameo appearances in the premiere episode of HBOs new 
series Tanner 88 The Dark Horse making its debut tonight 
just in time for the New Hampshire primary The next episode will 
be aired in March 
The limitedrun series is a collaboration between director 
Robert Altman and cartoonist Garry Trudeau They have created a 
fictional presidential candidate surrounded him with a loyal staff 
and will follow his progress through the 1988 presidential campaign 
At one point in the first episode set in New Hampshire 
Tanners campaign manager TJ Cavanaugh Pamela Reed complains 
to the artsy filmmaker who produced the candidates video 
biography Deke if you use the term neorealism one more time 
 
Neorealism is in fact the term that springs to mind when 
describing the series reminiscent of both Medium Cool Haskell 
Wexlers 1969 quasidocumentary on the 1968 Democratic Convention 
and The Candidate Michael Ritchies 1972 film starring Robert 
Redford as a reluctant Mr Clean drafted to run for the US Senate 
But Tanner is mostly a reflection of Altman himself an 
early innovator in neorealism His Nashville and The 
Wedding broke new ground in filmmaking with improvised dialogue 
and their unflinching examinations of American morality 
Trudeau of course put politics on the funny pages with 
Doonesbury and Tanner gives him a vast new forum for 
political satire and commentary 
Between the two of them Altman and Trudeau have created a 
searingly insightful dramatization that could shed more light on 
the 1988 election process than any number of network commentators 
and newspaper columnists 
In episode one Tanner and his staff arrive in New Hampshire to 
find a state full of jaded mediawise voters who cringe at the 
thought of another candidacy even though Tanner is goodlooking 
likable competent and wellintentioned 
The premise of his candidacy is that since Joe Biden dropped out 
of the race Tanner has stepped in as the generational 
candidate the only one among the lot he says who can say without 
thinking which Beatle was his favorite 
Tanner gave up his Michigan congressional seat in the 1970s 
because his daughter had cancer Hes now divorced His daughter 
Alex played by Cynthia Nixon has long since recovered and is 
helping with the campaign 
Tanner did poorly in Iowa and arrived in New Hampshire with 
barely enough momentum to rent a seedy motel room and buy a few 
pizzas for volunteers The only news media interest in him consists 
of a lone Boston reporter doing a series of psychological profiles 
of the candidates 
When Tanners campaign film is shown to a test group of voters 
they hoot at its undraped sentimentality Theres hope though 
They react favorably to the candidate himself Its when the film 
seeks to manipulate them that they get turned off 
It could be the process itself says the media consultant 
Its tedious Its long What they may be resisting is another 
candidacy 
While the media consultant tries to figure out how to sell the 
candidate TJ is contending with phone calls from Joe Kennedy who 
apparently is trying to get her to help his own campaign Dont 
hang that on me she says at one point in the onesided 
conversation That was a victory party I was drunk and that was 
just a figure of speech 
After a depressing day of campaigning Tanner returns exhausted 
to the motel where a mystery woman is waiting for him and stops 
by the campaign office 
There the campaign filmmaker surreptitiously captures in 
redhot cinema verite Tanners unrehearsed but eloquent tirade on 
patriotism 
The campaigns new slogan Tanner For Real On to Super 
Tuesday
