A federal judge has turned down Federated Department Stores 
Incs request to dismiss Campeau Corps challenge of a Delaware 
antitakeover law while the federal government has indicated it 
might intervene in the case 
In another development Thursday Torontobased Campeau disclosed 
more financing details for a proposed 54 billion merger with 
Cincinnatibased Federated The merger was offered as an 
alternative to its outstanding 42 billion hostile tender offer 
We believe that the Federated board cannot consistent with 
its fiduciary responsibilities to stockholders continue to refuse 
to meet with us Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau said in a letter 
to Federated Chairman Howard Goldfede 
Federated had no comment on Campeaus renewed offer Federated 
spokesman Jim Sluzewski said 
The Securities and Exchange Commission submitted a brief 
Thursday supporting Campeaus right to challenge the Delaware 
statute The SEC also indicated it might express an opinion on the 
merits of the suit itself 
US District Judge Leonard B Sand in New York had asked the 
SEC for comment on Federateds motion to dismiss Campeaus suit 
Federated which is incorporated in Delaware contended Campeau had 
no standing to make the constitutional challenge because it did not 
have assured financing for its hostile takeover bid 
But the SEC indicated the substantial efforts and 
expenditures undertaken by a party making a tender offer 
satisfied the requirement that a party have a personal stake in 
an issue in order to have standing to sue 
The brief also stated Campeau could suffer substantial 
injury if forced to wait for assurance of financing before 
pressing its lawsuit and such assurance would do little or nothing 
to clarify the constitutional issues in the case 
Campeau challeged the takeover law as an unconstitutional 
interference with interstate commerce and an infringement on 
federal regulatory authority 
The law is regarded as significant because of the thousands of 
major companies that have incorporated in Delaware Black amp Decker 
Corp which has a 203 billion hostile offer outstanding for 
American Standard Inc also has challenged the law 
Eric Summergrad the SEC assistant general counsel said in 
Washington the agencys staff also was considering a similar 
friend of the court brief addressing the actual issues raised 
by the suit He said a decision on whether to file such a brief 
should be made in the next two weeks 
Campeau also has filed suit to challenge Federateds poison 
pill takeover defense but that issue was not addressed by the 
SEC brief issued Thursday 
Federated shares jumped 237 to 5987 a share Thursday on 
the New York Stock Exchange 
Campeau further disclosed that it had financing commitments for 
200 million of a planned 500 million bank loan being arranged by 
Bank of Montreal and Banque Paribas and a commitment for a 100 
million shortterm bridge loan from First Boston Corp First 
Boston also indicated it was highly confident it could raise up to 
1 billion in subordinated debt to finance the merger 
Campeau said in his letter to Goldfeder that Security Pacific 
National Bank in Los Angeles has committed 500 million to the deal 
and has advised us that it is highly confident that commitments 
can be obtained for the balance of the required financing 
Campeau on Wednesday disclosed it had agreements for 660 
million in financing for its 54 billion offer Federated has said 
it would discuss that offer which was applicable only in a 
definitive merger agreement if Campeau showed it had enough 
financing to complete the buyout 
Ohio shopping center developer Edward J DeBartolo who helped 
finance Campeaus 34 billion buyout of Allied Stores Corp in 
1986 agreed to lend 400 million The Reichmann family of Toronto 
which controls Olympia amp York Developments Ltd a major Campeau 
shareholder agreed to buy 260 million in new Campeau shares 
Federated operates approximately 650 stores nationwide and had 
sales exceeding 11 billion in 1987 
Federateds holdings include the New York chains Bloomingdales 
and Abraham and Straus Filenes of Boston Burdines of Miami 
Richs in Atlanta Bullocks and Bullocks Wilshire in Los Angeles
