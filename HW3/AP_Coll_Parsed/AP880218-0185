A 9yearold boy who survived almost 40 
minutes under water in an icecovered pond walked out of the 
hospital Wednesday and doctors said he had made almost a complete 
recovery from his neardrowning five weeks earlier 
Kendall Smith was in a coma for two weeks after he fell through 
the ice Jan 12 near his Dillon home in northeastern South 
Carolina But doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina 
Hospital said he progressed rapidly once he recovered consciousness 
Were all humbled as caretakers to see what many of us would 
consider if not miraculous a nearmiraculous recovery said Dr 
Fred Tecklenburg one of Kendalls attending physicians 
I thank God for giving everyone the knowledge and skills to do 
what theyve done for my child Its a miracle said the boys 
mother Mary 
Kendall received parting gifts of a new electronic musical 
keyboard and a bicyle He and family members met with reporters 
prior to his release 
Asked how he felt Kendall shyly said Good and agreed that 
while he would have to return to school he wasnt quite ready to 
do so 
Smiling brightly the youth wearing black jeans with suspenders 
a bluestriped shirt and a white hat evoked laughter from 
reporters and hospital workers as the keyboard suddenly sounded a 
syncopated rhythm I dont know how to play this thing he said 
with a laugh 
Tecklenburg said the keyboard was an appropriate gift because 
the first time the youth opened his eyes after the accident it was 
to the sound of a similar keyboard 
Kendall was playing with two companions on the frozen surface of 
a pond when the ice gave way His two friends were rescued quickly 
from the water but it took rescuers almost 40 minutes to fish 
Kendall out using grappling hooks 
Tecklenburg said Kendall is one of only about five children in 
the medical literature to have been under water for more than 30 
minutes and recovered completely 
In icy water the bodys metabolism slows and the brain doesnt 
need as much oxygen The reflex is particularly powerful in 
children doctors say 
Tecklenburg said Kendall tested at his age level on several 
standardized tests administered about 10 days ago 
Kendall has very minimal disabilities said Dr Karen 
Powers another physician who treated the youth 
She said he may start out going to only a half day of school to 
allow his endurance to build up and said he may be seen by a speech 
therapist if needed 
Mrs Smith said that during her sons recovery everybody kept 
telling me to keep the faith and dont give up All I could do is 
keep praying 
Cards and letters for Kendall were sent from throughout the 
nation and Tecklenburg called it a tribute to our country that so 
many people have been concerned about Kendall
