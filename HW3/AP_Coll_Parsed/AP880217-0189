With the biggest primary day in history three 
weeks away presidential campaigns are hoarding their cash and 
searching for more to pay for campaigning and television 
advertising time in the 20 Super Tuesday states 
Sen Paul Simon said bluntly on Wednesday that his presidential 
campaign cannot continue unless he draws more money By contrast 
wellheeled Democrat Michael Dukakis has 4 million available for 
the most pivotal date of the 1988 primary season on March 8 
Rep Jack Kemp straining for the Republican nomination against 
betterfunded opponents said his campaign is in the black and 
counting on his thirdplace showing in New Hampshire to help boost 
fund raising 
Rep Richard Gephardt DMo who relied on this years federal 
matching funds to pay off sizable debts said Wednesday that money 
is not a problem for him at this point 
Were raising money at a good clip he said 
Gephardt will need a good influx to remain competitive with 
Dukakis the governor of Massachusetts and Sen Albert Gore Jr 
DTenn in the South 
Gore is not as flush as Dukakis but has already has a big media 
jump on his opponents thanks to his strategy of concentrating on 
the South while his opponents vied on the battlefields of Iowa and 
New Hampshire 
Last week Gore launched a 1 millionplus TV campaign across the 
country 
We will outspend every other candidate toward Super Tuesday 
deputy press secretary Paul Risley said He declined to give an 
overall spending figure but said said the campaign has 22 
million in cash on hand and intends to spend a minimum of up to 3 
million on media alone toward Super Tuesday 
He said the current Gore commercials featuring a biographical 
message are running in 14 South and border states and nationwide 
on Cable News Network and other cable stations 
Dukakis who has concentrated considerable resources on the 
delegaterich Super Tuesday states of Florida and Texas has 4 
million in the bank deputy press secretary Steven Akey said 
Wednesday He said the campaigns media buys had not been decided 
yet for Super Tuesday but that several fundraising events are 
scheduled and We have the resources to go the distance 
Despite Simons successful fundraising events in Boston and in 
New York last week where 140000 was raised on the heels of his 
secondplace finish in Iowa caucuses his campaign has debts of 
nearly 500000 said his press secretary Terry Michael 
I have to win either in South Dakota or Minnesota and we have 
to get additional campaign contributions Those two things have to 
be there otherwise Im going to have to withdraw Simon said 
Simon spokesman David Carle later tried to paint the financial 
picture more positively 
He said Simon hoped to raise 150000 at four events in Chicago 
on Wednesday night Another event was planned Thursday morning in 
St Louis and a very very good response was coming from the 
48000 solicitation telegrams the campaign sent out to capitalize 
on the Iowa results he said 
These two weeks are shaping up to be recordbreaking for the 
campaign in terms of money Carle said estimating a total of up 
to 600000 might be raised 
Babbitt who is to announce Thursday whether he will continue 
his struggling presidential bid will end up about 150000 to 
200000 in debt if he drops out now said his press spokesman Vada 
Manager 
He said the campaign has about 30000 in cash on hand and that 
contributions slowed to a trickle after Babbitts poor showing 
in the Iowa caucuses last week 
After New Hampshire its going to be worse he said 
On the Republican side Kemp ended the year seriously in debt 
but said his campaign has raised 300000 a week for the past five 
weeks and is now operating in the black thanks also to some 39 
million in federal matching funds he received since Jan 1 
He said he intends to hit up his list of 110000 contributors in 
a fundraising push for Super Tuesday 
Super Tuesday could mean budgetwatching of a different type 
with the wellheeled Vice President George Bush Sen Bob Dole and 
former TV evangelist Pat Robertson budgeting to keep spending low 
enough so they can save their big cash caches for states that come 
later 
Bush has raised 204 million so far and has a series of 
fundraisers scheduled to reach the campaigns goal of 33 million 
said treasurer Fred Bush Although the campaigns are limited by law 
to 27 million in overall primary campaign spending legal and 
accounting costs are exempted from the limit 
Bush with 8 million in the bank is not worried about the cap 
however said spokeswoman Ede Holiday Although he had spent more 
than 13 million by the end of the year only 79 million was 
applicable against the ceiling 
Dole was wellsituated with 41 million in available cash and 
no outstanding debts said campaign spokesman Tim Archie 
Pat Robertson on the other hand had spent 124 million 
against the cap and Dole spent 95 million against it by the end 
of 1987 
Wellfunded campaigns must budget carefully so they can spend 
enough on the later states without going over the 27 million limit
