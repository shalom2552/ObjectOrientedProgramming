Runza fastfood restaurants have something 
McDonalds Burger King and Wendys dont cabbage and a cult 
following 
The chain offers hamburgers french fries and other traditional 
fast foods but its the Runza sandwich thats the staple at Runza 
DriveInns of America 
The Runza a mixture of ground beef cabbage and onion in an 
oblong loaf of dough is available only in Nebraska and three 
neighboring states But its following is devoted 
ExNebraskans living in New York are known to order several 
dozen Runzas with cheese and Italian variations when they hold 
their Taste of Nebraska parties in the Big Apple 
New customers often react with disbelief when they learn that 
cabbage is a main ingredient in the Runza says chain chief Don 
Everett 
Ninety percent of the people who dont like cabbage normally 
like the product Everett said I say to people If you dont 
like it Ill give you your money back or Ill buy you a 
hamburger 
Everett apparently shells out few refunds because his 
Lincolnbased chain sold about 15 million worth of Runzas last 
year at its 42 restaurants in Nebraska Iowa Kansas and Colorado 
Its franchises have reported overall sales increases every year 
since Runza DriveInns of America was incorporated in 1966 Everett 
said But the Runzas roots stretch back to 18thcentury Russia 
Germans who were invited to settle in the Volga region by 
Czarina Catherine the Great in 1763 developed the Runza or bierock 
said Ruth Amen of the American Historical Society of Germans from 
Russia 
A century later many of the Germans migrated from Russia to the 
Americas because of a change in Russian leadership 
Our people when they came from Russia brought the Runza with 
them she said I cant say and I dont think anyone can say 
whether they picked them up from the Russian people 
Everett picked up the Runza from his mother Sarah Sally 
Everett who learned how to bake Runzas from her mother on a farm 
near Sutton 
Mrs Everetts brother Alex Brening and her brotherinlaw 
Milan Everett found themselves looking for work shortly after 
World War II With an investment of about 500 the three opened 
the first Runza restaurant in 1950 
Mrs Everett and Brening still own the original Runza but they 
sold the trade name rights to Don Everett in 1966 
A subsidiary Runza National has franchised 42 of the 
restaurants Everett said Thirtysix of the restaurants are in 
Nebraska Three are in Kansas two in Iowa and one in Colorado 
Everett a major stockholder in about half the restaurants has 
enough franchise applications on file to expand the chain rapidly 
But he said Runza DriveInns will only grow as quickly as qualified 
owners and managers are found 
We have more than 1400 applications but we dont give them 
serious consideration because they dont have qualified managers to 
send here for training he said 
If a franchise application receives initial approval the 
applicant or a designated store manager must come to Runzas 
Lincoln headquarters for 50 hours of training 
The franchise is not awarded until the training period which 
includes working in Runza restaurants is successfully completed 
Everett said 
Kathi Krause started working at Everetts first Runza DriveInn 
in 1972 at age 16 as a 1 per hour carhop Today shes a major 
stockholder in nine Runza restaurants 
In states other than Nebraska Mrs Krause admits Runzas can be 
a hard sell 
Its kind of been a wordofmouth recipe that people in 
Nebraska have really grown accustomed to she said Outside 
Nebraska weve had to work a little harder to let people know what 
they are
