Supporters of George Bush are 
claiming an overwhelming victory in a Republican straw poll but 
Bob Doles backers boycotted the vote and say theyll win when it 
counts on primary election day 
Bush garnered 731 votes while Dole got 32 in the presidential 
straw poll which Bush supporters denounced as illegal 
This proves that Puerto Rico is George Bush country said 
Josito Dapena Bushs campaign director for Puerto Rico 
Dole supporters minimized the importance of the poll which is 
not binding saying the real test is March 20 when Puerto Rico 
holds its primary 
We dont participate in straw polls said Donald Devine a 
proDole observer at the assembly 
There was a bitter dispute when GOP National Committeeman Edison 
Misla Aldarondo a Dole backer tried to address the gathering to 
question whether there was a quorum He was told he had not 
registered as a delegate and could not speak 
Luis A Ferre the local GOP chairman said the presence of 750 
of the 1500 delegates in the general assembly would constitute a 
quorum Dole supporters said there were only 682 delegates 
registered but the Bush forces said more than 900 attended 
The Dole campaign in Washington issued a statement saying Bush 
backers had failed in an attempt to convene and illegally 
poll Puerto Rico Republicans 
Mondays assembly was originally scheduled to chose the 14 
delegates to the Republican convention instead of waiting for March 
20 However the local Democratic Party went to court to prevent 
the primary from being advanced 
Bushs national campaign manager Lee Atwater said the Puerto 
Rico results would give the vice president a lift going into the 
New Hampshire primary and also send a positive signal to other 
Hispanic voters throughout the United States
