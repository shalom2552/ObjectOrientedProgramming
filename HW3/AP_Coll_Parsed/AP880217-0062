in a campaign marked by few clashes but their rhetoric showed 
signs of heating up Tuesday night 
Schreiber promised he would tell voters how Norquists campaign 
statements differed from past votes in the Wisconsin Senate on 
issues affecting Milwaukee 
Norquist asked how he differed from his opponent replied 
Id be the kind of mayor that would make a decision and stick 
with it I think the city wants a strong leader

Schreiber 44984 votes or just over 44 percent and Norquist 
40575 votes or just over 40 percent

country and more than 40 percent of the citys black children live
