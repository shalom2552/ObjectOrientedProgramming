Gov Evan Mechams impeachment trial is 
embroiled in controversy even before it begins with disputes over 
closed state Senate meetings and whether the trial should be 
delayed 
The Senate is scheduled to begin hearing testimony Feb 22 but 
Mechams lawyer says he wants the trial put off until after the 
governor stands trial on separate criminal charges 
Senate leaders are being criticized by the news media for having 
decided to hold closed meetings periodically during the impeachment 
trial The first closed meeting was held Thursday minutes after 
the senators were sworn in as trial judges 
Part of the confusion according to state Sen Greg Lunn is 
that Arizona senators arent used to acting as judges and jurors 
instead of lawmakers 
We dont do this very often said Lunn who was one of the 
Republican governors earliest critics in the party Certainly 
impeaching a governor is an unprecedented situation in this state 
Everyone feels the burden 
Mecham was impeached Feb 5 by the House on 23 separate articles 
alleging that he concealed a 350000 campaign loan misused 
80000 from the governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership and tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death 
threat by a state official 
Twothirds of the 30 Senate votes are required to convict him A 
conviction would automatically remove him from office and the 
Senate could bar him from holding any political office in the 
future 
Mecham also faces a March 9 criminal trial on six felony charges 
involving the 350000 loan And he faces a May 17 recall election 
in which he plans to run probably against a number of opponents 
Mechams lawyer Murray Miller said he will file a motion this 
week asking that the Senate trial be delayed until after the 
criminal case on grounds the impeachment trial could endanger 
Mechams constitutional right to a fair trial in criminal court 
You know in some countries theyd call it a coup Mecham 
told cheering supporters Saturday in Glendale But in this state 
its not going to work 
About 2000 Mecham supporters attended the fundraising picnic 
many paying 1 to take whacks with a sledgehammer at a battered car 
labeled with the words Media Bias Special Interest Groups 
Hidden Government and Selective Prosecution 
If the Senate rejects the motion to delay the impeachment trial 
Miller said he may take the matter to court adding that he 
believes courts have jurisdiction in such cases 
But Senate President Carl Kunasek a Republican disagreed 
I would be interested in finding the judge that would do 
that Kunasek said Its called the separation of powers I do 
believe 
Miller said he will probably also bring a motion challenging the 
sufficiency of the impeachment articles an effort to get a 
Senate vote on whether the allegations in the articles of 
impeachment warrant a trial 
Miller also doesnt like the Senates decision to hold closed 
meetings 
Majority Leader Bob Usdane a Republican said the meetings are 
intended to permit lawmakers to consult with their lawyers discuss 
which witnesses should be called and go over questions 
Usdane said the senators also could conduct final deliberations 
behind closed doors before voting on whether to convict Mecham 
In Thursdays meeting senators hashed out final details on 
procedural rules for the trial The rules then were adopted on the 
floor with no debate 
Kunasek promised that the trial itself will be held in the open 
And Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens a Democrat contended the 
issue was being blown out of proportion by the media since the 
final vote will be public 
Each and every member will be on the verge of tears or 
whatever because were going to have the same traumatic 
decision that was made in the House Stephens said 
Lunn said he thinks closed meetings fuel unnecessary controversy 
The only issue should be whether Evan Mecham should be 
impeached in light of the facts and the law Lunn said By having 
closed meetings the Senate will play into Millers hands by giving 
him something to criticize he said 
Rep Mark Killian a Republican who cried during the House 
impeachment vote when he bitterly criticized the governor but voted 
against impeaching him said he thought the Senate should have 
closed meetings only when consulting with attorneys 
Otherwise Killian said If hes convicted everyone will say 
Well they were scheming to convict the governor or if hes 
acquitted theyll say They were scheming to acquit him 
The trial is becoming expensive House special counsel William 
French already has been paid 200000 to 250000 for conducting 
the investigation that led to the impeachment 
Additional fees for French and the other House counsel Paul 
Eckstein and for their assistants could go over 100000 House 
leaders say The Senate has hired a lawyer John Lundin at 175 an 
hour 
Mecham is the 16th governor impeached in US history If he is 
convicted he will be the seventh to be removed from office by an 
impeachment conviction 
He would be succeeded by Secretary of State Rose Mofford a 
Democrat who is acting governor pending the impeachment trials 
outcome
