Angola has rejected a South African 
proposal for a regional peace conference that would include Angolan 
rebels Angolas official ANGOP news agency reported Friday 
It quoted a government statement as saying Angola was prepared 
to hold direct peace talks with South Africa if that country 
rejected the United States as a mediator 
But the Marxist government rejected any negotiations that would 
include rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola UNITA according to the report monitored in Lisbon 
It quoted the statement as saying The reference to the 
participation of UNITA removes all credibility from the South 
African governments proposal 
It also claimed the proposal was a maneuver aimed at gaining 
time to increase South African military pressure on government 
forces in southern Angola 
President PW Botha of South Africa said last month he was 
willing to participate in a regional meeting to resolve conflicts 
in southern Africa and that UNITA should be represented 
Botha has not specifically proposed a peace conference or put 
forward any concrete suggestions 
Anticommunist UNITA guerrillas have been battling the 
government since the Marxists gained power following Angolas 
independence from Portugal in 1975 
The rebels are backed by South Africa and receive aid from the 
United States An estimated 40000 Cuban military personnel and 
Soviet advisers are helping the government forces 
South African troops have made frequent incursions into southern 
Angola from neighboring SouthWest Africa also known as Namibia 
Angola in its statement that rejected any talks with UNITA 
said it would be coherent and logical to include in a regional 
conference the SouthWest African Peoples Organization SWAPO and 
the African National Congress 
The African National Congress is the main rebel movement 
fighting South Africas whiteled government and SWAPO is a black 
guerrilla group fighting for independence for Namibia which is 
administered by South Africa 
ANGOP quoted the Angolan statement as saying the main causes of 
confict in the region are South Africas illegal occupation of 
Namibia South African attacks against its blackruled neighbors 
and its alleged creation of armed groups to carry out terrorist 
activities in those countrie and the denial of political rights 
to the black majority in South Africa 
Later Friday the Angolan Embassy in Lisbon issued a statement 
denying reports published in Portugal that representatives of the 
Angolan government and UNITA would hold peace talks this summer in 
Lisbon
