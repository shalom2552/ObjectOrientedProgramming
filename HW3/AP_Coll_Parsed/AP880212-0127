A FrancoBelgian deal to keep a 
restructured Societe Generale de Belgique SA in Belgian hands fell 
through Friday and revitalized a bid by Italian investor Carlo De 
Benedetti to take effective control of the nations biggest holding 
company 
Belgian industrialist Andre Leysen failed to get the necessary 
backing from a group of mostly Belgian shareholders to approve a 
deal with the French holding Cie Financiere de Suez to take control 
of Societe Generale 
Leysen said in a statement he considered his mandate as 
spokesman for the group as over He added he would not take new 
initiatives in the fight for control of the company that has a 
stake in a third of the Belgian economy 
De Benedetti is trying to get effective control of Societe 
Generale and use it as a platform for a panEuropean financial 
holding company 
The Italian investor claims to be the largest single shareholder 
and can control through allies 38 percent of stock in the 
company He has a public offer for 15 percent more 
The 166yearold Societe Generale has interests in about 1400 
companies worldwide with assets totaling nearly 3 billion 
The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around Leysen said 
it had 28 percent of stocks in the company while Suez claimed 15 
percent 
But together with various small allies Leysen said the bloc 
would have been assured of absolute majority at shareholders 
meetings 
The accord was also favored by the current management of Societe 
Generale which has come under sharp attack by De Benedetti 
Even before Fridays rejection of the LeysenSuez deal De 
Benedetti had offered to cooperate with Belgian shareholders in 
restructuring Societe Generale with a Belgian as chief officer and 
himself running the daytoday management 
De Benedetti did not extend the offer for cooperation to Suez 
however 
A shareholder can block management decisions when he has 25 
percent of Societe Generale stock 
Fridays developments followed a week of frantic negotiations 
between the three interested parties and threatened to defeat De 
Benedettis bid to take control of the company 
Suez meanwhile said in Paris it would continue to negotiate with 
Belgian shareholders despite Leysens withdrawal 
Suez said in a statement the group is continuing discussions 
with all the Belgian shareholders that have expressed their desire 
to build a balanced partnership with us
