The odds are increasing rapidly that Americans 
traveling abroad can find a fastfood place that bears a familiar 
name 
McDonalds in Munich Pizza Hut in Fiji and Taco Bell in 
Sydney are just three examples of the trend toward expanding 
foreign markets for US restaurant fanchises says an 
Agriculture Department report 
In 1985 there were 6122 international franchise units up 36 
percent from 3943 in 1980 Figures by the Commerce Department show 
that Canada and Japan account for almost half with Australia and 
New Zealand ranking next 
The report was written for the departments National Food Review 
magazine by two economists Charlene Price and Hal Linstrom of 
USDAs Economic Research Service 
As you might expect the popularity of the different 
restaurants varied around the world the report said For 
example Canada was the largest market for hamburger units and 
Japan accounted for the greatest share of the chicken market 
Austalians and New Zealanders enjoyed pizza 
McDonalds Kentucky Fried Chicken Burger King and Wendys the 
four largest US restaurant chains accounted for 31 percent of 
the world total franchising 4626 restaurants internationally by 
1986 up from 272 in 1974 the report said 
As the largest food service organization in the world with about 
9400 establishments McDonalds led the international scene with 
about 2138 outlets compared with 370 five years earlier the 
report said 
Kentucky Fried Chicken a division of PepsiCo Inc operated 
more than 6500 units including 1854 in 54 foreign countries 
Burger King part of Pillsbury Foodservice operated 4744 
outlets in 1986 including 403 in 24 foreign countries and Puerto 
Rico 
Wendys which grew to the worlds fourthlargest restaurant 
chain in 17 years operated almost 4000 outlets including 231 in 
17 foreign countries 
Of the four largest franchisers only Kentucky Fried Chicken 
operated outlets in Africa in 1986 and also held sole position in 
the Middle Eastern countries the report said 
Franchise growth overseas will continue in existing markets 
the report said At the same time some chains are entering 
previously untapped areas Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut 
for instance recently negotiated with the Chinese and Russian 
governments to bring fast food to those countries 
Most franchise restaurant companies probably will keep expanding 
their menus and services abroad as well as in the United States 
particularly to meet a growing interest in diet and light foods 
Strong growth in Mexican and oriental foods may also mean 
introduction of new menu items the report said Following the 
US trend breakfast offerings are also likely to increase in 
overseas restaurants

A shot or two of carbon dioxide the stuff 
used in some fire extinguishers may be just the thing to help 
sensitive plants such as raspberries and blueberries survive the 
stress of heat therapy says an Agriculture Department plant 
pathologist 
The result one day could be a new assortment of plants for 
nurseries and home gardeners 
Heat is used in special chambers to rid fruit and vegetable 
plants of viruses At 100 degrees Fahrenheit the heat forces the 
plants to grow faster than the viruses lurking in them said 
Richard H Converse who works for the departments Agricultural 
Research Service Corvallis Ore 
But thats too hot for blueberries and many raspberries he said 
in a recent report by the agency If carbon dioxide is raised to 
1100 parts per million in the chamber from the 350 parts normally 
present in the air the plants are able to withstand the heat 
Converse said the process of raising carbon dioxide levels had 
been used previously by Australian scientists to heattreat grape 
plants He is hopeful that the procedure can be used to eliminate 
viruses from apples oranges potatoes onions and bulb crops such 
as iris and lilies

Poultry processors soon will be allowed more 
options in repackaging and relabeling federally inspected fowl and 
poultry products for final distribution to consumer outlets says 
the Agriculture Department 
As it is right now poultry products can only be repacked and 
relabeled at federally inspected plants 
Warehouses and distribution centers are often more 
conveniently located than federally inspected plants said Lester 
M Crawford administrator of the departments Food Safety and 
Inspection Service So allowing certain facilities to repackage 
and relabel poultry products with inspectors present means savings 
in time and money and a safe product We believe the savings in 
transportation costs could ultimately mean lower prices for 
consumers 
The optional operations will also have to be done under the 
supervision of federal inspectors he said The new rule will take 
effect on March 11 
The processors will pay USDA for the inspection at the 
repackaging operations Crawford said the optional service has been 
available to the meat industry but has not been allowed under 
poultry inspection regulations 
Repacking and relabeling allow bulk shipments of federally 
inspected products to be divided into consumer packages and to have 
brand names placed on the products
