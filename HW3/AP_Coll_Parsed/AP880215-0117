Relations among the three surviving Beatles have 
improved but Paul McCartney is too moody to allow any joint 
performances to take place George Harrison said Monday 
Our relationship is quite good but theres no reunion of any 
Beatles he told reporters after returning from Los Angeles We 
have been having dinner together We are friends now the first 
time we have been this close for a long time But it doesnt mean 
to say that we are going to make another group or anything 
Harrison has had hits recently in Britain and the United States 
McCartney also has had a successful solo career but Ringo Starrs 
last album in 1985 was considered too hohum for issue 
On his feelings towards McCartney Harrison said I am more 
friendly with other musicians Paul is a bit too moody for me 
Anyway there will never be a Beatles concert because theres only 
three of them left
