A union official whose cooperation was 
considered crucial to saving the New York Post boycotted 
labormanagement negotiations Wednesday with a deadline for 
closing the paper two days away 
Jerry Cronin president of the 350member drivers union did 
not join the negotiations Both sides had said agreement was 
impossible without the cooperation of his union 
Late in the day the Post announced that arbitrator Thomas G 
Christensen a labor law professor at New York University had 
denied a petition by the drivers union to stop the paper from 
closing Feb 19 
The union argued that the Post was required by contract to give 
30 days notice of any change in work rules Rubenstein said 
Christensen decided that the rule did not apply if the paper was 
closing 
The newspaper hopes that the drivers will now work with them 
in reaching an agreement said Howard Rubenstein a spokesman for 
the Post 
Cronin could not be reached for comment 
Earlier labor lawyer Theodore W Kheel who is advising the 
newspapers union had said theres no chance of a settlement 
before Friday 
The talks between management and nine Post unions at the Grand 
Hyatt Hotel were scheduled to continue around the clock until the 2 
pm Friday deadline set by Post owner Rupert Murdoch who has 
demanded 24 million in union concessions over three years 
After meeting for 35 minutes both sides broke for lunch and 
consultations George McDonald president of the Allied Printing 
Trades Council said they had discussed the concession figure and 
told reporters I feel optimistic We all had smiles in there I 
think 
If the unions refuse to go along with the concessions Murdoch 
has said his 37 million sale of the paper to real estate developer 
Peter Kalikow will collapse and the paper will close 
Participants in the talks included Post publisher Patrick 
Purcell and other Post executives McDonald and leaders from most 
of the eight unions which constitute the trades council 
Purcell had no comment after the brief meeting 
One union leader Lenny Higgins of the pressmens union said 
one goal was to extend the deadline If he Murdoch stays with 
the Friday deadline I dont know whatll happen he said 
Under the terms of his contract with Kalikow Murdoch has until 
Monday to negotiate the union concessions 
Murdoch opted to sell the Post after Congress passed legislation 
preventing crossownership of a newspaper and a television station 
in the same city Murdoch also owns WNYWTV in New York He faces a 
similar crossownership situation in Boston 
Murdoch claims he has lost nearly 150 million since purchasing 
the Post 11 years ago
