President Reagan and Mexican President 
Miguel de la Madrid met in this sundrenched resort Saturday 
stressing positive relations but acknowledging sharp differences 
over Central America policy and illegal drug trafficking 
De la Madrid at a luncheon with Reagan complained that 
Mexicos efforts to curb drug production and trafficking are 
still not appreciated to their full extent and are the target of 
disinformation 
He said it was unlikely that any country devoted as much 
resources to the fight as Mexico 
In a pointed reference to the United States de la Madrid said 
the battle against drugs cannot be won unless drug consumption is 
attacked with the same vigor as the fight against production and 
trafficking 
Although about 25 percent of the Mexican army is engaged in the 
antidrug campaign the United States says the effort is not enough 
is hampered by official corruption and that the flow of drugs is 
increasing 
Reagan in his luncheon remarks said The people in the 
United States are now turning away from drugs and that 
development should curb the demand that fuels the trafficking 
The two leaders held private talks in a seaside hotel in 
Mazatlan which is in the state of Sinaloa the main center for 
Mexicos illegal drug trade Following the fourhour meeting 
Reagan was flying to California for a fournight stay at his Santa 
Barbara ranch 
The leaders conferred privately for 45 minutes with only 
notetakers present Reagan told de la Madrid that Mexico has been 
very cooperative in fighting drugs but urged him to work harder 
This is the year we have to show results Reagan told the 
Mexican leader according to a White House statement 
Reagan pronounced himself extremely pleased with our 
discussions and the remarkable record of achievements of their 
talks 
As they posed for pictures Reagan was asked if he agreed with 
de la Madrid that drug use was the root of the whole problem It 
always has been Reagan replied 
Elliott Abrams assistant secretary of state for interAmerican 
affairs told reporters on Air Force One there was a serious 
possibility the United States would find that Mexico should 
remain eligible for aid from international financial institutions 
even though its drug program falls somewhat short 
A firm opponent Reagans campaign to fund the Contra rebels in 
Nicaragua de la Madrid called for negotiated settlements in 
Central America that take into account the legitimate and 
essential interests of the parties in conflict with a sense of 
fairness and evenhandedness 
He said peace would be possible only if all the governments of 
Central America comply with the commitments that they have made 
at the highest level 
For his part Reagan said our commitment to democracy in our 
hemisphere must be unshakeable 
He said totalitarian systems in the Soviet Union Cuba and 
Nicaragua have demonstrated for all to see that tyranny doesnt 
work Mexico and the United States have a common interest in 
stable free and democratic governments in this hemisphere 
He expressed hopes for a common USMexican stand against the 
expansion of totalitarianism 
The White House statement said Reagan in his private talks 
underscored his support for the Contras and repeated his 
commitment to the peace process It quoted de la Madrid as saying 
Mexico is supportive of the fournation peace accord signed in 
Guatemala 
Later at a briefing for reporters Secretary of State George 
Shultz said that while differences over Central America were 
discussed there were no heated words Asked whether the two 
sides had come closer on the subject he said that was not a 
particular focus of the talks 
Asked if Mexico should do more to combat drugs Shultz said 
Yes and so does the United States So do we all Its a 
tremendous problem 
In his luncheon remarks de la Madrid said Mexicos huge foreign 
debt 105 billion continues to be one of the major obstacles 
to development in my country 
He said there is an urgent need to find new formulas to 
adjust debt servicing to the capacity of debtor countries to pay 
and to permit them to boost growth and recover their living 
standards which have been so greately affected by this long 
crisis 
Reagan said there is reason for optimism on the debt 
problem He said Mexicos plan to exchange some of its debt for 
special bonds which are backed by US zero coupon bonds was an 
innovative idea 
Reagan got a redcarpet welcome and a 21gun salute as he 
stepped off Air Force One 
In his welcoming remarks de la Madrid said Today we affirm 
that our relations are conducted on a very positive level 
He said their summit the sixth and final meeting of the two 
outgoing presidents would strengthen the basis for good and 
productive relations and be a forum for discussing problems as 
frankly as we always have 
Reagan cited USMexican steps on trade economic problems and 
law enforcement and said We can be proud of what has been 
accomplished in so short a period 
He said their meeting paved the way for a new generation of 
political leaders in both our countries who will soon follow us and 
build on the foundation weve laid 
That foundation is cemented by our shared values and common 
goals a better quality of life for our peoples opportunties for 
our children and the dignity of living peacefully in free and 
democratic societies Reagan said 
He said much remains to be done but we can be proud of the 
legacy we leave 
While the two leaders met senior officials from both countries 
held talks of their own focusing on foreign policy trade drugs 
and law enforcement 
Reagan was accompanied by Shultz Treasury Secretary James A 
Baker III Attorney General Edwin Meese III and Trade 
Representative Clayton Yeutter 
One agreement was signed allowing more Mexican textile and 
apparel exports into the United States 
The agreement already in the process of being implemented 
gives Mexico the sixth largest supplier of textiles to the United 
States an automatic 6 percent increase in exports to that rich 
market in the next four years 
Although minor in scope the pact symbolizes the cooperation 
between the two countries as Mexico seeks to increase its exports 
and at the same time open its own market to more US products by 
reducing tariffs 
Another accord dealing with telecommunications had been 
expected to be signed but was pulled back because of a 
lastminute minor screw up said Abrams He said he expected it 
would be signed in a few days 
Reagan also devoted his weekly radio address to the summit 
While avoiding direct criticism of Mexicos support of the 
leftist government of Nicaragua Reagan said the establishment of 
Soviet and Cubanbacked totalitarian regimes is a threat to 
stability and freedom 
Nowhere is that threat more acute than in Central America 
Reagan said I would hope that the United States and Mexico will 
find common interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat 
The summit falls just two weeks before Reagan must ertify 
whether drug trafficking nations such as Mexico have made adequate 
progress attacking the problem 
For nations that fail to win certification the United States is 
required by law to vote against proposed loans in the World Bank 
International Monetary Fund and other international financial 
institutions
