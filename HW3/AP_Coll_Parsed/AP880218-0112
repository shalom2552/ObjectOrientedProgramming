Although the provision of needed legal services for those who 
cannot afford them is an important goal in our society the current 
system earmarks a large portion of the funding to National and 
State Support Centers that have been critized for political 
involvement I urge Congress to disallow use of federal funds for 
such think tanks and limit the use of funds to the direct 
assistance of the poor in need of legal aid 
The government often continues programs at the federal level 
that are no longer needed This is the case with rural housing 
programs the Economic Development Administration urban mass 
transit discretionary grants urban development action grants 
sewage treatment Small Business Administration direct loans 
housing development action grants the housing rehabilitation loan 
program and economic development programs of the Tennessee Valley 
Authority Efforts to reverse this situation have been undertaken 
by prior administrations as well as my own but the limited results 
to date indicate the difficulty of curbing excessive government 
involvement in these areas 
Regulatory Relief For seven years I have worked to reduce the 
excess burdens of government regulation for all Americans working 
men and women consumers businesses and state and local 
governments As a result various departments and agencies have 
reduced the scope and costs of federal regulation Federal approval 
of experimental drugs has been expedited making them available to 
treat serious or lifethreatening diseases when other treatments do 
not work Excessive burdens on state and local governments are 
being lifted Access to goods and services has been made easier 
and at less cost Federal reporting requirements on individuals and 
businesses have been eased as well as the paperwork burden on 
those who wish to compete for contracts with the federal 
government Under the leadership of the Presidential Task Force on 
Regulatory Relief headed by the vice president the administration 
will continue these and other efforts to lessen the burden of 
excessive government regulation 
As a case in point my budget proposes termination of the 
Interstate Commerce Commission contingent upon enactment of 
legislation that completes deregulation of the motor carrier 
industry There is no justification for continued economic as 
opposed to safety regulation of surface transportation and there 
is a substantial argument against it As a result of economic 
deregulation of trucking and railroads consumers save tens of 
billions of dollars each year and the industry is healthier more 
innovative and better able to adapt to changing economic 
circumstances This is no time to turn back the clock 
Privatization The government and the private sector should do 
what each does best The federal government should not be involved 
in providing goods and services where private enterprise can do the 
jobs cheaper andor better In some cases the fact that no private 
provider exists is a reflection of government policy to prohibit 
competition as with first class mail service In other cases an 
absence of private providers reflects a government policy of 
providing large subsidies as with uranium enrichment Invariably 
the taxpayer ends up paying more for less
