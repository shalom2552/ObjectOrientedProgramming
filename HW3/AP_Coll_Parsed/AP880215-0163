A lawyer for John Demjanjuk used an Israeli 
example Monday in contending all secret services are insidious 
and the Soviet KGB could have fabricated evidence that his client 
commited war crimes 
During closing arguments at Demjanjuks trial lawyer Yoram 
Sheftel cited a judicial commission report published in October 
that showed agents of Israels Shin Bet agency routinely perjured 
themselves in court for 16 years in order to convict Palestinians 
and conceal violent interrogation methods 
Sheftel said the KGB had more sophisticated ways of fabricating 
evidence against Demjanjuk 
Defense lawyers claim a key piece of prosecution evidence an 
alleged Nazi identity card for Demjanjuk was forged by the Soviet 
Union Six prosecution experts have authenticated the card which 
says Demjanjuk was trained as a death camp guard at Trawniki in 
Nazioccupied Poland 
Secret service agencies everywhere are insidious and resort to 
fabrication and treachery Sheftel told The Associated Press 
during a recess I wanted to show that intelligence services can 
and have in the past fooled courts in Israel 
Demjanjuk 67 is accused of being a Ukrainian guard called 
Ivan the Terrible who brutalized prisoners and operated gas 
chambers at the Treblinka death camp in Poland where 850000 Jews 
were killed in 194243 
The defendant born in the Ukraine emigrated to the United 
States after World War II and was a retired auto worker living in 
Ohio when the United States extradited him for trial He says the 
Kremlin framed him because he fought in an antiSoviet unit at the 
end of the war 
Sheftel said the identity card was suspect because it came from 
Soviet archives closed to the West 
Dov Levine the presiding judge said the card was assumed to be 
authentic because it was an archival document and the defense must 
prove forgery 
To that Sheften replied In the Soviet Union they use deceit 
even in archives This document does not come from wellorganized 
Western archives
