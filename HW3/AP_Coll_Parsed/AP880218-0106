of the way people live in Utah and perhaps see the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir as it studies the area for colleagues who could be 
stationed here if the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty is 
ratified

Sadovnikov director of the Soviet city of Votkinsks Industrial 
Organization arrived Wednesday and planned to leave Friday said

office of Soviet Union Affairs

Lake area Cavanaugh said

downtown Salt Lake City on Wednesday and planned to visit mountain 
canyons today 
A threemember American delegation is in Votkinsk about 600

visit

treaty as areas where monitoring for the inspection of INF sites 
could take place Cavanaugh said

country

arrived at Salt Lake International Airport We hope to look 
around and see how people live Wed like to see the cultural side

plant if the Senate ratifies the INF treaty signed Dec 7 by 
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
