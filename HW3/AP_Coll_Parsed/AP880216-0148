Mayor Andrew Young apologized Tuesday to local 
ministers for remarks last week about presidential candidates Pat 
Robertson and Jesse Jackson which were interpreted as being 
critical of preachers 
Young speaking last week to a group of student journalists 
said I dont think you can go directly from the pulpit to the 
presidency Though Young was specifically critical of Robertson 
a former television evangelist in his speech he also extended his 
remarks to include black preachers of which Jackson is one 
Young himself an ordained Congregationalist minister told 
black clergymen Tuesday his remarks were intended to be 
tongueincheek 
I consider myself a preacher Young said I in no way 
intended or suggested that there was anything involved in the 
ministry of the gospel that should be taken lightly I think I was 
guilty of making a tongueincheek statement that I think the 
audience understood and implied no disrespect 
Suggesting that Robertson and Jackson lack the experience to be 
president Young told the students If youre a preacher you 
talk for a living so even if you dont make sense you learn to 
make nonsense eloquently 
Not that black preachers are different from white preachers 
but black preachers start out not intending to make sense he 
said
