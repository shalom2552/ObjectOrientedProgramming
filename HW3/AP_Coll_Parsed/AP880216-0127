NATO needs to decide what new shortrange 
nuclear weapons to build in view of the treaty eliminating 
mediumrange atomic missiles from Europe Senate Democratic leaders 
said Tuesday 
I dont think there is a clear consensus in the alliance about 
just exactly where we go from here said Sen Sam Nunn DGa 
chairman of the Armed Services Committee 
I do think there is a consensus for the modernization of 
shortrange nuclear weapons but there is no agreement yet on 
specifically which weapons to build he said 
Nunn and Majority Leader Robert Byrd DWVa were among a 
group of key senators who visited US allies in Europe last week 
as part of the Senates consideration of the Intermediaterange 
Nuclear Forces treaty negotiated two months ago by President Regan 
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
The treaty would eliminate mediumrange missiles on both sides 
but would allow both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the 
Warsaw Pact to build nuclear weapons with a range of less than 300 
miles 
Byrd told reporters that European leaders told the senators 
that the INF treaty should be approved without amendments and 
that following that NATO should procede with modernizing those 
groundbased nuclear weapons that are eligible under the treaty 
The general consensus was that the allies should not go for 
the third zero option said Byrd referring to calls from some 
European politicians for the total elimination of nuclear weapons 
They should plan to improve the range of those shortrange 
theater weapons that would be allowed and not emphasize the 
modernization of shortrange artillerytype weapons said Byrd 
But Nunn at the reopening of hearings by his committee on the 
treaty said NATO needs to decide specifically what type of 
shortrange weapons to build 
The options include nucleartipped artillery shells which have 
a range of 15 or 20 miles and longerrange weapons such as the 
Lance missile 
In 1983 NATO ministers agreed to build a new generation of 
shortrange weapons but that decision has not been implemented 
The Reagan administration has urged NATO to improve its 
nonnuclear weapons to offset Soviet numerical advantages in 
conventional weapons The alliance has long relied on the 
possibility of using nuclear weapons to deter a Soviet attack 
Edward L Rowny one of Reagans top arms control advisers told 
Nunns committee Tuesday that Soviet officials have frankly 
admitted to me that the cutting edge of their political and 
military power lies in their conventional forces 
They may be attempting to mesmerize the West with nuclear 
reductions while protecting the utility of their conventional 
superiority Rowny said 
Another witness Ronald Lehman who helped negotiate the INF 
pact noted that a substantial number of US nuclear weapons 
will remain in Europe after the INF treaty 
But NATO has never had a politically easy time when it built 
new nuclear weapons Lehman said 
Undoubtedly the Soviet Union hopes that a new arms control 
agreement will have a soporific effect on Western security concerns 
which will weapon NATOs defenses he said 
Retired Army Gen Bernard Rogers former supreme alllied 
commander told the Foreign Relations Committee that NATO should 
build a number of new shortrange atomic weapons 
They include an airtoground missile new artillery shells and 
an updated version of the Lance Rogers said 
He also urged approval of what he said are lowcost steps 
NATO could take including a comprehensive arms control strategy 
Zbigniew Brzezinski national security adviser under President 
Carter told the Armed Services Committee it would be a mistake 
to go along with efforts to negotiate for the elimination of all 
nuclear weapons 
Meantime Sen Alan Cranston DCalif said the Democratic 
leadership will go ahead and offer an amendment proposed by Sen 
Joseph Biden DDel that would require the administration to 
adhere to the view of the treaty outlined by administration 
witnesses 
Biden recently underwent surgery and is not expected to return 
to work before the treaty comes up for a vote Cranston said 
The proposal stems from an ongoing dispute between the 
administration and congressional Democrats over how to interepret 
the 1972 AntiBallistic Missile treaty Democrats want a 
narrow or restrictive interpretation while the 
administration has said it has the right to move to a broad 
interpretation that would allow tests of Reagans Star Wars 
antimissile program 
Secretary of State George Shultz recently wrote Nunn and Byrd 
that administration witnesses are speaking authoritatively meaning 
that some future administration wont be able to change its view of 
the what the treaty means
