A decline in the amount of corn readily 
available to the market is one reason feed grain prices have edged 
higher this winter the Agriculture Department said Wednesday 
The departments Commodity Credit Corp is estimated to have 
around 175 billion bushels of corn in its inventory for 198788 
compared with 144 billion bushels last season 
In addition farmers have large quantities of corn still under 
price support loan which cannot be sold on the market or used 
until the loans are settled If the loans arent repaid the grain 
winds up in CCC inventories 
Grain also is held in storage under the farmerowned reserve 
program or FOR and cannot be released until prices rise to 
specified levels 
A key factor in this years stronger corn and sorghum prices 
is the commitment of a larger share of the 198788 supply to CCC 
inventory FOR and regular CCC crop loans and shrinking 
uncommitted stocks the departments Economic Research Service 
said in an outlook report 
Corn prices have been edging upward in expectation that cash 
redemptions from loans will be necessary to meet market demands 
the report said Corn prices received by farmers are expected to 
average 165 to 185 a bushel up from 150 in 198687 
Sorghum prices are projected at 150 to 170 per bushel 
compared with an average of 137 in the 198687 season
