The government should ease back on acreage 
controls for the 1989 wheat crop the National Association of Wheat 
Growers said Friday 
Frank Johannsen association president said greater acreage 
should be permitted so the United States can keep filling a growing 
export demand For the last two years wheat farmers have been 
required to idle 275 percent of their base acreage in order to 
qualify for federal supports 
The Agriculture Department is to announce the 1989 wheat program 
by June 1 Johannsen a wheat farmer from Bayard Neb said the 
association wants the acreage reduction be held to no more than 20 
percent 
Johannsen said US wheat stockpiles are expected to drop by 30 
percent this season the largest annual decline in more than 20 
years 
A 1989 acreage reduction of less than 20 percent could be 
justified if USDA maintains its current export subsidy programs he 
said 
Since we dont know what will happen after the November 
elections our market outlook is somewhat cloudy thus making it 
more difficult to forecast export sales opportunities Johannsen 
said in a statement
