World chess champion Garri 
Kasparov will join 31 leading chess masters to compete for the 
record 75000 World Blitz Championship in Saint John on Friday and 
Saturday 
The event features a series of duels in which each players 
thinking time will be limited to five minutes per game 
Its going to be outrageous It will vanquish once and for all 
the idea that chess is a boring game said Jay Whitehead a 
26yearold International Master from San Francisco 
The series of four game knockouts will culminate Saturday in a 
sixgame grand finale 
Most experts are predicting a clash between Kasparov and his 
archrival fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov 
It would be their first meeting since their world title duel 
ended in a 1212 tie in Seville Spain last December leaving 
Kasparov as champion 
Other observers suggest the frantic pace of the games will 
increase the likelihood of an American or West European 
grandmasters pulling off a giantkilling victory 
While the 10week Seville contest featured a total prize fund of 
185 million the victor in Saint John will walk away with 37500 
for four hours work the highest first prize ever in a single 
tournament 
Its a completely different kind of chess but I think its 
very exciting for the public You need to concentrate for every 
second because of the speed said Karpov 36 at a news 
conference Thursday 
Spectators will be able to watch the play unfold using a 
special British made computer called an Intelligent chess display 
Using sensors in the board and pieces the moves will be 
instantaneously transmitted onto video screens throughout the hall 
Such events are part of the future of chess they are like an 
electric shock the 24yearold titleholder told The Associated 
Press Of course this kind of contest wouldnt have been 
possible without the new technology Kasparov added 
ESPN the sports cable network based in Atlanta plans to 
broadcast three onehour programs on the event 
We are trying to use the same broadcast technology used in 
other sports like split screens and extra closeups with the 
exception of slow motion replays said Peter Allies an executive 
producer with Torontobased Tier One Communications which is 
producing the programs 
A 12man World Swift championship played under similar 
conditions last April in Brussels Belgium was won by Kasparov 
Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman came in second with Karpov third 
Players reached this final through qualifiers held earlier in 
New York Philadelphia Biel Switzerland and in Saint John a city 
of 125000 on Canadas eastern seaboard 
The blitz championship is the showcase finale of the World Chess 
Festival billed as the greatest chess spectacular ever held in 
North America 
The monthlong event has attracted more than 700 players from 26 
countries 
It will be Kasparovs first appearance in North America 
On Sunday the titlist will travel with his British manager 
Andrew Page to New York for a fourday tour including a display 
at a school in the citys poor south Bronx district and an 
exhibition match against celebrities 
The blitz is the kind of event to increase the popularity of 
the game I hope my visit will help to promote chess throughout the 
United States Kasparov said
