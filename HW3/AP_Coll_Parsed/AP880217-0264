Housing construction fell 19 percent in 
January to its lowest level since the end of the last recession 
the government reported today 
The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were being 
built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 138 million units 
last month 
The January setback which followed a 155 percent plunge in 
December surprised analysts who had been forecasting a modest 
rebound in construction activity 
The housing sector is being watched closely at present since it 
is often one of the first sectors to turn down at the start of a 
new recession 
While the majority of economists believe the country will be 
able to escape a downturn in this presidential election year some 
forecasters dispute this outlook in part because of concern about 
the record collapse of stock prices last October 
The January annual starts level was the slowest pace since a 
rate of 130 million units in December 1982 just as the last 
recession was ending The January pace was almost 24 percent below 
the rate at the beginning of 1987 
The weakness last month came from a 29 percent decline in 
construction of singlefamily homes which fell to an annual rate 
of 101 million units 
This drop offset a 08 percent increase in construction of 
multifamily housing wich edged up to an annual rate of 366000 
units still 35 percent below the level of a year ago This sector 
has been in a slump because of the impact of the 1986 tax law 
which removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real 
estate 
In other ominous news permits considered a good sign of future 
activity fell an even sharper 82 percent in January to an annual 
rate of 125 million units the lowest level for permits since 
January 1985 Permits had fallen 74 percent in December 
The January weakness in construction starts came from two 
sectors of the country Starts fell 218 percent in the Midwest to 
an annual rate of 223000 units and dropped 171 percent in the 
South to 469000 units 
These declines were partially offset by a 276 percent increase 
in starts in the Northeast where homes were being built at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 291000 units and a 212 
percent increase in the West where starts rose to a rate of 
394000 units
