The 130 Palestinian deportees whose voyage 
home was aborted by the bombing of their ship this week include 
prominent Arab proponents of peace with Israel as well as others 
who advocate violence 
Most were expelled from their Israelioccupied homeland without 
trial under a process considered illegal by virtually every nation 
except Israel 
The Palestine Liberation Organization gathered the deportees and 
hundreds of observers in Athens for a trip back to Israel aboard a 
ship of return 
Their goal was to focus attention on Israels policy of exiling 
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip which Israel seized 
in the 1967 Middle East war 
Participants said the voyage would have been probably the 
largest nonviolent action attempted by the PLO 
We have chosen to go back with no guns no explosives not 
even any stones said Mohammed Milhem deported mayor of the West 
Bank city of Halhoul 
Israeli leaders had vowed to block the ship from reaching 
Israels shores 
On Monday before the deportees could fly from Athens to the 
port of Limassol Cyprus to begin the protest voyage an explosion 
left a hole below the waterline of the ferry bought for the trip A 
day before three PLO guerrillas were killed in a car bombing also 
in Limassol 
The PLO accused Israel of responsibility 
The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the ship 
Exodus in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned 
back by British forces as they tried to reach Palestine 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had called the 
PLOsponsored trip a declaration of war on Israel and branded 
participants as terrorists and those who want to kill us every 
one of us 
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in 1985 that deportations 
were effective for those who instigate and call for participation 
in terror even though they themselves are not active 
The same 1945 British Mandate laws used by Israel for many of 
the deportations were applied against Shamir and other Israeli 
leaders who led guerrilla bands that assassinated and bombed 
British soldiers and Arabs in the 1940s 
The UN Security Council denounced the deportations in 1980 and 
again last month saying they contravened the 1949 Geneva 
Convention 
Their goal is to leave our people leaderless said 
AbdulJawad Saleh exiled in 1973 a year after his reelection as 
mayor of AlBireh 
Among those listed for the trip are the president of Bir Zeit 
University the president of the Jerusalem Higher Islamic Council 
the Jordanian mayor of Jerusalem the deputy mayor of Jenin and the 
assistant Anglican archbishop of Jerusalem 
Milhem expelled in 1980 and elected to the PLO Executive 
Committee in 1984 often has been suggested as a moderate 
Palestinian negotiator for Middle East peace talks 
Saleh described himself as a nonviolent activist and said 
he was never told specifically what triggered his deportation 
He recalled that Israeli military officials had summoned him to 
warn against founding agricultural cooperatives and ordered him to 
stop protesting on behalf of villagers outside AlBireh 
Like Milhem and many other exiles Saleh said he favors 
acceptance of Israel alongside a Palestinian state Two states to 
live in peace together in the same country was the way Anglican 
Bishop Eliya Khoury put it 
Not all deportees agree with that view 
Four Palestinians expelled last month issued a statement shortly 
after arriving in Lebanon saying Islamic radicals there should 
threaten to execute three Israeli hostages if Israel kept up 
its crackdown on Palestinians in the occupied lands More than 50 
Palestinians have been killed in rioting in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip since Dec 8 most of them by Israeli gunfire 
According to Palestinian and Jordanian officials Israel has 
deported up to 3000 Palestinians 
Many deportees say they want peace with Israelis but within an 
Arabdominated Palestinian state 
My brother and my grandfather and his father and my children 
were born in Palestine said Nashaat Labadeh a Nablus school 
principal This is our land Palestine belongs to us 
He said he was deported largely for his involvement in a 1968 
teachers strike against Israels attempt to impose its school 
books on West Bank pupils 
Saleh said Israel should not close its doors to those who have 
attacked it in the past 
Even if we were terrorists and we are demanding a peaceful 
solution I think we are the people to make peace with he said 
You dont make peace with your friends You make peace with 
your enemies
