Opponents in Parliament lost a final bid Tuesday 
night to water down a Conservative government bill restricting the 
promotion of homosexuality 
The amendment sought to limit to teaching in schools a blanket 
stipulation that local government authorities must not 
intentionally promote homosexuality 
The House of Lords the nonelected upper chamber of Parliament 
defeated the amendment 9048 meaning the bill is virtually certain 
to become law by June 1 
A Labor Party member Lord Longford charged that the bill 
which has already passed its key legislative stages in the elected 
House of Commons with large majorities smacked of a general 
queerbashing campaign 
Government Home Office Minister Lord Caithness retorted that 
gay pride programs and the promotion of gay rights in youth 
clubs run by some local authorities sought to glamorize 
homosexuality 
Young people are susceptible to these intolerable 
influences said Lord Caithness 
Activities such as a Lesbian Gay Strength and Pride Week are 
in the governments view at least as likely to glamorize 
homosexuality in the minds of impressionable young people as 
anything a teacher might do he said 
The House of Lords can delay and suggest changes to legislation 
but cannot overturn bills approved by the House of Commons 
Critics charge the bill will heighten hostility toward 
homosexuals and reflects prejudices of Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher She complained last fall that children were being taught 
they have an inalienable right to be gay 
Critics say the word promote is so vague it could mean local 
authorities censoring the works of famed homosexual writers such as 
Oscar Wilde 
Local authorities run public libraries some theaters and most 
state schools 
The government has denied prejudice but accused some leftwing 
local authorities of using state funds to promote homosexuality as 
an acceptable way of life 
Under the proposed law complainants could bring a civil suit 
against local authorities and auditors could also penalize them for 
misusing funds 
In wording gay rights groups said was particularly offensive 
the measure stipulated that local authorities must not promote 
the teaching in any maintained state school of the acceptability 
of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship 
Homosexuality between consenting adults has been legal in 
Britain since 1967 
Leftwing councils including those running inner city London 
boroughs and the northern cities of Manchester and Sheffield are 
derided by conservative newspapers for grants to gay and lesbian 
community groups
