Northwest Airlines announcement that it 
will lay off 5300 mechanics and baggage handlers if its flight 
attendants strike is a ploy to pit the two unions against each 
other a union official says 
Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler said Monday that the 
announcement made in a letter was only a precaution required by 
International Association of Machinists labor contracts with 
Republic Airlines Northwest acquired Republic in 1986 
But Jeff Musto a spokesman for the Teamsters said Northwests 
letter was a ploy to play the unions against each other and lower 
morale He said the letter would backfire and draw the unions 
closer together 
The letter was sent last weekend to 2900 mechanics and 2400 
baggage handlers represented by the IAM In it Northwest said 
Although your company does not expect a flight attendants strike 
it is impossible to predict whether the flight attendants will 
actually go on strike 
You may be placed on temporary nowork status due to a 
reduction in force if there is a strike 
Northwests 6500 flight attendants represented by the 
Teamsters can strike at 1101 pm Feb 26 Bargaining between the 
airline and the union is expected to resume next week 
The IAM which represents 20000 ground workers at Northwest 
and the pilots union have not said whether they will honor a strike 
by flight attendants
