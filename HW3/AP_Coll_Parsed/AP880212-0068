Angry tenants and a banner reading Welcome You 
Reptile greeted a landlord Friday when he reported to one of his 
buildings to serve a 15day sentence of house arrest for failing to 
correct housing violations 
Morris Gross 77 who lives in a luxury highrise in the 
Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn will be confined to a 
fifthfloor apartment in a building where tenants complain of bugs 
and rodents lack of heat and hot water and leaky ceilings 
His movements will be monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet 
to make sure he serves his sentence 
A judge convicted Gross of criminal and civil contempt in 
December after the city Department of Housing Preservation and 
Development brought action against him for failing to comply with a 
court order to correct housing violations 
He was fined 32000 for the contempt conviction and 137900 in 
civil penalties Judge Ira Harkavy gave him the option of spending 
15 days under house arrest and putting the 137900 toward the cost 
of correcting the 420 violations at the 113unit building in the 
Flatbush section of Brooklyn 
Asked why Gross chose house arrest his attorney Stanley 
Kopilow said Gross wanted to show to the judge and the community 
that this is not as bad as portrayed in the press 
Gross made no comment to the group of angry tenants who shouted 
at him when he walked into the lobby Friday morning The landlord 
whose meals will be catered will have a private security guard 
with him in the apartment during his sentence 
We ask for so many things and they dont do anything said 
tenant Errol Ramdeo 
He said the door to the apartment where he lives with his 
parents is off its hinges bathroom tiles are falling off the wall 
and their stove doesnt work 
Joyce Stewart president of the tenants association took a 
group of reporters on a tour to show them some of the violations 
She pointed out a large hole in the ceiling of one apartment from 
which water comes down like crazy 
Tenant Vivian Murray complained of flaking paint chips which 
she has discovered her 2yearold daughter eating 
Lawrence Carelli the housing agency attorney who handled the 
case said there were still 400 outstanding violations in the 
building some dating back five years 
Building superintendent Sydney Pilgrim said Gross had spent 1 
million to repair the building 
We know Gross is not an angel We know he should not have let 
the building run down so far but work is getting done Pilgrim 
said 
Ms Stewart charged that cosmetic repairs had been done on only 
10 to 12 apartments When you subtract that from 113 apartments 
youll see the real McCoy she said
