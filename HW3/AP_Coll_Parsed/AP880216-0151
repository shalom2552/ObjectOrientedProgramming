The Reagan administration said Tuesday it has 
begun an investigation into allegations that the government of 
South Korea has unfairly restricted US cigarette sales in its 
markets 
The Korean cigarette market is approximately 21 billion a 
year and is totally controlled by government monopoly US 
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a statement announcing 
the investigation 
The inquiry could lead to retaliatory tariffs against South 
Korean products if the government finds that the Korean 
restrictions constitute an unfair trading practice 
The government action came on a petition filed last month by the 
US Cigarette Export Association which contends that Korean 
barriers are causing US firms to lose 500 million annually in 
potential exports 
In his statement Yeutter said the industry petition raises 
questions about whether policies of the Korean government restrict 
US companies from open and nondiscriminatory access to the 
Korean cigarette market 
During the investigation the United States will make 
additional efforts to resolve this issue with the Korean 
government Yeutter said noting that the petition had been 
accepted following extensive consultations between the two 
governments over the past two years aimed at achieving open and 
nondiscriminatory market access 
Earlier this month the US government stripped dutyfree 
import treatment from products from South Korea and three other 
Asian exporters Hong Kong Taiwan and Singapore 
The United States last year ran a 71 billion trade deficit 
with South Korea 
In a related move the American Meat Institute on Tuesday filed 
a petition protesting a South Korean ban on the import of 
highquality beef claiming the ban is costing it 5 million a 
year The government has 45 days to act on the petition
