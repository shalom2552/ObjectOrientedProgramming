A prominent forensic psychiatrist testifying 
Thursday in a 225 million lawsuit brought against Soldier of 
Fortune by a murder victims family said a classified ad in the 
magazine led to the slaying 
In my opinion the advertisement was a proximate cause of 
death for Sandra Black said Dr Park Dietz 
Dietz who headed the forensic team that evaluated John Hinckley 
after he shot President Reagan in 1981 said Soldier of Fortune was 
the magazine of choice for people who looked through its 
classifieds for people willing to engage in illegal activity 
In earlier testimony Thursday Soldier of Fortune publisher 
Robert K Brown said he was unaware of news reports linking 
classified ads in the magazine to criminal acts before a killer was 
hired through the ads 
Brown in a second day of testimony in federal court said if he 
had known of the reports he might have eliminated the 
advertisements 
I would have conducted an investigation to see if it was an 
aberration or a pattern he said If we could have developed a 
pattern then I would have discontinued the ads 
A Texas family is accusing the Coloradobased magazine of 
negligence for running an ad that is linked to a womans 1985 
slaying The magazine bills itself as the journal of professional 
adventurers 
The ad placed by John Wayne Hearn brought him together with 
Robert Black and led to the murderforhire of Blacks wife 
Sandra of Bryan 
Black is on death row for paying Hearn 10000 to carry out the 
killing Hearn is serving three life terms for murder 
Marjorie Einmann Mrs Blacks mother and Gary Black the 
victims 18yearold son are seeking 25 million in actual 
damages and 20 million in punitive damages 
Attorneys for the magazine do not dispute the ad brought Hearn 
and Black together but insist Brown had no way of knowing the ad 
was for illegal activity 
Hearns ad which appeared in four issues in late 1984 sought 
Marine and Vietnam veterans and weapons specialists with jungle 
warfare expertise for highrisk assignments in the United 
States or overseas 
Hearn said in a deposition read into testimony Wednesday that 
his ad was intended to attract bodyguard and security work He said 
it brought responses from people looking for help with bombings 
assaults jail breaks and killings 
Brown said he had not read in Denverarea newspapers about an 
extortion indictment linking the magazines ads in May 1984 to a 
socalled collection agency allegedly involved in kidnap 
extortion and death threats 
Numerous stories about the extortion ring were run in 1984 but 
Brown said he may have been out of the area at the time or didnt 
see them 
Brown also denied Thursday that an advertising policy adopted in 
May 1984 was in response to police inquiries about crimes that may 
have been linked to classified ads in the magazine 
The policy established for the first time since the magazine 
began in 1975 a formal rejection procedure for classified ads 
It was a matter of setting policy to preclude events that 
might happen Brown said One of the motives was to upgrade the 
image of the magazine 
The policy listed about a dozen reasons why a classified ad 
could be rejected including any suggestion an ad would encourage 
illegal activity 
Brown acknowledged that continued publication of personal 
services ads had been discussed at the magazine for years and that 
he may have been the only person at Soldier of Fortune to favor 
their continuation 
He has said that the magazine was aimed at Vietnam veterans and 
that the classified ads were run as a source of employment for them
