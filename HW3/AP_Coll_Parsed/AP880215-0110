The Reagan administrations policy of keeping 
military and espionage blowups with the Soviet Union from slowing 
a drive for better overall relations is back in operation following 
the collision of US and Soviet warships in the Black Sea 
The United States complained about Soviet actions in last 
Fridays incident by summoning Soviet ambassador Yuri Dubinin to a 
20minute protest meeting with the State Departments thirdranking 
officer 
The department issued a public condemnation 
Yet Secretary of State George P Shultz has no plan to dwell on 
the incident when he goes to Moscow next week to discuss arms 
control regional issues like Afghanistan and the superpower summit 
envisioned for the spring according to an aide who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
How much damage will the Black Sea incident do to the broad 
range of USSoviet relations 
Not much the aide said 
Indeed the State Departments ontherecord reaction to what 
Navy officers called the deliberate and dangerous Soviet bumping of 
American warships operating innocently in the Black Sea included 
comments that conveyed more exasperation than outrage 
As Secretary of State Shultz said just a week ago we are 
prepared to deal with the best and worst of Soviet behavior said 
spokesman Rudolph Boone 
It is after all a competetive relationship Boone said 
The statement reflected the administration policy since the 
rise of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 of keeping 
distasteful and bitter bilateral disputes from poisoning efforts to 
elicit from Moscow a better human rights record arms control 
compromises and a withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan 
Over the past three years whether the issue has been alleged 
Soviet spying the jailing of US journalist Nicholas Daniloff or 
attacks on American military observers in East Germany the Reagan 
administration has complained taken retaliatory action in some 
cases and then gone back to the bargaining table 
The most serious bilateral blowup in recent years and the one 
that came closest to upsetting overall relations was the Daniloff 
case The US News amp World Report Moscow correspondent was 
arrested in August 1986 on espionage charges and held in prison for 
several days despite President Reagans unwavering denials that 
Daniloff was a spy 
Daniloff was arrested after US authorities jailed Gennady 
Zakharov a Soviet United Nations employee who the United States 
said really was a spy 
After long negotiations the affair was settled by both men 
being sent home in a deal that paved the way for Reagan to meet 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a summit in Iceland a month 
later 
Another major controversy erupted over charges that Soviet 
intelligence had compromised secrecy at the US embassy in Moscow 
first by planting bugging devices in a new chancery building and 
then by compromising Marine guards responsible for security at the 
existing embassy office 
Concern about the two breaches of security reached their height 
in early 1987 after three former Marine guards at the embassy were 
arrested on suspicion of letting Soviet agents prowl through secure 
areas of the embassy 
At the time Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A 
Shevardnadze were trying to achieve a breakthrough on a deal to 
limit intermediate range nuclear missiles 
Although Shultz considered calling off a planned conference with 
Shevardnadze in Moscow to work on the arms pact because of the 
security problem he went forward with the meeting 
By all accounts of his sessions with Gorbachev in Geneva in 
1985 in Iceland and in Washington last December Reagan has 
raised the bilateral issues and complained about the alleged spying 
and bugging 
He also has protested attacks by Soviet troops on US military 
observers operating in East Germany under post World War II peace 
agreements 
Yet the complaints remain in a separate compartment from the 
other issues 
As Rozanne Ridgway the assistant secretary of state for 
European affairs has put it There will always be setbacks in a 
relationship that is continuously evolving We will always have our 
problems with the Soviet Union that is inevitable When they do 
things we dont like we tell them often very forcefully 
The goal is to try to manage the relationship
