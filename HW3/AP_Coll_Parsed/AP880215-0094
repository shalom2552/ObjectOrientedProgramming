Prince Edward arrived 10 minutes early this 
morning for his new job as a theater production assistant a pack 
of teabags under his arm and a bodyguard in his limousine 
Queen Elizabeth IIs youngest son who abandoned a career in the 
Royal Marines last year was hired by composer Andrew Lloyd 
Webbers Really Useful Theater Company 
His job as a production assistant is the theaters lowest rung 
It involves everything from running errands to making tea but its 
the first time a close male relative of the British monarch has 
landed employment outside the military 
The 23yearold prince casually dressed in a blue sweater and 
collarless tweed jacket arrived with his personal bodyguard in a 
limousine at the Palace Theater in the heart of Londons West End 
Sian Watling a 29yearold beautician handed him a single rose 
which she said she bought on impulse from a nearby flower shop 
Before the princes arrival police with sniffer dogs checked 
the theater 
The Palace is currently playing Les Miserables the 
smashhit musical of Victor Hugos novel of the same title which 
won eight Tony awards 
The theater building also houses the offices of Lloyd Webbers 
company one of the most dynamic forces in the business 
responsible for a string of successes including Cats and 
Phantom of the Opera 
The prince wont be treated as a member of the royal family 
but as an employee Bridget Hayward the companys executive 
director said when he got the job He has said he wants to be 
treated as a worker that is his understanding of the job He has a 
lot to learn and we have plenty of work for him 
But being there will show the prince the complexities of what 
makes a successful show 
His pay if any hasnt been disclosed
