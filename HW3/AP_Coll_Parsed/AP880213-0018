Alfie flew the coop nearly a week ago 
and macaroni and cheese chicken clucks and feline whines have 
failed to coax him back 
The male Mexican yellowheaded parrot remained among the missing 
Friday following his escape during a family picnic in the park in 
this Southern California city 
He was sitting on top of the station wagon and he said Bye 
bye and flew up to one of the pine trees about 35 feet up 
owner Susan Gabler said 
Every morning since Alfies escape Sunday Mrs Gabler has been 
strolling through Waller Park meowing like a cat clucking like a 
chicken and crying like a baby in an effort to lure him home 
When she wasnt making the sounds Alfie has learned to mimic 
over the years she was holding out a pot of macaroni and cheese 
the birds favorite meal in hopes the aroma would waft into the 
treetops and entice him to return home to his 200pound wrought 
iron cage 
As they often did the Gablers let Alfie out of his cage during 
Sundays picnic to allow him a taste of freedom Alfie took off 
After going home and calling authorities about her escaped pet 
Mrs Gabler returned to the park where she could hear Alfie but 
couldnt see him 
So far Mrs Gabler hasnt spotted Alfies bright yellow head 
red shoulders or green body but she heard him Sunday and Wednesday 
She said she is worried especially since owls and hawks live in 
the park and are much larger than her twopound pet 
Mrs Gabler is convinced Alfie has survived in the unseasonably 
warm weather feeding on scraps people have dropped for the ducks 
in the park But hes never had to forage for food before she 
added 
She said she and her three children would continue the daily 
hunt for Alfie
