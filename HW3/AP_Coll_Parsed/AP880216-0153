The PLO said Tuesday it will attack 
Israeli targets to avenge the killing of three guerrillas and the 
bombing of a ship intended to carry Palestinians on a protest 
voyage to Israel 
Abu Nidals dissident PLO group known for terrorist attacks 
also vowed revenge 
Two of the bodies of Mohammed Sultan and Mohammed Buheis were 
flown to Amman Jordan for burial 
The Palestine Liberation Organization has blamed Israeli secret 
service Mossad for the killings Sunday and the explosion Monday 
on the ferry Sol Phryne both in Limassol The ferry was holed 
below the waterline 
Cyprus condemned both attacks but made no accusations and said 
an investigation was being conducted to determine whether the 
events were related 
A PLO statement issued in Nicosia said Israel knows that the 
PLO is not handcuffed The blood of our martyrs will not go 
unavenged 
Sultan Buheis and the third guerrilla Marwan Kayyali were 
killed in a car bombing in Limassol on the southern coast 
They apparently were attacked after arranging the sale of the 
Sol Phryne to a PLOaffiliated company for the ship of return 
voyage to Israel with 130 Palestinians who have been expelled from 
Israelioccupied Arab territories The trip originally was to have 
begun at Piraeus Greece 
In Athens PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said the three men 
were not linked to the voyage 
We deny completely any relationship between the three who were 
assassinated by the Israelis two days ago in Limassol and the 
journey of return he told reporters We deny any relationship 
between the three martyrs and chartering the boat We deny also 
that the ship was bought by the three men 
He said they were on a different mission 
We are continuing our plans and we will sail in spite of 
Israeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas noble 
ideas Abu Sharif said 
Cleanthis Vlahopoulos captain of the ferry said several 
months would be needed to make the Sol Phryne seaworthy again 
In Lebanon a statement by the Abu Nidal group pledged to avenge 
the guerrillas deaths with double swift retaliation 
Abu Nidal whose real name is Sabry alBanna has been blamed 
for terrorist attacks around the world since splitting from Yasser 
Arafats mainstream Fatah guerrillas in the early 1970s He is 
wanted in Europe and the United States 
A senior PLO official in Nicosia said the slain guerrillas were 
not members of Abu Nidals FatahRevolutionary Council but they 
were popular active and wellrespected officers with whom Abu 
Nidal had worked before he split from Fatah 
Also in Lebanon a group calling itself Islamic Jihad Squads in 
Palestine said it would kill Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of 
Israel Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon as a price for this 
crime The threat was contained in a statement delivered to a 
Western news agency in Beirut 
A man claiming to speak for the USbased Jewish Defense League 
said Monday it was responsible for the attack on the 6151ton Sol 
Phryne 
The JDL is responsible for the bombing at Limassol he told 
The Associated Press in Nicosia by telephone This is only a 
warning Next time we will bomb it with all the people on it 
The head of the Jewish Defense League Irv Rubin told The 
Associated Press in a telephone interview Monday from Los Angeles 
that the bombing was a righteous action but his organization 
was not involved 
Shamir has said the voyage would be considered a declaration 
of war and Israel would stop it in the ways it sees suitable 
Israels transport minister Chaim Corfu appeared to suggest on 
Tuesday that his government was behind the bombing 
If the PLO obtains another vessel its fate will be the 
same he said on Israel radio We knew we wouldnt allow the 
boat to reach Israel If we could prevent its departure that was 
obviously the right thing to do
