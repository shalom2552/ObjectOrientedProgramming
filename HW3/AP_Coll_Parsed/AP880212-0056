A psychiatrist may be barred from conducting 
federally sanctioned drug testing because of alleged inaccuracies 
he published regarding an experimental treatment for Alzheimers 
disease 
Dr William K Summers of Arcadia Calif received the warning 
last month in a letter from the Food and Drug Administration that 
involved his account of preliminary studies on 
tetrahydroaminocrydine or THA for combating the degenerative 
mental illness 
After the New England Journal of Medicine published Summers 
paper in November 1986 a public outcry arose for wider testing of 
the drug which Summers said was very promising 
The FDA subsequently approved such broader testing only to 
suspend it late last year because of an unanticipated number of 
side effects The test procedures were redrawn and clinical trials 
allowed to resume last month 
Summers submitted his findings on the Alzheimers drug to the 
FDA five days after their publication in the New England journal 
The FDA letter to Summers noted that the journal article was 
submitted as part of his official report to the FDA and said 
there are numerous statements in your NEJM article that appear to 
be false 
We believe that you have repeatedly or deliberately violated 
regulations pertaining to the proper conduct of clinical testing of 
investigational drugs said the letter from Dr Frances O 
Kelsey director of an FDA division that oversees compliance with 
agency research procedures It said he may be barred from 
performing sanctioned tests in the future 
The letter asked Summers to explain 14 specific instances where 
the FDA found evidence of misinformation It said those are not a 
comprehensive compilation of findings but represent the more 
significant regulatory violations that remain unexplained 
One of the 14 charges said Summers failed to report that eight 
patients in his study also were taking other drugs that could 
affect mental functioning along with THA 
Another said he failed to report that 10 of the 12 patients in 
one phase of his study lived more than 2000 miles from his office 
and that medical monitoring was erratic and conducted mainly 
through telephone contacts and letters with either family members 
who had a variety of perceptions or local physicians who you 
concede often did not follow your research protocol 
A third charge questioned what the FDA said is Summers 
subsequent acknowledgement that some of the study statistics he 
submitted were reconstructed from memory 
It does not seem plausible that you precisely remembered 
multiple observations of the entire patient population without a 
written record the agency said 
Summers relayed word through his answering service Friday that 
he was not accepting telephone inquires about the subject He has 
several informal and formal procedures available to him to defend 
his testing practices to the FDA 
The FDA letter was disclosed initially in a story in Fridays 
New York Times 
The FDA has not released the letter but The Associated Press 
obtained a copy from another government source That source who 
asked to remain anonymous said Summers has replied in writing to 
the FDA but declined to release a copy of the response
