Five rare old navigation charts on vellum the 
oldest dating from about 1460 will be sold in London in April 
Auctioneers Christies said the charts were found recently in 
Europe after being hidden since the time of Napoleons campaigns 
The sellers name was not disclosed 
Two documents are by a wellknown family of chart makers the 
Teixeiras of Portugal and date from 1587 and 1620 
The oldest chart was made in Genoa about 1460 and depicts the 
Mediterranean and midAtlantic 
Another was by a Dutchman and based on a Portuguese model about 
1600 
The fifth is of the North Sea and the Baltic in 1588 by 
Englishman Thomas Laton 
The finely inked and colored charts with flags coats of arms 
and even saints show ports in Europe and Africa and later in the 
Americas They are expected to bring from 12000 to 87000 each 
at the April 13 sale 
For a long time before the French Revolution the charts were 
owned by a Flemish family the counts of Maldeghem who were 
burgomasters of Bruges now in Belgium said Sarah Soames of 
Christies books and manuscripts department 
She said Laton worked in Danzig now Gdansk Poland and was 
probably connected with the Eastland Co which traded English 
woolen cloth for Polish grain 
Independent art historian Huon Mallalieu said after examining 
the charts They are very rare things and would have been secret 
in their time because they were the valuable working tools of 
sailors They show the prevailing winds and routes around the 
world
