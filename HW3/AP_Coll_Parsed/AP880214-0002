Virgil Hawkins a black man who waged a 
28year battle to practice law in Florida and helped break the 
color barrier at the University of Florida Law School died 
Thursday at age 81 
In 1949 at age 41 he applied to the allwhite law school in 
Gainesville and was rejected He challenged the segregated school 
system and in 1956 the US Supreme Court ruled that he should be 
admitted 
But the Florida Supreme Court invoked states rights to deny him 
admission and the state adopted rigid entrance requirements that 
made it impossible for Hawkins to enroll 
In 1976 the Florida Bar urged the state Supreme Court to allow 
Hawkins to take the bar exam even though he had attended an 
unaccredited law school in Massachusetts 20 years earlier The bar 
said he deserved special consideration because of ill treatment in 
1949 
The Florida Supreme Court waived a requirement that he take the 
exam 
Hawkins opened a practice in Leesburg but in 1984 the Florida 
Supreme Court censured Hawkins and placed him on probation for two 
years for errors he made in his first cases Hawkins facing two 
more complaints resigned from the bar in 1985
