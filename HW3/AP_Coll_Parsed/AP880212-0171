New York investor Donald Trump may 
seek up to 249 percent of MCA Inc the parent of Universal 
Studios the entertainment conglomerate said Friday 
It has been speculated for more than a year that MCA would be a 
takeover target but until now no suitor has emerged 
Some analysts have long contended the companys stock was 
undervalued But it was believed a hostile takeover would be 
difficult because MCA is ruled with an iron hand by Lew Wasserman 
the last of the oldline movie moguls 
Wasserman 74 has been with MCA and its forerunner Music Corp 
of America since 1936 
In a brief announcement MCA said it had been notified by Trump 
that he owns 375000 of the companys shares and may seek to 
acquire 249 percent 
MCA has 771 million shares outstanding 
MCAs announcement came after the stock market closed but the 
companys stock already had jumped by 525 per share to 45 on 
rumors that a takeover bid was in the offing 
Like most other companies MCAs shares took a beating in the 
stock market crash and never fully recovered In the past year 
their highest price was 6450 
Trump spokeswoman Norma Foerderer in New York said she had no 
comment 
MCA takeover speculation peaked in mid1987 when Wasserman was 
hospitalized for a prolonged period after what was to have been 
routine surgery to remove a polyp from his colon 
However Wasserman did return to the helm of the entertainment 
giant after five weeks reportedly with his corporate power 
undiminished 
To dissaude suitors MCA last July adopted a poisonpill 
permitting stockholders to buy new shares at half price if a 
hostile bidder acquired more than 20 percent of MCA or made an 
unsolicited tender offer for more than 30 percent 
Wassermans control comes more from the respect he commands than 
from the stock he controls 
Wasserman owns 69 percent of MCAs stock and controls another 
89 percent through a series of trusts including those of the 
family of MCA founder Jules Stein 
From its beginning as a Hollywood talentbooking agency MCA has 
grown into a powerhouse in producing movies television 
programming records and toys 
It operates a successful backlot tour of Universal Studios here 
is building one in Florida and has agreed to build one in Japan In 
all three locations it would be competing with theme parks by its 
archrival Walt Disney Co 
MCA also is involved in book publishing retail and mailorder 
businesses 
In 1987 MCA earned 1379 million or 197 per share a 
decrease of 9 percent from a year earlier when it netted 1509 
million or 197 per share 
The decline would have been even more dramatic except that the 
1986 results already were depressed by a 50 million writeoff to 
cover bills it was unlikely to collect from independent television 
stations that had used MCA programs 
Trump who made his fortune in New York real estate is building 
a casino empire with two hotelgaming houses already in Atlantic 
City NJ and a permit pending for a third one 
Trump also is seeking to gain total control of Atlantic 
Citybased Resorts International Inc He already owns 90 percent of 
the companys voting power 
In addition Trump in the past has acquired stakes in takeover 
targets and later sold them for a handsome profit
