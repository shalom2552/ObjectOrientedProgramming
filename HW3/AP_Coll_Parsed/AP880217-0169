Sen Albert Gore Jr dismissed his poor showing 
in New Hampshire and sought support Wednesday in Southern states 
saying too much emphasis had been put on early presidential 
contests 
He also criticized fellow Democratic candidates accusing them 
of being out of touch and saying I see all of the other 
candidates as peas in the same pod 
This is the kickoff of the main event in this election year 
Gore said at a conference for supporters telecast from Houston 
This is the time we kick our campaign into high gear 
He made his comment about peas in the same pod earlier in 
an interview on CBS This Morning In that same interview he 
said his rivals picked up some harmful political baggage in the 
form of positions they adopted in Iowa and New Hampshire 
In Houston Gore said he had no regrets about skipping the New 
Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses and turning his money and 
attention to the South where more than a dozen states have 
contests on March 8 known as Super Tuesday 
The Tennessee senator who finished fifth in the New Hampshire 
primary Tuesday with about 7 percent of the vote had campaigned 
little there and in Iowa where he also did poorly 
The importance of Super Tuesday is not simply in the fact that 
almost half the delegates will be selected on March 8 Gore said 
The importance of Super Tuesday is also in the fact that there 
are people all over the United States who have been waiting to see 
more power given to Democrats at the grassroots level in the 
selection of a Democratic nominee 
The conference was telecast to an estimated 52 locations in more 
than 30 cities About 40 supporters attended at the site of the 
telecast in Houston 
Gore said three Democratic rivals he later identified them as 
Jesse Jackson Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis have taken 
positions on foreign policy and defense policy that are completely 
out of touch with the mainstream voters in this country 
Gephardt who finished second in New Hampshire and won the Iowa 
caucuses has flipflopped on issues in his campaign Gore said 
It is now very widely known that Dick Gephardts positions 
adopted for the Iowa caucuses are just completely at odds with what 
hes done in the last 12 years in the House and Senate he said 
Theres a very long list its not just one or two positions 
Gore had other scheduled stops in Beaumont Texas Shreveport 
La and Dallas on Wednesday as he continued his campaign in the 
South and other Super Tuesday states 
Were going to win it because weve conserved our resources to 
aim right at the Super Tuesday states he said
