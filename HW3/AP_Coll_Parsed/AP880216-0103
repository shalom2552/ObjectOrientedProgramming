Medicare budgettrimming has squeezed hospital 
profits to the point where health care for the elderly could be 
threatened according to testimony Tuesday before the House Aging 
Committee 
The hospital operating profit margins are just one indicator 
that the federal government may have cut into the heart of an 
alreadyshredded safety net protecting the elderly said Rep 
Edward R Roybal DCalif the committee chairman 
Hospital average profit margins under Medicares payment system 
were above 14 percent in 1984 and 1985 then dropped to 96 percent 
in 1986 according to federal statistics Projections show that 
hospitals on the average will lose money on Medicare patients by 
next year 
We are approaching a critical juncture where further 
reductions and a lack of predictability could begin to have an 
effect on the provision of care to this nations elderly and 
poor said a statement submitted by the American Hospital 
Association 
Congress at White House urging has enacted in the past few 
years a cost control system for Medicare and President Reagan is 
expected to propose further belttightening in the fiscal 1989 
budget he submits on Thursday 
The Medicare program doubled in cost between 1980 to 1987 to 
80 billion and is expected to exceed 100 billion next year 
Dr Donald Young executive director of the Prospective Payment 
Assessment Commission which reports on the Medicare payment 
system said the downward trend in hospital profits appeared to be 
continuing and the access of Medicare beneficiaries to quality 
care could be threatened 
However he said the most important reason for the profits 
decline was not a reduction in Medicare payments but the continuing 
increases in hospital costs There have been few signs recently 
that hospitals are changing their behavior to increase efficiency 
or productivity he said 
Eric Shulman legislative director for the National Council of 
Senior Citizens said the figures may have grave consequences for 
all older Americans in part because of industry priorities 
I find it unconscionable that the hospital industry would 
first react to news of declining profits by threatening to subject 
patients to lowerquality care and to deny them all the care they 
may require he said
