suit filed by the widow of former Indiana University football 
player Denver Smith against the city of Bloomington and three 
police officers 
We were disappointed Very very disappointed Cynequa 
Smith who had sought 18 million in damages said after the 
verdict Monday 
Mrs Smiths lawsuit claimed police officers had violated her 
civil and constitutional rights as well as those of her late 
husband and the couples 4yearold daughter when they fatally 
shot Smith during a struggle over a gun on Sept 12 1983 
Mrs Smiths attorney Rich D Hailey said he would decide 
within a week whether an appeal would be filed 
Mrs Smith claimed her husband was mentally impaired when he was 
shot Her lawsuit alleged negligence on the part of Bloomington 
police officers Steven Sharp Randall Keller and James Ratcliff 
Defense attorney Doug King said in closing arguments Sunday that 
the three officers did only what they had to not what they 
wanted to do 
In his instructions to the jury US District Court Judge John 
D Tinder said they were to balance the plaintiffs claim that 
Smiths rights were violated by the excessive use of force with the 
defendants contention that using deadly force was reasonable 
because the officers had cause to believe Smith posed a threat to 
their safety and lives 
Smith was from Dayton Ohio
