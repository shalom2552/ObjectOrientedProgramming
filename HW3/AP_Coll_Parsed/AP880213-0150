An airport bartender who was fired for giving a 
495 sandwich away to Mayor Eugene Sawyer was offered his job back 
Saturday but he said he didnt want it 
Im hoping to hear from the mayors office in reference to a 
job instead Michael Bueschel said But I dont want to be 
pushy I will sit back until they call me 
Bueschel was fired Friday from his 5anhour job at a Midway 
Airport restaurant for giving away food without permission manager 
Guy Accettura said 
The dismissal was rescinded Saturday 
We felt there was a major misunderstanding on Mikes part and 
our part With everything involved it was the mayor we 
fullheartedly invited Michael back to his position Accettura 
said 
The mayor waiting for a flight to Alabama on Thursday gave one 
of his security men 10 to buy a sandwich The guard returned with 
the money a sandwich and a note from Bueschel which read Mr 
Mayor Keep up the good work Compliments of Cafe Volare 
Bueschel 23 a college student said police officers routinely 
received free coffee doughnuts and sandwiches at the airport 
I figured if Chicago police officers could get a free 
sandwiches why couldnt the mayor Hes the boss he said 
The mayor is a fair good man I like the way he came into 
office and took charge said Bueschel 
Its a big city to take care of and it seems he is keeping 
things under control he said 
Sawyer heard about Bueschels firing Friday and vowed he would 
soon have a new job 
Ill help him find one Sawyer said at the time If we 
cant find one for him Ill give him one myself 
Sawyers spokesman Monroe Anderson could not be reached for 
comment on Bueschels comments Saturday about a job His home phone 
was unanswered 
I would like to get on the fire department thats a real 
long shot but my dad is a fireman and Id like to keep up the 
family tradition Bueschel said
