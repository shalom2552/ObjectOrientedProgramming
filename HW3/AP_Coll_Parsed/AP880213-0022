Gertrude Ferris always knew she had 
a gem of a mate but she never dreamed he would be named Husband 
of the Year on Oprah Winfreys television show 
We are just floating said Sidney Ferris 77 It was just 
a tremendous experience We werent nervous a little bit stunned 
maybe The significance of it all hasnt settled in on us yet 
The Ferrises who will celebrate their 53rd wedding anniversary 
in April won the first prize a trip for two to Hawaii 
Two weeks ago Winfrey asked wives across America to write and 
tell her why they thought their spouse deserved the title of best 
husband 
More than 10000 letters poured in From those nominees 25 
finalists were selected including Ferris 
All 25 men and their wives appeared on Fridays show in Chicago 
wearing beauty pageant sashes with their names on them For the 
shows opening they marched across the stage and sang Hello 
Oprah to the tune of Hello Dolly 
Each wife read a portion of her letter aloud and each husband 
had about 30 seconds to answer the question What do you love 
about your wife and married life 
Mrs Ferris however is legally blind and needed help from her 
husband 
He read her letter and it was just heartwarming He just stole 
everyones heart said Colleen Raleigh one of the shows 
publicists 
The part of the letter Ferris read 
My angel is 77 years of age and he does all the heavy 
housework the laundry and shopping because of my disability Since 
I am partially blind he inspects my clothes and checks my makeup 
every day My neighbors say when they see Sidney they also see a 
halo over his head 
For his part Ferris called his wife my angel And then a 
beaming Mrs Ferris hugged and kissed him 
I wish every young woman could meet a young man who cares 
about life and love as he does she said
