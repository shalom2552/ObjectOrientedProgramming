Among the alsorans Gary Hart and Bruce 
Babbitt failed in New Hampshire to extract themselves from the 
bottom of the sevenman Democratic heap but Pete du Ponts 
slowbutimproved showing on the Republican side Tuesday gave him 
cause for hope 
None of the lasttier candidates was counting himself out as 
votes from the nations first primary rolled in But in the days to 
come New Hampshire still could send a few candidates packing 
before Super Tuesday rolls around March 8 
Proving that in politics all things are relative du Pont who 
was running fourth in the fiveman Republican field said This 
has been a terrific evening for us here in New Hampshire 
He had finished fifth in a sixman field before the withdrawal 
of Alexander Haig in Iowas caucuses a week earlier 
Du Ponts showing was just shy of Jack Kemp and ahead of 
Robertson according to partial returns All three trailed 
frontrunner George Bush and his main rival Bob Dole 
For the Democrats Babbitt edged out Hart Ahead of them were 
Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore each of whom had solid organizations 
awaiting them in the South Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon were in 
the strong second tier behind winner Michael Dukakis 
Hart who won New Hampshire when he ran in 1984 but whose 
candidacy has failed to catch fire since he reentered the 1988 
race called his meager showing at the bottom of the Democratic 
pack this time disappointing but not discouraging 
The former Colorado senator said he expects to be a candidate 
as far ahead in the future as I can see but he was pragmatic 
about the need to start picking up some solid support that would 
translate into the dollars and delegates needed to win nomination 
I understand that there are standards that have to be met in 
terms of delegates and votes he said It will take at least 30 
to 60 days to determine if I can put together a viable candidacy 
Babbitt who had said prior to the New Hampshire primary that 
its voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy 
insisted he wasnt ready to start planning his funeral just yet 
Im going to move on for a couple of days to Washington in a 
couple of days and call and talk to my supporters all over the 
country and ask them this question How can we keep this reform 
movement alive 
Jackson said he met with Babbitt on Tuesday night and discussed 
getting his support 
Our message has tremendous overlap I hope that in time we 
will work out some common ground in terms of our politics 
Jackson said 
Robertson failed to repeat his dramatic secondplace showing 
from Iowa but had never claimed hed sweep New Hampshire He had 
better prospects in sight in the South and plenty of money on hand 
to propel him forward 
One of the alsorans from the Iowa caucuses never even made it 
as far as the New Hampshire primary Haig last week bowed out and 
threw his support to Dole
