Former Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban met 
today with Secretary of State George P Shultz to discuss a new 
US initiative for Mideast peace talks but cautioned against 
expecting too much from the American mediation effort 
Eban told reporters after his 30minute meeting with Shultz that 
one must not see too distant horizons for the plan Shultz is 
taking to Israeli Jordanian and Egyptian leaders later this month 
Eban an ally of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he hoped 
Shultz can overcome reservations expressed by Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir about the US plan 
Shamir is concerned that the proposals which reportedly call 
for talks to begin in April between Israel and its Arab neighbors 
on Palestinian autonomy will force Israel to cede land to the 
Arabs 
The US plan which has not been made public envisions that 
negotiations on a final settlement for the territories that Israel 
captured in the 1967 Middle East war would begin in December 
The Reagan administration is trying to set the basis for 
continued efforts by the next administration to advance the 
ArabIsraeli talks Eban said 
As part of his efforts to obtain continuity and congressional 
approval for his ideas Shultz will be meeting later in the day 
with members of the Senate He held a similar meeting Tuesday night 
with some 25 members of the House to outline his views 
Shultzs activity came in response to two months of 
IsraeliPalestinian violence in which at least 53 Palestinians have 
been killed 
Eban a former Israeli ambassador to Washington and head of the 
Israeli parliaments foreign affairs and defense committee follows 
on the heels of Ehud Olmert another parliament member who met 
with Shultz on Sunday Olmert is a close trusted friend of Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir who faces opposition from Shimon 
Peres in the fractious coalition government 
Olmert told Shultz that Shamir was concerned over the US 
proposal to set December as the date for talks on the future of the 
occupied territories Shamir leader of the rightwing Likud bloc 
is concerned that such talks would lead to demands for land 
concessions to the Arabs 
Likud is opposed to giving back any of the captured territories 
which it views as a biblical heritage and a strategic buffer zone 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors Peres Labor Party is 
willing to relinquish some land for peace and supports an 
international conference to sponsor peace talks 
Egypt and Jordan said Monday the United States should not 
advance interim solutions to the Palestinian problem 
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said we have taken the 
position that any plan must clearly include first an overall 
settlement of the problem and second an international conference 
as a framework without any attempt to outflank it 
Prime Minister Zaid Rifai of Jordan who met in Cairo on Monday 
with Mubarak said that Jordan opposed partial solutions or 
projects for selfrule in the West Bank and Gaza Jordan wants a 
final settlement through an international conference he added 
Rifai reiterated Jordans demand for a United Nationssponsored 
international conference with the participation of the Security 
Councils five permanent members and all concerned parties 
including the Palestine Liberation Organization 
Shultz will visit Israel Jordan and Egypt starting about Feb 
25 some 24 hours after returning to Washington from meetings in 
Moscow 
While in Moscow Shultz is expected to sound out the Soviets on 
their position regarding Mideast peace talks 
Privately Israeli officials have suggested Shultz might suggest 
to his counterpart Edouard Shevardnadze that the United States 
would do all it can to ease a Soviet pullout from Afghanistan in 
return for which the Kremlin would ensure the support of its Arab 
allies in the Mideast for Shultzs plan
