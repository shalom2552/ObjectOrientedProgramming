TRW Inc has told 1000 aerospace 
workers here they will lose their jobs because federal budget cuts 
forced the Pentagon to cancel several key programs 
Thats only about a third as many as TRW had indicated earlier 
this month might have to be furloughed Nonetheless the action 
marks a sharp reversal for TRW which has avoided major layoffs for 
at least 15 years 
Within the next few days we will have provided notice of 
layoff to 1000 people said Julie Wright spokeswoman for TRW 
Space amp Defense in Redondo Beach We believe that a few hundred 
layoff notices may remain 
TRW which builds satellites defense electronics and manages 
several government weapons programs has about 18000 employees in 
Redondo Beach 
Ms Wright declined to say what programs were cut but observers 
speculated that one of the programs was a secret surveillance 
satellite 
TRW also has lost a major subcontract on a NASA satellite 
program and an Air Force communications system contract 
The first layoff notices went out late last week telling 
workers they had two to 12 weeks left with the company depending 
on length of service
