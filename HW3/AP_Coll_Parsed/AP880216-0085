The traditional New Hampshire marathon became a sprint this year 
in the eight days following last Monday nights Iowa caucuses Iowa 
jumbled the field somewhat setting up Doles confrontation with 
Bush here and giving impetus to Robertsons hope to outlast Kemp 
and du Pont among conservatives 
Within days of his Iowa victory Dole gobbled up Bushs once 
oncecommanding lead in the New Hampshire polls and said a 
followup win here might all but assure him the nomination 
The vice president retooled his style and his campaign message 
in a bid to regain his footing Scrapping the trappings of his 
office he largely abandoned formal speeches in favor of 
campaigning in a ski parka and driving a forklift around a 
lumberyard 
He pleaded guilty to the faults of poor oratory and lack of 
passion on the stump but said that shouldnt be mistaken for lack 
of concern Here I stand warts and all he said recalling 
Abraham Lincolns words If he wasnt embracing President Lincoln 
it was President Reagan and Bush ended his New Hampshire effort in 
the same New Boston NH town hall where Reagan ended his in 1980 
If Reagan were not coattail enough Bush campaigned Monday with 
New England baseball hero Ted Williams and conservative hero Barry 
Goldwater 
Dole riding the crest of his Iowa wave tried not to offend 
I want to be nice to everybody this week he said Even so he 
couldnt resist a few jabs at Bush as he vied with the vice 
president for the support of Reagans admirers 
He did what I did in 1980 Bush said early Tuesday of Dole 
He won in Iowa and came in and talked about momentum I did what 
President Reagan did He Reagan came in and started talking the 
issues as Ive been doing and I think its working 
Kemp branded Bush and Dole as certain tax raisers and du Pont 
thrust a notax pledge in front of Dole during a debate and 
demanded that he sign it He didnt 
Kemp unable to afford a fourthplace finish behind Robertson 
attacked the former minister for deliberate distortions on his 
television advertising and in printed flyers 
Robertson whose secondplace finish was the surprise of Iowa 
said New Hampshire might be startling too But he found himself 
embroiled in an eleventhhour controversy when the White House 
denied his startling claim that there are Soviet nuclear missiles 
in Cuba And he was peppered with questions about statements he 
made over the years from his TV ministry 
Dukakis benefited from his decades service as governor of 
neighboring Massachusetts and his longstanding opposition to the 
unfinished Seabrook nuclear power plant His aides watched 
anxiously to see whether Gephardt would develop a tidal wave of 
momentum following his Iowa win but it never materialized in the 
polls 
Gephardt delivered the same antiestablishment message that 
carried him to his Iowa victory but he found himself trying to 
fend off attacks that he had flipflopped on numerous issues over 
the years and fell into a nasty battle with Simon 
When you say in a TV ad who do you trust youre really 
bring into play motives motivation and whether or not somebody is 
reliable and I think that goes over the line said Gephardt 
whose campaign demanded that Simon withdraw his commercials 
Simon refused and said Gephardt was campaigning as a supporter 
of Reaganomics in New Hampshire after posing as an opponent in Iowa 
Gore a no show in Iowa spent time and money in New Hampshire 
and hoped to develop a nonSouthern base But he diverted some of 
his television money off into Southern and border states a fresh 
indication that his eggs are in one basket the Southern states 
that begin to vote next month 
Babbitt pleaded with the voters to accept his national sales tax 
proposal to reduce the deficit and he asked voters to prove the 
pundits wrong in counting him out of the Democratic race 
Hart campaigned extensively in the state that catapulted him to 
prominence in 1984 and said his comeback would continue no matter 
what 
Jackson like Gore looking for substantial support in the south 
chastised the others in a debate and urged his rivals to address 
the issues He did better than expected in Iowa and hoped to finish 
in doubledigits in New Hampshire
