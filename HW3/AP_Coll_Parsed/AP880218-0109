Nathalie Menigon a suspected member of the Direct 
Action terrorist group has been sentenced to 12 years in prison 
for the attempted murder of two policemen in 1980 
After deliberating for 35 minutes late Wednesday night a 
special criminal court panel of seven judges sentenced Ms Menigon 
for firing at the two policemen on Sept 13 1980 when they closed 
in on her and her companion JeanMarc Rouillan The policemen were 
not killed 
Prosecutor Daniel Barreyre had asked for a 15year sentence 
Ms Menigon 31 was the first of seven suspected Direct Action 
members scheduled to be tried in the next two weeks for crimes 
ranging from robbery to attempted murder 
She Rouillan and defendants Georges Cipriani and Joelle Aubron 
have been on a hunger strike for 75 days to protest their isolation 
in prison and to demand the right to receive more visitors All 
have been in the hospital section of Fresnes prison 
The four are believed by authorities to be among the original 
members of Direct Action which claimed responsiblity for the 
November 1986 assasination of French General Rene Audran in Paris 
and the January 1985 slaying of Georges Besse president of the 
Renault company in Yvelines outside Paris 
Those killings are still under investigation and the current 
trial deals with other crimes committed between 1980 and 1983 
Ms Menigon pale and thin entered the courtroom for the 
opening of her trial Wednesday in a wheelchair and accompanied by 
two nurses She refused to answer questions saying she was too 
weak 
She denounced the trial as the negation and theft of who I am 
of my identity as a militant communist revolutionary 
The seven defendants were convicted last week of the common 
charge of criminal association and received varying sentences up to 
10 years in prison 
All the suspected top members of Direct Action were arrested 
Feb 21 1987 at a Loire Valley farm Authorities said the arrests 
effectively put an end to the terrorist group
