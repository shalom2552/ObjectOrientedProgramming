Government warehouses that once bulged with 
surplus cheese and other commodities are running out forcing the 
Agriculture Department to cut off much of its aid to food banks and 
soup kitchens 
Rice and honey inventories will be gone next month and cheese 
and nonfat dry milk will be depleted in May said Assistant 
Secretary John W Bode who oversees the departments food and 
consumer services 
Flour cornmeal and butter distributions will continue as in 
recent months he said Friday Cheese nonfat dry milk rice 
and honey distributions will be suspended when we have given it all 
away When we get more we will distribute it 
It comes as no surprise For months operators of local food 
banks and soup kitchens have reported reduced USDA donations And 
last November the department predicted that its donations under the 
Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program would likely be a 
trickle by spring 
According to department estimates up to 18 million people had 
been getting some free food each month through the program 
The food was accumulated by the departments Commodity Credit 
Corp under various farm price support programs In the case of 
dairy for example the CCC buys surplus butter cheese and nonfat 
dry milk to prop up the price of milk paid to farmers 
But many federal supports have been reduced helping make some 
commodities more competitive on the market instead of winding up in 
government warehouses Overseas sales and donations also have 
helped drain off some of the surpluses Diversion of many CCCowned 
foods into school lunch programs also has reduced the stockpiles 
Although variations in surplus stocks cause the size of the 
temporary emergency program to go up and down our regular food 
assistance programs continue Bode said Lowincome 
Americans remain eligible for food stamps free lunches and 
breakfasts elderly food assistance supplemental food programs for 
women infants and children WIC child care meals and summer 
child feeding 
More than one of every seven Americans receives food assistance 
at some point in the year at a taxpayer cost of more than 56 
million a day he said 
Since 1981 approximately five billion pounds of surplus food 
worth more than 5 billion have been distributed through TEFAP
