The London Zoo has appointed an entertainment 
director for its caged creatures reasoning that bored animals are 
boring to watch 
Among the projects hell consider to amuse and stimulate the 
animals are 
showers for pigs and apes and food dispensers for fish and 
other animals which they can operate themselves 
musical keyboards on which orangutans can practice 
a playback tape for gibbons to recreate the duets they enact 
in the wild and an artificial termite mound for chimpanzees 
David Shepherdson is the first Behavioral Enrichment Research 
Fellow appointed by the 162yearold Zoological Society that runs 
the zoo and the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare 
The federation said today that Shepherdson is charged with 
developing and assessing devices to enrich the animals 
environment and to reduce abnormal behavior associated with 
captivity 
Shepherdson 29 attended Sussex University where he studied the 
behavior of badgers in the wild 
There has been very little research into the problems suffered 
by animals in captivity he said 
The federation said To give animals freedom to exercise their 
instincts and their intuitive powers not only increases their 
contentment but also adds to the enjoyment and appreciation of 
visitors
