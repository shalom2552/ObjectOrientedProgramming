A few wellearned wrinkles adorn the 
covergirls face on Lears a stylish new magazine that celebrates 
the woman who wasnt born yesterday 
I feel a kind of earthquake of women over 40 who are going to 
change life for themselves for the better said publisher Frances 
Lear 64 whose magazine hits the newsstands Tuesday Its going 
to be a greater movement than the womens movement 
For members of this new movement Lear the former wife of 
television producer Norman Lear blends a dash of fashion with 
nononsense financial advice and some savvy writing 
Once upon a time says her first editorial a woman took 
the events of her life added the pluses and deducted the minuses 
and lived with that arithmetic No more 
Lear a longtime supporter of womens causes knows all about 
change and about bouncing back 
Divorced after a 28year marriage to Norman Lear she left 
California for her hometown New York carrying two suitcases of 
clothes and the germ of an idea 
I could never look like Linda Evans Lear confides in a 
letter to potential subscribers The womens magazines were 
urging me to travel but every resort showed pictures of slim young 
women in bikinis 
What was needed she decided was a magazine for women like her 
educated affluent and over 40 It took a woman to see it she 
said 
Armed with the dream connections and money but lacking 
knowhow she spent 2 years picking the brains of the publishing 
world 
The last person I spoke to was New York Magazine creator 
Clay Felker who said Do it Just do it And I did she said 
I was ecstatic that I would be writing and working for women 
about whom I care a great deal 
During the late 1960s Lear founded Womens Place Inc a Los 
Angeles consulting firm She later began Lear Purvis Walker amp Co 
an executive search firm for women In 1984 as a partner in a 
political consulting firm she founded a division for women 
candidates 
The magazine she said is a fusion of my experience and the 
women Ive worked with for the past 25 years who ranged from 
welfare mothers to highly skilled executives 
Its the female executives or wives of executives who make 
up Lears guaranteed circulation of 200000 The first issue 
which ran 475000 copies was expected to sell out Market 
research shows the subscribers average household income is 92400 
Lear in fact is using her own money to start the magazine 
By the time its in the black she hopes in two to three years 
I will have spent 25 million she said 
Six issues are planned for this year and 10 for the second year 
The ads and richly colored highfashion spreads feature over40 
models whenever possible Theyre in scarce supply 
We believe that Lears will spark a whole culture she said 
Products instruction entertainment recreation this whole 
market will have their own world of toys to choose from 
The copy ranges from humor essays and fiction to advice on 
treasury bills and an interview with Philippine President Corazon 
Aquino who defends her feminine style in the political arena 
We have presented women over 40 who are absolutely beautiful 
and sensual and intelligent and characterful said Lear It 
informs it entertains it impels inspires 
The feminism is softpedaled The militant views of the early 
feminists are long gone and feminism is settling into a more 
middleoftheroad posture she said But the word feminist 
still conjures up witches in some minds 
Profiles mention the potholes on a womans road to success 
difficult upbringing multiple divorces adjustment to the aging 
process Good marriages also get a mention 
It is noteworthy to have a happy marriage I think all 
women are basically traditional and want love and home and 
family said Lear And a divorce is a major event in a persons 
life To leave it out would be to leave out ones education 
Lear said 17 percent of her readers are under 30 They say 
We want to know what its like to be 40 
I believe the second half of ones life is meant to be better 
than the first half she said The first half is finding out 
how you do it And the second half is enjoying it
