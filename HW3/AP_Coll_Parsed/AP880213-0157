The European Economic Community on 
Saturday reached an agreement to end its cash crisis by limiting 
farm subsidies putting the trading bloc on course toward a bigger 
role in the international economy 
The deal also has allowed the group to step back from political 
stalemate at a time when improved relations between the superpowers 
have stirred new efforts by Western Europe to reassert itself on 
the world stage 
Even so few of the European leaders who worked out the 
fourpoint agreement were willing to predict how long the new 
momentum would last 
Dont get too cheerful said British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher who has been at the center of a series of fierce 
negotiating battles to limit EEC spending since she took office in 
1979 
She and leaders of the 11 other EEC or Common Market countries 
said the Brussels accord while important for its new approach to 
controlling farm spending did not necessarily mean the Common 
Market had seen its final budget crisis 
Over the past decade bickering over money has been the main 
cause of stagnation in the EEC It has retarded the organizations 
development and hampered its efforts to keep up with a 
fastchanging world economy 
The financial pressure will ease now assuming the Brussels 
agreement is as expected ratified by the 12 national parliaments 
and implemented as drafted 
It was the first time in the EECs 31year history that leaders 
fixed a limit to farm spending which eats up twothirds of the 
EECs annual budget The agreement set a 344 billion limit on 
farm spending in 1988 slightly higher than last year 
The deal contains four main points 
Subsidies to grain producers will for the first time be 
legally limited If effective the system of production ceilings 
and punitive price cuts for farmers will ease one of the EECs 
biggest farm problems 
The total budget of the EEC will grow substantially by 
revamping the way member countries chip in from national 
treasuries The new system will gradually make the governments 
contributions correspond more closely to their national wealth 
Aid to the groups poorest members will be increase by 80 
percent over five years This serves two main purposes to put all 
the members on a more even economic footing and to help the poorer 
ones cope with stiffer foreign competition once the Common Market 
has completed its drive to remove all internal barriers to trade by 
1992 
Annual increases in overall farm spending will for the first 
time be strictly limited Under a new formula each 10 percent 
increase in the EECs total economic output would allow a 74 
percent rise in the budget 
Mrs Thatcher said she would approve only if EEC foreign 
ministers approve additional controls on farm subsidies That 
should happen soon 
The summit accord was reached in the early hours Saturday after 
two full days of debate Two previous EEC summits last June and 
December had failed to bridge gaps between an austerityminded 
faction led by Britain and a West Germanled group that wanted 
looser spending controls 
The previous failures had left the Common Market without a 
formal budget for this year It was due to run out of money by late 
summer 
Henning Christophersen the EEC budget commissioner said 
Saturday that the EEC could get its 1988 budget approved by the 
European Parliament by May Leaders of the 518member legislature 
which shares the budget writing authority with the member 
governments have given the reforms a grudging approval 
While the immediate crisis now appears to have passed future 
harmony is not assured 
A fundamental split remains in the member countries views about 
how far the Common Market should go in transforming itself from a 
trading bloc dealing mainly with economic issues to a true 
political union 
Britain stresses the need to remove trade barriers between EEC 
countries to give European business a wider home market from 
which to compete on a global scale with the United States and 
Japan The Brussels accord is likely to make this goal more 
attainable 
France and other members want to keep alive the dreams of the 
EECs founding fathers to create a single political entity a kind 
of United States of Europe in which the 12 member countries would 
share common foreign defense and economic policies 
Reflecting this hope Jacques Delors the EECs chief executive 
and a former French finance minister told reporters that the 
significance of the Brussels accord went beyond the issues of 
budgets and agriculture 
We now have the political tool for the relaunching of the 
European union he said 
Still the EECs track record would suggest that new progress 
toward political integration will come only gradually and only 
after new unforeseen financial crises emerge and threaten serious 
setbacks
