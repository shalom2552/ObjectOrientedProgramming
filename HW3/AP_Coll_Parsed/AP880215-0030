A new study from the World Bank says explosive 
population growth in subSaharan Africa is putting tremendous 
strains on primary schools that spend only 48 a year per pupil 
The 39 countries in Africa face the need to expand schools that 
can teach 51 million children to take care of nearly 91 million by 
the year 2000 
The resources available have been stretched thinner as the 
population soared Per pupil spending after discounting for 
inflation fell from 67 a year in 1970 to 48 in 1983 the report 
said In many countries peoples average incomes also are declining 
In four countries Somalia Togo Mozambique and Angola the 
number of youngsters registering for school actually went down even 
as population figures raced ahead 
Overall one child in four in subSaharan Africa is not enrolled 
in school at all and the ranks are growing 
In the United States spending on elementary and secondary 
schools averages more than 4000 per pupil each year The schools 
spend almost as much on each student in two class days as these 
African countries spend in an entire year 
The bank is the biggest single source of aid to help Third World 
countries raise their living standards Its report says donors 
should get together and help more 
A child reaching school age in Somalia at the northeastern tip 
of the continent had about one chance in six of finding a teacher 
in 1983 
The number of high school students there has risen but in 1983 
there were still only about 63000 in a population of 5 or 6 
million 
The report says Africas explosive population growth greatly 
increases the number of children seeking access to schools and 
increases the number of potential illiterates 
The stock of human capital in Africa will determine whether 
Africans can harness the universal explosion of scientific and 
technical knowledge for the regions benefit or whether Africa 
will fall farther and farther behind the worlds industrial 
nations 
Peter R Moock who led the team that compiled the study said 
in an interview that Somalia is an extreme case According to the 
report fewer than 12 percent of adult Somalis could read in 1983 
Primary school teachers were paid 985 a year The government was 
spending about 6 percent of its budget on education less than 21 
million and that share had been dropping for years 
By comparison it spent 114 million for its military a figure 
that rose to 134 million in 1985 
Across Africa the number of students of all ages quintupled 
between 1960 and 1983 The report said that in 19 of the 39 
countries the primaryschool age population six to 11 was 
growing faster than the number of children entering school 
In 13 countries including Nigeria the most populous on the 
continent a smaller proportion was enrolled in primary schools in 
1983 than in 1980 
In many respects 1983 was the worst year of the economic 
crisis and it is possible that a number of educational indicators 
have subsequently begun to improve the report notes 
It says improving education would pay off even from a purely 
material point of view 
Farmers who have completed four years of education produce on 
average about 8 percent more farm output than farmers who have not 
gone to school the report says 
It quotes other studies as showing that babies are more likely 
to survive if their mother has at least a few years of education 
Educated people are more likely to be mobile moving from less 
productive jobs to better ones and sending money back home when 
they migrate They are also likely to be healthier and to live 
longer 
The reports recommendations include 
More spending on education by African countries themselves 
with emphasis on books and materials new methods such as radio 
broadcasts and correspondence schools 
Improvement of school principals with more autonomy and 
better achievement testing 
More foreign aid and better coordination with a larger 
proportion for primary schools less for higher education and 
overseas fellowships
