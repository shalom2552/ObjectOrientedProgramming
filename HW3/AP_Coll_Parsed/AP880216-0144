Angolan army troops killed 
four South African soldiers in a clash in southern Angola South 
African army commander Gen Jamie Geldenhuys said Tuesday 
Geldenhuys said the soldiers were killed during the weekend when 
Angolan troops fired a Sovietmade antiaircraft gun at a vehicle 
in which the soldiers were riding but gave no further details 
about the time or place 
His statement Tuesday was the first confirmation from South 
Africa of repeated reports from the Marxist Angolan government that 
South African forces were still fighting in support of the Angolan 
rebel movement UNITA 
Since the weekend UNITA has achieved resounding success and 
FAPLA the Angolan government army is now retreating in disarray 
and trying to organize a desperate last stand he said 
The Angolan Defense Ministry said South African forces launched 
a new attack east of the southern city of Cuito Cuanavale Sunday 
leaving considerable casualties on both sides Angolas 
staterun ANGOP news agency reported Tuesday 
The ANGOP report in a dispatch monitored in Lisbon Portugal 
apparently referred to the same battle 
The South Africans announced fighting a major battle in November 
against Cuban and Sovietled Angolan forces at Cuito Cuanavale 
and later reported the deaths of more than 40 South African and 
SouthWest African soldiers in Angola without specifying where or 
how they died 
Since announcing in December that its forces were withdrawing 
from Angola the South African Defense Force has refused to comment 
on Angolan government estimates of South African troop strength 
ANGOP quoted the Angolan Defense Ministry as estimating Tuesday 
that 7000 South African troops remained in Angolas southern 
CuandoCubango province after recent reinforcements 
ANGOP reported heavy fighting was still under way late Monday 12 
miles east of Cuito Cuanavale 
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi claimed his troops forced the 
government soldiers out of Cuito Cuanavale several weeks ago He 
said UNITA now surrounds the deserted town which had been the 
annual starting point for the governments dryseason offensives 
against rebel strongholds in the southeast 
The rebels also receive military aid from the United States 
while the government receives Soviet military aid and has a 
reported Cuban support force of 40000 regulars in the mineralrich 
nation 
In Lisbon Tuesday UNITA released a statement saying it has 
allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross to resume its 
activities in the warwracked southern African nation 
The note signed by UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi said the rebels 
authorized resumption of Red Cross activities to the Angolan 
people 
UNITA has been fighting a wideranging bush war since 1976 the 
year after Angola secured its independence from Portugal to force 
the government to share power
