Two US Navy warships have left the Black Sea 
after an incident last week in which they were deliberately bumped 
by Soviet ships off the coast of Crimea the Pentagon said Tuesday 
The cruiser Yorktown and the destroyer Caron steamed 
uneventfully through the Turkish Straits and back into the 
Mediterranean Sea on Monday the Pentagon said 
Spokesman Dan Howard declined to say where the two ships were 
now bound 
The Yorktown and Caron entered the Black Sea on Feb 10 under 
orders to assert international navigation rights As a result last 
Friday the two ships moved inside the 12mile limit claimed by the 
Soviet Union while steaming past the Crimea Peninsula 
In response two Soviet warships deliberately bump the sides of 
the Yorktown and Caron causing minor damage and prompting the 
United States to file a protest with Moscow 
Unlike the Soviet Union the United States claims a threemile 
territorial limit The United States accepts other nations claims 
of a 12mile limit but it insists that foreign nations honor what 
is known as the right of innocent passage for ships passing 
through waters between three and 12 miles offshore
