Investment in US agriculture will probably 
decline at least through the early 1990s because of the massive Tax 
Reform Act of 1986 according to a new study by the Agriculture 
Department 
Most of the investment decline can be laid to the laws repeal 
of the investment tax credit which allowed up to 10 percent tax 
credit for qualifying capital improvements the report said Friday 
Most farm machinery equipment many farm structures and certain 
livestock operations qualified for the full 10 percent credit 
The report Economic Consequences of Tax Reform on 
Agricultural Investment was prepared by Roger Conway Ron Durst 
James Hrubovcak and Michael LeBlanc of the departments Economic 
Research Service 
According to their study there was a decline in net farm 
investment of 29 billion in 1987 with repeal of the investment 
tax credit accounting for 98 percent of the reduction 
The annual reductions are expected to increase gradually through 
1991 when the net disinvestment in agriculture attributable to 
the 1986 law would be almost 35 billion 
Elimination of the investment tax credit increases the rental 
rate on farm machinery including tractors and other longlived 
equipment such as cultivators grain harvesters planters plows 
and shredders the report said 
The rental rate of capital is not the most important 
determinant of investment but it and therefore by implication 
tax policy does have a measurable effect on agricultural 
investment the report said 
According to other USDA material about the 1986 tax law farmers 
had been claiming more than 1 billion in investment tax credit 
annually One of those background papers noted 
However a large share of this 1 billion a year is claimed 
by individuals with taxable income in excess of 85000 and 
marginal tax rates of 45 percent or above Farms with gross 
receipts between 50000 and 500000 per year are able to claim 
less than half of the investment tax credit avabilable to them due 
to no current tax liability 
In its latest report the agency said history suggests that 
changes in the tax code are not permanent and that for example 
the investment tax credit has been revised four times since 1964 
Although no reasonable measure of change in the 1986 law can 
alter the current disinvestment of capital in agriculture 1988 
will probably bring forth strident efforts to reinstate the 
investment tax credit the report said

The National Association of Wheat Growers 
wants the Agriculture Department to ease back on acreage controls 
for the 1989 wheat crop 
Frank Johannsen association president said Friday that greater 
acreage should be permitted so the United States can keep filling a 
growing export demand For the last two years wheat farmers have 
been required to idle 275 percent of their base acreage in order 
to qualify for federal supports 
The USDA is to announce the 1989 wheat program by June 1 
Johannsen a wheat farmer from Bayard Neb said the association 
asks the acreage reduction be held to no more than 20 percent 
Johannsen said US wheat stockpiles are expected to drop by 30 
percent this season the largest annual decline in more than 20 
years 
A 1989 acreage reduction of less than 20 percent could be 
justified if USDA maintains its current export subsidy programs he 
said 
Since we dont know what will happen after the November 
elections our market outlook is somewhat cloudy thus making it 
more difficult to forecast export sales opportunities Johannsen 
said in a statement released here by the association

Price supports for peanuts grown under 1988 
quotas will be 61527 per ton an increase of 780 from last 
year the Agriculture Department has decided 
Deputy Secretary Peter C Myers said Friday the increase was 
required by a formula in the law which takes rising production 
costs into consideration 
The annual quota is set at a level equal to the estimated 
quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible uses 
seed and related purposes 
Production of nonquota peanuts which can be grown for peanut 
oil and meal and for export will be supported at 14975 per ton 
unchanged from last year Myers said 
In setting the support for nonquota peanuts officials are 
reqired to consider certain factors including the demand for oil 
and meal the expected prices for other vegetable oils and meals 
and the foreign demand for peanuts
