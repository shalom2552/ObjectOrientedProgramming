Pope John Paul II has written the seventh 
encyclical of his papacy a major document summarizing and updating 
the Roman Catholic Churchs concerns for social and economic 
justice 
The encyclical a letter addressed to church leaders will be 
released by the Vatican on Friday 
The document is entitled in Latin Sollicitudo Rei Socialis 
meaning the social concern of the church 
John Paul announced the document himself declaring in a speech 
in December that it was being written to coincide with the 20th 
anniversary of the social encyclical Populorum Progressio 
Development of Peoples published by Pope Paul VI in 1967 That 
document stressed the needs of Third World countries for a better 
deal from the developed world 
John Paul said the new encyclical would reveal the new themes 
and respond to the new problems of social development in the past 
two decades and that he hoped the document would spur concrete 
proposals for international cooperation 
The Rome newspaper La Repubblica said the document is expected 
to reflect the popes concerns for the excesses of both the 
freemarket capitalist and totalitarian systems and his emphasis on 
the importance of human values 
Throughout his papacy John Paul has stressed the human element 
in the productive process the primacy of people over things 
This was the theme of his other major social encyclical On 
Human Work issued in 1981 
During a visit to Canada in 1984 he delivered an indictment of 
unfettered capitalism and urged governments to reorder their 
economic priorities so that human needs were put before mere 
financial gain 
John Paul was following a tradition that has seen Catholic 
social teaching evolve to respond to the problems spawned by modern 
industrial society 
The encyclical Rerum Novarum Condition of the Working 
Classes issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 defended the right to hold 
private property but insisted that material goods had to meet the 
needs of all humanity 
Paul VIs 1967 encyclical took this further as it stressed the 
needs of the Third World and its economic development 
The encyclical proposed higher taxes on the rich regulation of 
world trade expropriation of large estates if they impeded general 
prosperity and the establishment of a world fund in which some of 
the money spent on arms would be used to ease poverty in the world 
Private property does not constitute for anyone an absolute 
and unconditioned right No one is justified in keeping for his 
exclusive use what he does not need when others lack 
necessities Paul VI wrote 
John Paul has used his encyclicals to criticize the materialism 
of communist and capitalist countries warn that the arms race 
threatens the destruction of mankind and to condemn atheism and 
Marxism 
In addition to the encylical on work the others were titled 
Christ the Redeemer 1979 The Father of Mercy 1980 
Apostles of the Slavs 1985 The Holy Spirit the Giver of 
Life 1986 and The Mother of the Redeemer 1987
