Pierce Brosnan whod never been to Asia 
before started last year with a miniseries in Hong Kong and ended 
it with a movie in India 
In between he returned to his native Ireland to do an 
independent film with some friends 
The miniseries Noble House starts its eighthour 
fourpart run on NBC this Sunday Its based on the bestselling 
book by James Clavell 
The movie in India is The Deceivers from the book by John 
Masters The Irish movie is Taffin 
In Noble House Brosnan stars as Ian Dunross the taipan 
or boss of Hong Kongs leading trading house It also stars 
Deborah Raffin Ben Masters John Houseman John RhysDavies and 
Julia Nickson Gary Nelson directed it on location in Hong Kong for 
12 weeks and at the Dino De Laurentiis Studio in North Carolina for 
another 12 weeks 
Hong Kong was my first step into the Orient said Brosnan 
Its a fascinating place sort of a condensed version of New York 
City My schedule was such that I had time to go around and see the 
place I bought an automatic camera and did some photography 
What was around me was so exciting to look at and so 
different The colors and the light were magical Having started 
life as a commercial artist Ive always looked at things as though 
to paint them I used a zoom lens because the Chinese dont like 
having their pictures taken 
As the story opens Dunross has just taken over the familys 
trading empire 
Hes fairly ruthless in his dealings with people said 
Brosnan He has a remoteness to him An isolated charm Ive 
never played a character like him before The job came at a very 
opportune moment after the whole incident of James Bond and 
Remington Steele 
After NBC canceled Remington Steele a few seasons back 
Brosnan was asked to become the next James Bond Roger Moore had 
decided to step down as 007 Then because of the publicity over 
Bond NBC put Remington Steele back on the schedule and 
Brosnan was dropped from the Bond picture 
Did he see the offer of the role in Noble House as a peace 
offering 
I never thought of it as a peace offering he answered I 
saw it as a way of putting as much distance between myself and 
Remington Steele as possible Id always enjoyed doing the 
series but I knew coming back for six more episodes was hogwash 
They wanted to have their cake and eat it 
The turmoil for me was the on and off anxiety of the Bond 
part It lasted an eternity I was offered James Bond I said yes 
Remington Steele was brought back Thats enough to say on the 
subject It was a shame because Remington Steele was never 
allowed to finish with any grace 
As it turned out Timothy Dalton was hired to play James Bond in 
The Living Daylights Brosnan said he sees no chance that he 
will ever play the role 
His wife Cassandra Harris was Moores leading lady in the Bond 
movie For Your Eyes Only 
Brosnans India movie The Deceivers is set in 1824 and 
focuses on the Thugs who worshipped the god of destruction Kali 
I play an Englishman a glorified accountant working for the 
East India Trading Co he said He discovers this cult and 
disguises himself as an Indian He goes on the road with the Thugs 
who kill people by strangulation 
Brosnans only current appearances on TV are in a commercial for 
Diet Coke which was premiered during the Super Bowl coverage It 
was filmed on a speeding train in England and looks like a scene 
right out of a spy thriller such as a Bond movie or perhaps The 
Fourth Protocol in which Brosnan played a Soviet agent being 
tracked down by Michael Caine 
That was me walking on top of that train he said It was 
going 40 miles an hour If Id fallen off that sucker Id never 
have done The Deceivers
