A convicted IRA bomber serving a life 
sentence married his American sweetheart Friday in a simple 
ceremony in the prison chapel 
Paul Hill 33 has been imprisoned for 14 years for bombings 
that killed seven people in England and injured 85 He says he is 
innocent and is hoping his conviction will be overturned by a new 
police inquiry 
Hill was allowed to chat briefly with his bride Marion 
Severelli of New Jersey after the short ceremony conducted by a 
Roman Catholic chaplain at Long Lartin Jail 110 miles northwest of 
London 
He was then returned to his cell But he was allowed to 
celebrate with his bride and about 15 guests at a brief reception 
later during which the couple cut a wedding cake 
A prison spokesman said no alcohol was served and the couple 
remained under the watchful eye of prison officers 
Ms Severelli a buyer for a paper mill first wrote to Hill 
three years ago with news that a friend of his had died After a 
year of writing she flew to Britain to meet him 
When I first saw him he was just about everything I thought 
he would be gentle and feeling she said He is not at all 
cynical even though he is not guilty and has been locked up for 
almost 14 years 
Ms Severelli said she is convinced her husband is innocent and 
hopes he will be able to join her in the United States if he is 
ever released 
She did not give her age or hometown and the information was not 
immediately available from prison officials 
Bombs exploded in October 1974 in two pubs in the town of 
Guildford near London killing four soldiers and a civilian and 
injuring about 50 other people The following month a bomb blew up 
in a pub in the London district of Woolwich killing two people and 
injuring 35 others All three pubs were frequented by military 
personnel 
Responsibility for the bombings was claimed by the Irish 
Republican Army The group is fighting to end British rule in 
Protestantdominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with 
the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic 
Hill was one of four people convicted of the pub bombings The 
socalled Guildford Four have always maintained their innocence 
Last July Home Secretary Douglas Hurd ordered a police inquiry 
into the bombings after receiving statements from a delegation led 
by Cardinal Basil Hume head of the Roman Catholic Church in 
England and Wales that expressed concern about the verdicts 
Ms Severelli said she and her husband had discussed the 
possibility that he might spend the rest of his life in jail but 
they decided last spring to get married anyway 
I dont know if he will get justice in a British court But I 
believe that good will triumph she was quoted as telling The 
Guardian newspaper on Friday 
Ms Severelli has been staying at the Evesham Prison Visitor 
Center to meet the residential qualification for the wedding She 
is expected to return to the United States next week
