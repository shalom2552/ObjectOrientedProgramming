A large windowless room here has witnessed 
the assassination of an overbearing naval commander and mass 
firings when officers failed to follow orders It has seen treaties 
broken and weapons used up 
But not a drop of blood has been spilled The room on the campus 
of the Naval War College is used for war games a serious pastime 
that draws participants from around the world 
Players call their activity aided by maps and computers fun 
and exhilarating But war gaming is played as the next best thing 
to the real thing and even the scenarios are top secret 
We try to stimulate the thinking process of these players 
said Navy Cmdr Tim Barker who acts as umpire keeping players 
within the confines of the possible and showing them the 
consequences of their decisions 
Should I make my boats report Should I move my boats into the 
area Should we respond to terrorist activity All these things are 
being played out he said 
On occasion war games are handy in light of current events 
When the United States began providing naval protection last 
summer to USflagged oil tankers in the Persian Gulf the war 
gaming staff played it out 
We didnt come up with any surprises said Capt Joseph 
Hurlburt who has since retired as head of the college war gaming 
department He wouldnt elaborate but shook his head no when 
asked if the Persian Gulf situation might explode 
But war gaming cant predict all reallife actions as shown by 
a letter displayed in the lobby that was written to the war 
college by Adm Chester Nimitz commander in the Pacific during 
World War II 
The war with Japan had been reenacted in the game rooms at 
the Naval War College by so many people and in so many different 
ways Nimitz wrote that nothing that happened during the war 
was a surprise absolutely nothing except the Japanese suicide 
kamikaze tactics toward the end of the war we had not visualized 
these 
Often games produce no clear winner Instead the objective is 
to test theories develop trends build consensus and assess 
technology and logistics and to give War College students an arena 
in which to practice what theyve learned 
When a war game is on the building is offlimits to outsiders 
But during a recent rare visit monitor screens blinked with 
numbers and in big red letters the word CLASSIFIED Other 
screens showed maps indicating the locations of ships submarines 
and aircraft 
The notion of twosided war games in which players pretend to be 
the adversary is relatively modern It was invented early in this 
century in Prussia and refined between the two world wars 
Today war games are sometimes played in seminars where the 
armaments and battle lines are drawn in the imagination But the 
Naval War College prides itself on its use of computers as a 
resource for reality They give more dimension to the simulation by 
bringing in political variables and millions of facts 
Computers hold the information from which the gamesters recreate 
the world including statistics on the shape and climate of ports 
the inclinations of their inhabitants and the details of other 
countries ships aircraft and bombs 
The number of players varies greatly from a dozen to hundreds 
depending on the complexity 
Each summer World War III begins anew played out in three weeks 
with 1200 participants There are NATO games and games with other 
allies 
Players are assigned to a force in computerequipped rooms 
called cells One is designated the red cell for Communist 
forces Cmdr Robert Simeral is a Navy intelligence expert with 
intimate knowledge of the Soviet Union so he often plays the 
Soviet side 
The goal of the red cell is to play a consistent red threat 
However you can never really crack the skulls of the Soviets he 
said pointing up a flaw inherent in war games the best you can 
do is imitate the enemy 
Each game takes on a life of its own animated by the players 
and their options Simeral said Tempers flare People get fired 
Military leaders get upset with the civilian command You get an 
acting president firing a commander in charge of the Pacific for 
contradicting policy 
The professional warriors all stressed that the ultimate 
objective of trying out such scenarios is to keep the peace Said 
Barker We dont necessarily want a good juicy war but to make 
people think about it
