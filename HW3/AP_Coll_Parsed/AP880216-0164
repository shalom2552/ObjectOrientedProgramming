Police and civilian auxiliary officers 
patrolled near churches a historic cemetery and in the center of 
this Baltic capital Tuesday preventing demonstrations to mark 
Lithuanias brief independence 
Jadvyga Beliauskiene a Roman Catholic activist told reporters 
shortly before midnight Monday that four Lithuanian nationalists 
were under house arrest to stop them from leading protests 
A high profile by police showing a harder line by Soviet 
authorities against expressions of Baltic nationalism seemed to 
deter any largescale showing of national feeling 
Western reporters brought to Vilnius by the Soviet Foreign 
Ministry for a governmentapproved visit were followed constantly 
in cars and on foot as they visited Lithuanian activists and 
traveled through winding medieval streets to visit sites where 
protests had been scheduled 
Ms Beliauskiene a former member of an anticommunist partisan 
movement in the 1940s who spent 12 years in prison was one of 
about 200 people who signed a petition to Soviet leader Mikhail S 
Gorbachev in January asking that authorities not terrorize 
people who wanted to celebrate Lithuanian independence 
Tuesday marked the 70th anniversary of Lithuanias declaration 
of independence from Soviet Russia months after the Bolshevik 
revolution brought the Communists to power Lithuania was 
independent until it was absorbed by the Soviet Union in 1940 
In Moscow the officials Soviet news agency Tass said US 
Ambassador Jack Matlock on Tuesday declined to receive official 
representatives of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic who 
came to protest US interference in the republics internal 
affairs 
Thirtytwo US Senators have written to Gorbachev asking him 
not to interfere with this weeks demonstrations and religious 
services in the Soviet republics of Lithuania and Estonia 
The statecontrolled Soviet news media has criticized similar 
congressional statements in the past for inciting public 
demonstrations in the Baltic republics 
 
Activists called on citizens to pray at two Vilnius churches and 
lay flowers at a monument to PolishLithuanian writer Adam 
Mickiewicz and the grave of Jonas Basanavicius a doctor and 
champion of the Lithuanian language who died 61 years ago on Feb 
16 1927 
The monument to Mickiewicz was the scene of a demonstration on 
Aug 23 marking the anniversary of the 1939 GermanSoviet 
nonaggression pact that consigned most of Lithuania to Soviet 
control 
We want to raise the consciousness of people so they remember 
they have the right to be free said Ms Beliauskiene 59 who 
works as a file clerk in a government AIDS laboratory 
Witnesses said one woman was led away by police after she laid 
flowers at the monument to Mickiewicz on Tuesday evening But they 
said she apparently was not arrested 
Nijole Sadunaite a Roman Catholic activist who spent six years 
in prison and exile for her role in distributing religious 
literature met reporters Monday night in the stairwell of an 
apartment house guarded by uniformed and plainclothes police 
A uniformed officer told reporters that if they entered the 
apartment they would be responsible for anything that happened to 
Ms Sadunaite 49 
Ms Sadunaite said KGB agents had attacked her ripping the 
buttons from her coat and punching her in the stomach She said her 
only goal was to honor the memory of the dear Lithuanian people 
who died for our independence 
We dont use tanks we dont use machine guns we dont even 
use profanity she said nervously Even if they strike us we 
do not strike back 
Kaunas Lithuanias secondlargest city also appeared quiet 
Mayor Petras Staskunas told Western reporters who visited the 
city that dissident reports that nationalists had been injured in a 
scuffle with police on Sunday were not true 
There were no incidents in Kaunas on Sunday We know these 
emigre organizations want things to happen here but nothing has 
happened he said We know there are extremists in this city 
We wont hide it But they have no influence or support 
At the Rasu Cemetery in the snowcovered hills near the center 
of Vilnius at least 18 policemen in gray coats and fur hats and 
auxiliary policemen wearing red armbands stood near the black 
granite pillar that marks the grave of Basanavicius 
Bouquets of tulips and a lily had been placed on the grave and a 
solitary candle flickered in the chilly morning breeze but there 
were no protesters 
One of the two auxiliary policemen guarding the graveyards 
whitewashed stone gate said Were here to keep up order 
Asked why so many police were deployed on the streets and at the 
historic sites a member of the Vilnius Soviets or local 
government said We have a saying in Lithuanian One drop of tar 
will spoil the whole jar of honey 
Police patrols of up to five members each strolled along Lenin 
Prospekt the major shopping thoroughfare in this city of 600000 
people 
About 20 worshipers mostly elderly women wearing kerchiefs 
against the cold attended 730 am Mass at St Annes one of the 
churches where activists had called for Lithuanians to pray 
Beside the red brick Gothic church which dates from the late 
14th century 15 policemen and auxiliary officers stood guard at 
the monument to Mickiewicz
