Two scientists who reported isolating an 
AIDSrelated human virus say they now think some original samples 
were probably monkey virus but that scientific conclusions about 
it remain unchanged 
Myron Essex and Phyllis Kanki of the Harvard School of Public 
Health writing in Thursdays issue of the British journal Nature 
say certain virus samples they reported in 1986 as HTLVIV from 
healthy Africans should be considered an AIDS virus from monkeys 
instead 
Their virus has since been found in humans 
It is now considered to be HIV2 a virus restricted chiefly to 
West Africa that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome The 
AIDS virus found in the United States is called HIV1 
The Harvard scientists statement accompanies a report by 
researchers at the New England Regional Primate Center in 
Southborough Mass The report gives evidence that original HTLVIV 
samples were actually monkey virus that had contaminated human 
cells in the laboratory 
The study reports unusually strong similarities between the 
HTLVIV samples and a simian immunodeficiency virus found in 
macaques 
Essex in a telephone interview said the new data made it 
likely that some original HTLVIV samples were monkey virus He 
also said he knew of no subsequent studies that would have to be 
considered invalid because of the mistake 
In a Nature editorial Carel Mulder of the University of 
Massachusetts Medical School at Worcester said the original 
misidentification will not affect results of epidemiological 
studies of the virus by Essex and Kanki 
But the incident should serve as a warning to virologists he 
wrote He said he knew of or has been told of at least five 
instances in other American and European laboratories where cells 
were accidentally infected with HIV1 in the laboratory 
In the past several scientists have said they suspected 
laboratory contamination in the original report of HTLVIV
