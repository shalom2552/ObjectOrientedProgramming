Meet Richard M Marcus the gourmet 
peanutbutter entrepreneur whos nuts about his job 
I come in here every day and think Thank God This is 
marvelous Its the most exciting thing Ive ever done in my life 
Somedays Im just bursting he says before climbing a metal 
ladder and ducking his head into a 700pound vat of dryroasted 
peanuts 
Marcus is a former symphony conductor piano teacher and nursery 
school administrator who spent the better part of his adult life 
yearning for the gooey oldfashioned taste of the peanut butter he 
remembered from childhood 
Which is why he started grinding peanut butter in his wifes 
blender 25 years ago 
And it is why he sells a couple of million dollars worth of his 
speciality peanut butter in supermarkets gourmet shops and 
healthfood stores from Maryland to Connecticut 
I was making it and giving it to my friends my students my 
dentist in little 1ounce jars Listen 1 ounces of peanut 
butter is a lot of work when youre making it by hand Anyway 
people kept saying You ought to sell this said the 
58yearold president of CR Foods Inc during a recent interview 
He paused to look at several onepound jars of Crazy Richards 
Peanut Butter that line his paneled office at the Camden County 
plant Then breaking into a rich belly laugh he shrugged Who 
knew 
Certainly not Marcus who studied conducting with Leonard 
Bernstein and toured as the musical director of the Royal Winnipeg 
Ballet before coming home to Philadelphia to teach piano to 
children 
But even as he toured the world as a musician he kept looking 
for a peanut butter made from just plain 100 percent peanuts just 
like it says today on every one of his brownandorange labels 
The truth is it really doesnt require those additives Peanut 
butter does not have to be salted sweetened or stabilized What 
the hecks wrong with the oil rising to the top Just take a table 
knife and stir it down Meanwhile what you have is a purer form of 
food he said 
He learned he wasnt the only person who liked his specialty 
line of peanut butter made sans sugar salt and oil 
In 1973 he started making his peanut butter with the help of a 
plant in Conshocken Pa a suburb of Philadelphia 
By 1979 he sold a private school which he had started in 
Philadelphia and turned to making peanut butter full time first at 
a rented facility in Pennsauken and now at the plant he bought last 
year in this New Jersey suburb of Philadelphia 
In his first year he sold 18000 cases Now he says hes 
selling more than twice that amount annually 
We will sell between threequarters of a million to 1 million 
jars this year Its very exciting especially when you realize 
this is something I started in the back of my car with 144 jars 
he said 
The kitchen blender has long been retired and replaced by a 1910 
grinding machine that churns out about 4000 gallons of Crazy 
Richards Peanut Butter on a good day when the line is running and 
all eight of the plants employees are on hand 
This machine doesnt know how to make modernday peanut 
butter It couldnt even if we wanted to said Marcus who 
stopped eating the modern stuff in the 1940s when homogenization 
was introduced to peanut butter manufacturing 
Homogenization breaks down the fat particles and blends the fat 
throughout the rest of the product Marcus unhomogenized peanut 
butter has swirls of oil floating on top which in his words 
defines real peanut butter 
Marcus says the homogenizing process altered once and for 
all the taste of peanut butter in America 
Sometimes Im amazed there was no public outcry he said 
Everything was homogenized in those days Nobody knew what it 
meant but if it didnt have it they wouldnt buy it he said 
There are three products in his line creamy chunky and 
chocolateflavored peanut butter None is homogenized all are his 
favorites 
I usually have it for breakfast If you have it for breakfast 
you dont need lunch It really quells the appetite he said 
while briskly strolling past pallets piled with burlap bags of 
peanuts or cardboard cases of the finished product 
He attributes much of his success to entering the market just at 
a time when the backtonature movement was emerging in the 1970s 
Processing changes the consistency and flavor of food Here 
you get it in the natural state he said adding that luck also 
seemed to play a major role in his success 
Crazy Richard although a regional food product is slowly 
expanding its market It opened its national mailorder business in 
December with three small advertisments in the New Yorker magazine 
According to Marcus the calls are still coming in
