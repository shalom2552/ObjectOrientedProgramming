Leaders of white supremacist groups 
discussed poisoning the water of New York and Washington to 
undermine the government a prosecutor said today in his opening 
statement at the trial of 14 supremacists 
Authorities contend the defendants sought to establish an Aryan 
nation and robbed bombed killed counterfeited and committed 
other crimes from July 1983 to April 1985 to reach their goal 
Ten defendants are accused of conspiracy to overthrow the 
government by force Five are accused of a conspiracy to kill a 
federal judge and an FBI agent and two are accused of transporting 
across state lines money stolen from an armored truck in California 
in 1984 
The defendants have been identified by the government as members 
of rightwing racist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and The Order 
In his opening argument in US District Court Assistant US 
Attorney Steve Snyder told the allwhite jury that the poisoning 
scheme was discussed by defendants James Ellison and Robert Miles 
on one occasion in 1983 and Ellison and Richard Butler on another 
Ellison had about 200 pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession at 
that time Snyder said 
Miles 63 of Cohoctah Mich and Butler 69 of Hayden Lake 
Idaho are considered two of the top three supremacist leaders The 
third Louis Ray Beam Jr 41 of Houston also is on trial 
Snyder told the jury that Beam in a speech at a 1983 white 
supremacist gathering called for war against the government and 
said If you dont help me kill them youre going to have to 
beg for your own childs life and the answer will be no 
Snyder said Miles made a speech urging the use of robberies to 
finance supremacist activities Over the next 18 months six 
robberies by supremacists netted more than 4 million the 
prosecutor said 
The library at Butlers Church of Jesus Christ Christian Aryan 
Nations contained books with titles like these Snyder said How 
To Kill Vols 16 Unconventional War The Anarchists 
Handbook 
Several of the defendants are serving prison sentences and are 
representing themselves although they also have courtappointed 
attorneys 
During selection of 12 jurors and six alternates Tuesday the 
three blacks among the 64 potential jurors were eliminated through 
the use of peremptory challenges in which lawyers can strike a 
limited number of people from the panel without showing cause 
The judge declined a defense attorneys request Tuesday to ask 
black prospective jurors whether they would be fair to defendants 
who believe in separation of the races and in white supremacy 
Beam is a former grand dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan 
in Texas Texas authorities said Beam led a campaign of violent 
intimidation of Vietnamese fishermen in the Galveston area In a 
letter obtained by government agents Beam said the United States 
was under the control of a Zionist Occupation Government 
Butler leads a church that has attracted some white 
supremacists including some who formed The Order whose members 
turned to violence to bring about the downfall of the national 
government say government investigators 
Miles is head of the Mountain Church of Jesus Christ the Savior 
at Cohoctah A former grand dragon of the KKK in Michigan Miles
