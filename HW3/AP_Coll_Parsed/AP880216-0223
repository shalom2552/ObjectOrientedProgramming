Northrop Corp said Tuesday its earnings rose 
275 percent in the fourth quarter and 129 percent for the year 
primarily because of money saved from the cancellation of its F20 
Tigershark program 
The results also reflected a higher level of research and 
development on several classified projects for the Pentagon 
For the three months ended Dec 31 the company earned 349 
million or 74 cents per share compared to a year earlier when it 
netted 93 million or 20 cents per share 
Revenue for the most recent period rose 66 percent to 177 
billion from 166 billion 
For the full year the companys profits jumped to 942 
million or 201 per share compared to 412 million or 89 cents 
per share while revenue rose 78 percent to 605 billion from 
561 billion 
The major factor in the increased earnings the company said 
was the absence of spending on the F20 a fighter canceled in late 
1986 Those costs totaled 236 million in 1986 including 105 
million in the fourth quarter 
Northrop poured more than 1 billion in its own money into 
developing the F20 which was designed primarily for foreign 
countries as a lowercost alternative to the F15 and F16 But it 
was never able to find any buyers 
However 1987 results were depressed by a secondquarter 125 
million writedown on a classified government project widely 
believed to be the Stealth bomber 
Northrop earnings also were depressed by an unspecified amount 
as the company continued to pump its own funds into developing a 
prototype of the Air Forces 21st century warplane the Advanced 
Tactical Fighter 
Northrop and Lockheed are leading competing teams of defense 
contractors seeking a 40 billion production contract for the ATF 
Aerospace was Northrops only business to show improvement It 
had an operating profit of 592 million in the fourth period 
comared to a loss of 48 million a year earlier For the full 
year it earned 2201 million compared to 66 million in 1986 
The companys electronics unit saw operating profits drop to 
236 million from 368 million for the quarter and to 70 million 
from 997 million for the year primarily because of lower revenue 
and profit margins on the MX missile program 
The companys aerospace services segment posted a loss of 
300000 for the quarter compared to a profit of 43 million a 
year earlier For all of 1987 its profit was 103 million less 
than half its 1986 level of 215 million
