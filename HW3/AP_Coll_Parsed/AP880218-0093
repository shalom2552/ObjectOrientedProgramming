The Reagan administration today issued an 
economic forecast any Republican presidential candidate could run 
on with pride predicting a record sixth year of peacetime economic 
growth with no increase in inflation 
The administration which in the past has been derided for its 
rosy scenarios of future economic activity presented an 
optimistic view that the current expansion will continue into the 
indefinite future And it derided initial recession fears from the 
October stock market crash as greatly exaggerated 
Despite the sharp reversal in stock prices however the real 
economy has shown few signs of serious damage the budget 
forecast stated 
While the economic assumptions that underpin the presidents 
1989 budget are more optimistic than the predictions made by the 
Congressional Budget Office and most private forecasters they are 
not as far from the general consensus as in previous years 
Indeed the administration boasts that its economic forecast a 
year ago which was also above the general consensus turned out to 
be closer to right 
The economy as measured by the gross national product grew 38 
percent in 1987 when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 The 
administration had predicted 32 percent growth 
Most forecasters failed to anticipate the magnitude of the 
improvement in the manufacturing sector just then getting under 
way the budget stated 
For 1988 the administration predicts manufacturing will remain 
a source of strength with export sales continuing to rise because 
of the weaker dollar 
The administration predicts the overall economy will expand at a 
24 percent annual rate this year with much of that growth coming 
from the improving trade deficit 
This compares to a CB0 growth forecast of 18 percent The CBO 
forecast is the same as the consensus view of 51 top economists 
surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators an investment newsletter 
Among the economic assumptions the administration predicts 
GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 35 percent rate and stay 
above 3 percent through 1993 
Consumer inflation which rose 44 percent last year will rise 
by 43 percent this year and decline steadily over the next four 
years to a 2 percent rate in 1993 
Unemployment because of the modest growth will show no 
improvement this year remaining at 58 percent at the close of the 
year matching the current level However the jobless rate will 
begin declining modestly in future years dropping to 55 percent 
in 1989 
These assumptions provide the basis for the administrations 
hopes of making further progress in getting the federal budget 
under control 
The 1989 spending plan Reagans eighth submission to Congress 
has a valedictory quality about it reviewing in detail the 
presidents economic goals when he took office in 1981 and trying 
to explain the reasons for Reagans biggest economic failure the 
string of record budget deficits 
The administration as it has in the past put much of the blame 
on Congress for failing to enact its domestic spending cuts But 
the budget also says the 198182 deficit played a large role 
adding 112 billion to the deficit in 1983 alone 
The new budget calls for reducing the federal deficit to 1295 
billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct 1 down from an 
actual budget deficit of 1502 billion in the 1987 fiscal year and 
an estimated deficit of 1467 billion for the current fiscal year 
The 1987 deficit was originally put at 148 billion but was 
revised in todays budget document 
The 1989 budget estimate is below the target of 136 billion 
called for in the GrammRudman deficitreduction law but the 
administration concedes that its estimates in the past have fallen 
victim to worsethanexpected economic performance 
Those pitfalls could derail the current plan as well the 
administration says noting that if GNP growth is just 1 percent 
lower than the administration is forecasting over the next five 
years it would add 63 billion to the 1989 deficit and 66 billion 
to the 1993 deficit 
A minority of economists is predicting an even worse outcome for 
this year forecasting the economy will fall into an actual 
recession 
If growth is slower than the administration forecasts or in a 
worstcase scenario the country does enter a recession then that 
would mean smaller federal tax revenues and higher spending for 
such programs as unemployment benefits 
The current economic recovery began in December 1982 following 
the worst recession since the Great Depression and is now in its 
63rd month surpassing the old record for a peacetime recovery of 
59 months set between 1975 and 1979
