Democratic presidential candidates 
Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt swapped charges and drew fire 
from the rest of the pack Saturday in a highvoltage debate 
reflecting the importance of Tuesdays leadoff New Hampshire 
primary 
Gephardt the narrow winner in Monday nights Iowa caucuses 
apologized to Sen Albert Gore Jr for profane remarks made by his 
campaign manager 
But when Gephardt complained that commercials being run by Paul 
Simons campaign were over the line he was brought up short by 
Gore 
What Paul Simon has done is simply to spell out the record 
And you ought to respond to the substance rather than taking it 
personally said the Tennessee senator 
Dukakis the runaway frontrunner in the polls for next weeks 
primary came out swinging with an attack on Gephardts acceptance 
of contributions from political action committees and his call for 
an oil import fee But then he was forced to field criticism from 
Gary Hart and Bruce Babbitt both men struggling for survival in 
the presidential race 
Dukakis and Gephardt were the frequent targets of barbs because 
of their position in the race the Massachusetts governor as 
frontrunner in the New Hampshire polls and the Missouri 
congressman as victor in Iowa 
Gore continued his assault on Gephardt after the event ended He 
told reporters his rival has changed an incredible list of 
positionsOf course its fair for Paul Simon to say your 
positions are 180 degrees different he said 
Jesse Jackson and Gephardt engaged in an intense conversation 
afterwards with Jackson waving his finger at his campaign 
competitor Neither man would say what they were talking about 
Jackson sought to play peacemaker during the debate as he urged 
his rivals to address the issues rather than engaging in a game of 
how bruised I am 
It was Babbitt the former Arizona governor who spoke most 
frankly about the importance of New Hampshire where he said voters 
have the power of life and death over my candidacy 
In a bid to attract voters from the audience watching the debate 
on Cable News Network the Gore campaign aired a 30second 
commercial within a half hour of the conclusion of the event 
The candidates exchanged barbs from the very beginning in a 
reflection of the struggle for survival that the New Hampshire 
primary has become They spent only a few moments at middebate 
criticizing the Reagan administration 
Hart and Babbitt continually chided the topthree in Iowa for 
failing to provide specific proposals Hart complaining that 
Dukakis didnt have an energy policy or a budget plan either 
Wheres the beef he asked in a reprise of the line that 
Walter F Mondale used effectively against him in the 1984 race 
You dont know anything about putting together a budget 
replied Dukakis who has served as governor of Massachusetts for 10 
years and has said that now is not the time to deliver a detailed 
federal spending plan 
And what is your energy policy Hart said I havent heard 
a Dukakis policy yet 
Thats because you havent been campaigning shot back 
Dukakis Gary wait a second if youd been around in the long 
hot summer and fall months youd have heard about my energy 
policy he said in a reference to Harts withdrawal from the race 
after questions were raised about his relationship with Miami model 
Donna Rice 
Babbitt supporter of a national sales tax to reduce the 
deficit taunted Dukakis saying Wheres your budget plan 
Simon locked in a battle for second place with Gephardt 
according to the polls was the first candidate to speak during the 
debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters 
He began with an attack on the Missouri congressman complaining 
that Gephardts support of President Reagans ax bills had led to 
the huge budget and trade deficits 
At one point Gephardt defended his own shift in positions on 
several issues noting that Simon had endorsed Republican Tom Dewey 
for president in 1948 and now you base your campaign on Harry 
Truman 
The 60minute debate was interrupted at the outset by a heckler 
who stood at his seat and began shouting When is the Democratic 
party going to do something about AIDS He was quickly hustled 
from the hall by security officials 
Where were we said Dukakis as the commotion died down 
Where they were was a Dukakis attack against Gephardts practice 
for taking PAC funds You cant beat up on the establishment and 
take their money said Dukakis 
Where are the PACs for the homeless where are the PACs for 
the working people who dont have health insurance he said 
Babbitt who finished fifth in Iowa and places the same in New 
Hampshire polls took a shot of his own at Gephardt for being a 
congressional insider but campaigning as an antiestablishment 
figure Thats not a flipflop thats a triple back somersault 
with a half twist he said 
The Democrats have been trading attacks and counterattacks in 
speeches and television ads this week as the battle moved into the 
final 72 hours 
The sharpest exchanges came between Gephardt and Simon 
concerning a new television ad attacking Gephardt for his votes on 
nuclear power the B1 bomber taxes and other matters Simon said 
the ad reveals inconsistencies in Gephardts record but the 
commercial infuriated Gephardt who demanded it be taken off the 
air 
Gephardts apology came when Gore asked him about comments made 
earlier in the week by campaign manager William Carrick disparaging 
Gephardt and his staff Gephardt first said that Carrick was sorry 
but Gore persisted and asked if he was too 
Of course Al of course Youre my friend 
The League debate is the latest in the long series of 
confrontations between the 1988 presidential hopefuls By one 
campaigns count it is the 19th such debate in 1987 and 1988
