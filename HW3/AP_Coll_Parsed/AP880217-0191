Alain Savary whose policies as education minister 
in 1984 caused street protests and a change in Socialist 
governments died Wednesday at age 69 
A Socialist Party statement said Savary had been hospitalized 
for several weeks with a serious infection but did not give the 
cause of death 
Savary proposed a bill in the National Assembly in 1984 to carry 
out President Francois Mitterrands campaign promises to revamp the 
system of private education 
Among its provisions the complex reform bill gave local 
authorities more control over management and finances of private 
schools It also gave teachers in those schools the option of 
retaining their status or choosing civil service status and linked 
state subsidies to the number of teachers who preferred the change 
Nearly 16 percent of Frances 12 million school children attend 
private schools of which 94 percent are Roman Catholic and heavily 
subsidized by the state 
The Savary Law inflamed passions for months Opponents felt it 
threatened their right to choose how their children would be 
educated Supporters wanted to hold Mitterrand to his promise to 
create a unified secular public education service 
More than 1 million people joined daylong demonstrations across 
France on June 24 1984 
Pierre Mauroy then premier said the reforms had been totally 
misunderstood but the Socialists withdrew the bill 
Jean Pierre Chevenment replaced Savary as education minister and 
Mauroy gave way as premier to Laurent Fabius 
Savary who was in the French Resistance during World War II 
had a reputation for being softspoken but stubborn 
He was a leader in the government formed just after liberation 
and a member of the National Assembly and held ministerial 
positions under President Charles de Gaulle and in other 
governments 
Born April 25 1918 in Algeria then a French colony he was a 
strong advocate of decolonization of Africa 
Lionel Jospin secretary of the Socialist Party said Wednesday 
He represented socialism with his strong sense of morality his 
sense of justice and his commitment to the decolonization
