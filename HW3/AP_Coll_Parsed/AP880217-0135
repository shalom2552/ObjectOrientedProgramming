George Bush and Michael Dukakis today 
pointed their campaigns southward after decisive New Hampshire 
victories and Bob Dole promised to counterattack unless the vice 
president stops distorting the Dole record Bush denied he had 
done anything wrong 
Richard Gephardt who finished second to Dukakis said he was in 
the race to stay However Sen Paul Simon of Illinois third among 
Democrats in New Hampshire after finishing second in Iowa said he 
will have to drop out unless he can win next week in either South 
Dakota or Minnesota Former Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt said he had 
a divided mind about whether to continue but that Jesse Jackson 
had already asked for his support if he should drop out 
Dole the big Republican winner in Iowa last week said Bushs 
comeback victory in New Hampshire was at least partly due to Bush 
TV commercials that Dole said distorted his record 
Im going to try to go out and straighten it out he said at 
the Manchester NH airport before flying back to Washington 
Im not going to run from it Im not known for running from a 
fight 
Bush who returned to Washington Tuesday night was reluctant to 
talk about Doles accusation However when questioned during a 
brief exchange with reporters today he replied I think I said 
it wasnt true but Ill be glad to say that 
You all want me to talk about Sen Dole I want to talk about 
the issues Bush said Im not going to dwell on it you see I 
dont want to be drawn into something like that 
Bush added People in New Hampshire like clean campaigns and 
they endorsed me overwhelmingly 
Tuesday night Dole had accused Bush of lying about my 
record 
Bush asked about that in an interview taped for CBSTV today 
said Im sorry he feels that way 
Were you lying Bush was asked 
No he answered quietly 
Bush won 38 percent of the Republican vote and 11 delegates to 
the GOP convention in complete returns Dole had 29 percent of 
the vote and seven delegates They were followed by Rep Jack Kemp 
of New York former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont and former 
television evangelist Pat Robertson 
Dukakis lived up to expectations by carrying his neighboring 
state by 16 percentage points over Rep Gephardt of Missouri last 
weeks winner in Iowa 
The turnout was a record 154012 Republican voters and 119041 
Democrats for a total of 273053 compared with 261243 in 1980 
This years figure was estimated to represent a bit less than half 
the states registered voters 
In other comments today 
Dukakis who won by a big margin in a state bordering 
Massachusetts where he is the governor said on ABCTV that he can 
also do well in the South which dominates the Super Tuesday 
primaries on March 8 People in the South arent voting for a ZIP 
code theyre voting for the president of the United States he 
said 
Simon said on NBCTV he would have to win next week 
otherwise Im going to have to withdraw You just cant 
continue to run second and third 
Gephardt said on ABC that whoever remains in the race he 
himself will do well because were connecting with the voters on 
my ideas 
Rep Jack Kemp of New York who beat out former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson and former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont for 
third place among the Republicans said his showing proved his 
standing among the conservatives who form the base for himself du 
Pont and Robertson 
Robertson on the other hand said This was a small spread 
between Jack and me He added New England is not my natural 
constituency Going into the South its a different ball 
game 
On to the South where were going to rise again exclaimed 
a euphoric Bush late Tuesday night He won a solid victory after 
seeing his earlier 20point lead in the polls melt in New Hampshire 
after his embarrassing thirdplace finish in Iowa behind Dole and 
Robertson 
For all the attention they got Granite State voters managed to 
keep the presidential races in both parties in turmoil offering 
just enough support to alsorans to give them an excuse to struggle 
on toward Super Tuesday with its enormous 20state risks and 
rewards 
Among the Republicans Kemp finished third with 13 percent and 
three delegates Du Pont edged out Robertson 10 percent to 9 
percent Du Ponts total was high enough to win two delegates 
Robertson got none 
In the delegate totals after Bushs 61 came Dole with 42 Kemp 
with 35 and du Pont with two The winning Republican needs 1139 
delegates 
Among the Democrats after Dukakis with 36 percent of the vote 
and nine delegates came Gephardt with 20 percent and six delegates 
and Simon with 17 percent and three delegates 
The other Democratic finishers Jackson with 8 percent Sen 
Albert Gore Jr 7 percent Babbitt 5 percent and Gary Hart 4 
percent didnt do well enough to pick up any delegates 
In the delegate totals after Dukakis 445 came Gephardt with 
39 and Simon with 33 The victorious Democrat needs 2082 delegates 
for the nomination 
Though he got no delegates Jackson said he was happy because 
in Iowa and New Hampshire we proved we could broaden our base 
Asked how he expected to do in the South he said I expect to 
win 
Bush was exultant at his showing Quoting Mark Twain he said 
Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated 
Dukakis belittled Gores regional strategy 
Tomorrow we head South said the Massachusetts governor 
I dont have a Southern strategy he said I dont have a 
Northern strategy or a Western strategy I have an American 
strategy 
Six states will vote before Super Tuesday but it was clear 
Tuesday night that the campaigns were looking ahead to March 8 when 
20 states on the Democratic side and 16 on the Republican will 
offer the biggest oneday delegate prize of the campaign 
Minnesota and South Dakota take the spotlight next Republicans 
and Democrats hold caucuses in Minnesota and primaries in South 
Dakota next Tuesday 
In the New Hampshire Democratic primary Gephardt and Simon 
fighting for Democratic runnerup were also in a battle for money 
Both campaigns are in financial trouble and needed a secondplace 
finish to keep contributions coming in 
With a first in Iowa and a second in New Hampshire Gephardt was 
able to claim Im in good shape 
South Carolinas Republican primary is Saturday March 5 three 
days before Super Tuesday 
Gore the Tennessee senator who passed up Iowa and spent less 
time than his rivals in New Hampshire watched the returns from 
Houston Texas where he said Super Tuesday changes all the 
rules Its a completely new ballgame
