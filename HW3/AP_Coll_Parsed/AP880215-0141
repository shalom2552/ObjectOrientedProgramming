Soviet generals said Monday the experience of the 
Afghan war will not keep the Soviet Union from supporting other 
proKremlin governments around the world 
The generals appeared at a news conference in Moscow to mark the 
70th anniversary of the Soviet armed forces 
They refused to say how many Soviet soldiers have been killed in 
Afghan fighting since December 1979 but Western observers have 
estimated Soviet dead may number about 10000 
Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev said a week ago Moscow wants 
to start withdrawing its soldiers from Afghanistan by May 15 if 
UNsponsored talks can reach a final agreement this spring 
Gorbachev said the estimated 115000 Soviet soldiers could be out 
of the country in 10 months 
Army Gen Yevgeny Ivanovsky said Monday the experiences of 
Afghanistan would provide tactical lessons for the Soviet military 
He said most Soviet casualties in Afghanistan came not in 
traditional combat but from mines in the roads shots from 
around the corner and surprise attacks 
Col Gen Dmitri Volkogonov deputy head of political 
administration of the armed forces said the Soviet military is 
drawing lessons from the stalemate with Afghan guerrillas But he 
added This does not put in doubt our readiness to provide moral 
diplomatic political and other forms of help to a friendly 
regime 
Asked if sending Soviet soldiers to Afghanistan was a mistake 
he said It was an act of assistance based on a request of a 
legitimate government Therefore it was not a mistake It was the 
fulfillment of our duty 
Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 oversaw 
the replacement of one proSoviet government with another and 
since then have been engaged in fighting the antiMarxist Islamic 
guerrillas 
The guerrillas are backed by the United States among others 
The Soviet Union and Afghanistan have said the Soviet soldiers 
cannot be withdrawn until military aid to the insurgents is cut off 
Gorbachev said the Soviets would make no demands about the 
composition of a future government putting the role of President 
Najibs proSoviet government in doubt 
Meanwhile Pakistans minister of state for foreign affairs 
Zain Noorani left his country for America on Monday for talks with 
Secretary of State George Shultz and other US officials on 
reaching an accord on the Afghan issue 
He said the recent shuttle by UN mediator Diego Cordovez 
between Pakistan and Afghanistan Gorbachevs announcement on 
Soviet troop withdrawal plans and a visit to Pakistan by Soviet 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov had brought the Afghan issue 
forward 
It was not clear if Nooranis departure for Washington was 
prompted by a sharpening of differences between the stands taken by 
Pakistan and the mujahedeen guerrillas 
The Pakistanis who represent the guerrillas in the 
UNsponsored Geneva talks with the Kabul government have agreed 
that some Communist figures could participate in a future interim 
government in Afghanistan 
The guerrillas have refused such a compromise and have insisted 
on an allmujahedeenrun government
