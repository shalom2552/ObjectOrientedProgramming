The Reagan administration says withdrawal of 
some warships in the Persian Gulf represents a finetuning of 
the US presence but it also is voicing concern over the conduct 
of Iraqi forces in the region 
There are currently 28 ships in the region but the helicopter 
carrier Okinawa the battleship Iowa and two escorts are coming 
home without being replaced assistant secretary of defense Richard 
Armitage said Tuesday 
Our mission of protecting US flag ships in the gulf remains 
unchanged Armitage said We dont think the overall threat 
has abated However we think weve learned a lot of lessons in the 
minesweeping area and this allows us primarily to pull out some 
of the ships 
Armitage said the Pentagon no longer thinks it needs 
minesweeping helicopters along with minesweeping ships clearing 
the way for the Okinawas departure 
Armitage in charge of international security affairs also said 
the United States already had protested to Baghdad an incident 
Saturday in which an Iraqi jet fired a missile near a US 
destroyer 
He said the administration planned to send a team of military 
officials to Iraq later this week to discuss the matter further 
Armitage also said that the administration had no plans to offer 
military protection to USowned ships flying foreign flags 
In Santa Barbara Calif White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater 
said This represents a finetuning of our position in the Gulf 
and not a policy change that would be reflected in overall forces 
or in other countries actions 
The remarks by Armitage were the first reflecting official 
administration concern about Iraqi military operations near US 
ships The United States thought it had won Iraqi agreement after 
the deadly attack on the USS Stark last May to keep jet fighters 
roughly 40 miles away from American warships 
In Saturdays incident an Iraqi jet failed to respond to Navy 
radio calls and fired a missile that passed close to the destroyer 
Chandler during a convoy operation 
Armitage announced other moves that had been previously outlined 
Jan 26 
The aircraft carrier Enterprise has just replaced the carrier 
Midway in the northern Arabian Sea making it easier to order the 
Iowa home The Enterprise is a much larger nuclearpowered carrier 
with a larger air wing than that aboard the Midway 
The command ship of the Middle East Force the LaSalle will 
soon be replaced in a routine rotation by the Coronado 
The amphibious landing ship Portland is being replaced by the 
amphibious landing ship Trenton which will be carrying Marine 
Cobra attack copters
