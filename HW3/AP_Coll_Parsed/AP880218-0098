In formulating this budget I have endeavored to meet national 
priorities while keeping to the terms of the Bipartisan Budget 
Agreement and the GRH Act 
In essence the agreement limits the 1988to1989 increase in 
domestic discretionary program budget authority to 2 percent 
To address urgent national priorities insofar as possible within 
this overall 2 percent limit my budget proposes that some programs 
such as those for education drug enforcement and technology 
development receive larger funding increases while others are 
reduced reformed or in some cases terminated 
Highpriority programs must be funded adequately 
One of our highest priorities is to foster individual success 
through greater education and training oppoortunities 
For example 
I propose an increase of 656 million over the 162 billion 
appropriated for 1988 for discretionary programs of the Department 
of Education Although state and local governments fund most 
educational activity federal programs provide crucial aid for the 
poor the handicapped and the educationally disadvantaged 
I have proposed reform of our overcentralized welfare system 
through state experimentation with innovative alternatives In 
addition my initiative would overhaul current employment and 
training programs for welfare recipients and strengthen our 
national child support enforcement system 
By emphasizing housing vouchers I would provide housing 
assistance to 135500 additional lowincome households in 1989 8 
percent more than the 125000 additional households receiving 
housing subsidies in 1988 
Ineffective programs to assist dislocated workers would be 
replaced by an expanded 1 billion worker readjustment program 
WRAP carefully designed to help those displaced from their jobs 
move quickly into new careers 
In addition I am proposing funds to strengthen US technology 
and make America more competitive 
For example 
I propose a continued increase in federally supported basic 
research aimed at longerterm improvements in the nations 
productivity and global competitiveness This budget would double 
National Science Foundation support for academic basic research 
increase support for training future scientists and engineers and 
expedite technology transfer of governmentfunded research to 
industry 
I would provide 115 billion for space programs including 
essential funding for continued development of Americas first 
permanently manned space station increased support for improving 
the performance and reliability of the space shuttle a major new 
initiative the Advanced Xray Astrophysics Facility for space 
science further support to encourage the commercial development of 
space and a new technology effort Project Pathfinder designed to 
develop technologies to support future decisions on the expansion 
of human presence and activity beyond Earths orbit into the solar 
system 
I also recommend 363 million in 1989 to initiate construction 
of the Superconducting Super Collider SSC including 283 million 
for construction and 60 million for supporting research and 
development The SSC as currently envisaged will be the largest 
pure science project ever undertaken It will help keep this 
country on the cutting edge of high energy physics research until 
well into the next century
