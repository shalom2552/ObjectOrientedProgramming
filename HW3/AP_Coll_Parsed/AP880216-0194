Its a still night on McClellan Street when a 
dozen cops guns drawn spill from a dark van and race up to a 
twostory brick house A 280pound narc aims an iron battering ram 
at the door 
Shouts break the silence Police officers Search warrant 
Running footsteps rumble inside 
The door is down in 35 seconds and police flood in Three 
minutes later six people are handcuffed The search for drugs 
begins with officers lifting ceiling panels rummaging in drawers 
shaking a Virgin Mary statue 
Its another night in Detroits war against crack another raid 
against potent chunks of cocaine that have snuffed out lives 
destroyed families clogged courts and jails and created an 
epidemic some say may be the worst in the nation

The McClellan raid police say netted three arrests two ounces 
of crack which fell out of one suspects pants leg and more than 
1000 in cash Scenes like this occur roundtheclock in Detroit 
Since Mayor Coleman Young announced a new assault on crack more 
than two months ago police average a dozen raids a day Hundreds 
have been arrested Hundreds of thousands of dollars in drugs have 
been seized 
I think its at a war stage us against them said City 
Councilman David Eberhard If we dont clean up the drugs 
theyll take over We cant turn the city over to the criminal 
element 
I think the community needs to know were doing something 
he added 
The highprofile raids are aimed to show just that The early 
focus has been on crack houses and smalltime operators to show 
citizens as much as traffickers that police mean business 
We attacked the visible part first to get public 
awareness said Commander Joel Gilliam who oversees the police 
departments narcotics unit He said larger traffickers will be 
targeted next 
Detroits crack problem is staggering According to police 
state and federal officials 
Up to 4000050000 people in Detroit and the surrounding area 
have a 50aday crack habit totaling more than 900 million a 
year 
On a given day about 1300 crack houses are operating in 
Detroit Thousands more dealers work street corners or other 
locations 
Cocainerelated emergency room visits to Detroit hospitals 
increased sevenfold from the last half of 1984 to the first half 
of 1987 In New York by comparison the increase in such visits 
was about 2 times 
The practice of trading sex for crack is believed largely 
responsible for Detroits huge increase in a penicillinresistant 
strain of gonorrhea from 15 cases in 1985 to 2344 last year 
Statistics however cannot capture the mindboggling brutality 
that pervades the lives of crack dealers and addicts 
Horror stories are endless a teenage woman involved in a crack 
dispute is branded 20 times with a heated potato masher then shot 
the gun barrel pressed against her forehead a baby dies of drug 
intoxication after nursing at her cocaineusing mothers breast 
crack users sell their food stamps beds even protective bars on 
their windows for another piece of the precious rock 
Youll sell your mama youll sell your daddy Gilliam said 
Youll steal youll break into cars youll prostitute Its 
called the glass pimp You wont eat You wont sleep Thats how 
addicting it is 
Many cities including New York Dallas and Los Angeles have 
crack problems But William Coonce special agentincharge of the 
local Drug Enforcement Administration office believes Detroit may 
be the worst 
He attributes the problem to an explosive combination hard 
economic times access to guns 5000 to 10000 abandoned 
buildings lack of opportunities for teenagers and a per capita 
murder rate that in 1985 and 86 was the worst in the nation In 
1987 there were 645 homicides three fewer than the year before 
police said 
Gilliam estimates 6065 percent of Detroits killings are 
drugrelated 
Some people have become frustrated Two men recently admitted 
setting fires last fall at an alleged crack house in an attempt to 
drive dealers from their neighborhood Theyve been charged with 
arson 
One of the two said the community supported them and noted it 
was like a neighborhood project 
Other people are simply frightened 
The neighbors are scared to death Theyre all running for 
cover Coonce said Very definitely its out of hand 
Violence and crack feed on one other Crack a blend of cocaine 
and baking soda boiled and dried and broken into rocks can take 
effect in 10 seconds It can create a false sense of confidence 
making users do crazy things 
One man stabbed two relatives dozens of times then took money 
from one of the victims and spent it on crack police said 
You sniff cocaine and you rise to the top of the mountain 
Gilliam said You smoke crack you shoot to the top Youve 
got to pull them off the ceilings to lock them up 
Crack is popular in the inner city because rocks cost as little 
as 5 or 10 And while Detroit is the main marketplace trade has 
expanded into the suburbs 
Sheriff Ficano said his narcotics unit seized 2 million in cash 
last year double that of 1986 Authorities also estimate up to 50 
percent of crack customers in Detroit are suburbanites
