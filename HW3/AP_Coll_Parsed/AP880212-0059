The Environmental Protection Agency said 
Friday it had begun a special review of the insecticide dichlorvos 
which is used in flykilling pest strips and many other 
applications 
The agency said studies on laboratory animals show the chemical 
may cause cancer and liver damage 
Some 2 million pounds of dichlorvos are used in about 800 
products every year About 25 percent is used on farm crops 35 
percent on livestock 25 percent in commercial and industrial 
buildings and on lawns and ornamental crops and 15 percent in 
homes and on pets EPA said 
Dichlorvos has been used since 1948 against flies mosquitoes 
gnats cockroaches and other insects 
Last Septmeber the agency ordered new label warnings and 
restrictions on commercial use of most products to statecertified 
applicators but did not restrict home and pet products Workers 
are supposed to keep out of commercial and agricultural areas for 
48 hours after treatment 
EPAs special reviews can lead to fewer or more restrictions a 
ban on the product or its exoneration The agency tries to complete 
the reviews in 12 months to 15 months
