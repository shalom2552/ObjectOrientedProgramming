We others in my generation went under in the machinery of war 
in fear and in the effort to survive In the dreadful run of a war 
only one thing is certain death knows no fronts I say that 
because at the end of a war there are always the wounds the 
widows and the families without fathers Above all let us never 
forget that the systematic and perfected destruction of European 
Jews by the NS Nazi regime was added to the horrors of this war 
It must be a holy duty for us to do everything so that the crimes 
of this time are never repeated again 
The war years were a bitter period of learning which I have not 
spoken much about and did not want to speak much about Perhaps 
that was a mistake but it was certainly not a strategy of covering 
up We were all happy then when the war was over and tried 
together to build a better and more humane world 
I drew one lesson from this time I wanted to help assure that 
there would never be war again I wanted to work for peace I was 
able to do this as an ambassador and foreign minister of Austria 
and as secretarygeneral of the United Nations for 10 years 
My fellow citizens You can measure on the basis of my life 
since 1945 whether or not I have overcome the bitter 
apprenticeship of the war 
You can judge for yourselves whether your president is the young 
lieutenant or even the distorted picture of this officer of the 
Wehrmacht or whether your president is a man who for decades of 
his life worked for justice tolerance and peace I ask you to 
form your own judgment 
My Austrians In the course of the new discussion the question 
was also put about my premature departure from this office of 
federal president I want to take a stand in all clarity You my 
dear Austrians have elected me federal president with a convincing 
majority in a secret and direct election for six years Thus it is 
no longer a matter of the man Kurt Waldheim In view of the 
slanders I have often asked myself in the last two years whether 
I should carry on all that 
It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that an election 
result cannot be subsequently corrected It is however also a 
question of justice and fairness toward the person as well as the 
respect for the highest office in the state A head of state must 
not retreat in the face of slanders hateful demonstrations and 
wholesale condemnations We certainly dont want such methods to be 
used against other democratic institutions in other situations Let 
us not endager the selfrespect and selfconsciousness of our 
state It is a question of belief in our fatherland 
I see my duty as president in ensuring the functioning of the 
basic principles and the institutions of our republic It cannot 
serve this duty if the president retreats in the face of outside 
pressure and so puts into question the meaning of democratic 
decisions Such a step could become the beginning of a development 
which would bring new and much more serious difficulties Since the 
beginning of my term in office I bound myself to the thought of 
reconciliation and cooperation and continue to profess these 
principles very deeply despite all the intolerance of my 
opponents 
At the same time I would like to make clear that I will 
decisively confront things I cannot be expected to bear There must 
be no doubt about one thing only if the polemics stop in Austria 
itself can we expect the debate abroad to calm down Therefore I 
appeal to all Austrians in particular to all politically 
responsible leaders in our homeland not to pour oil onto the fire 
and to put the interests of the state before party political 
interests The consciousness of the state must always be stronger 
than that which may divide us 
My dear countrymen you can trust me as you trusted two years 
ago when you elected me as federal president Those people who 
spread intolerance and discord cannot be allowed to prevail but 
rather the great majority of those for whom it is a question of our 
homeland of our common Austria If we want this we will do it 
together and can form the future with new strength
