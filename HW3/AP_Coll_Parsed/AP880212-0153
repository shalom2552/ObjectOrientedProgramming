Its the ultimate Valentines Day challenge for 
lingerie retailers Can you top this bottom 
From rhinestonestudded undies to briefs fitted with music boxes 
to a club that delivers perfumed giftwrapped panties the 
lingerie industry is shedding its cottondrawer image and 
exploiting the holiday of the heart 
Some insiders say that for this special subcategory of womens 
clothing retailers Valentines Day is second only to Christmas 
when it comes to racking up holiday sales Their most compelling 
sales pitch is that no matter how scanty lingerie lasts longer 
than roses and isnt fattening like chocolates 
Lila Williams thinks her PantyoftheMonth Club covers the 
territory when it comes to imaginative love tokens This 
Brooklynbased entrepreneur promises to put one pair of scented 
giftwrapped designer briefs in the mailbox for 1650 each month 
Men are the main purchasers of her hidden couture she 
estimates 95 percent of the subscriptions to her panty club have 
been bought by men 
With more than 1000 customers Williams makes sure the package 
and panty are colorcoded to the season Last years April 
Easter pair had a furry detachable bunny tail the July 
firework special was of course red white and blue and New 
Years pair was silver silk 
Williams said she handdyed 600 pieces of lingerie to a minty 
green for last St Patricks Day her thirdbiggest sales period 
This year however she found emerald satin panties trimmed with 
champagne lace And dont forget the optional Erin Go Bra bra 
But Fredericks of Hollywoods 10 pair of musical panties is a 
tough contender 
Cleverly hidden amid what little redandwhite lace makes up 
this undergarment which a company spokeswoman described as very 
small is a tiny computer box that can chirp out a rendition of 
Let Me Call You Sweetheart at the pull of a string 
Though long considered outside the realm of highclass lingerie 
Fredericks has managed to spawn 150 stores nationwide and post 
annual sales in the 58 million range spokeswoman Ellen Appel said 
For those who want to be a bit more extravagant Bloomingdales 
in New York is selling rhinestonestudded red silk panties for 100 
a pair The matching camisole carries a 250 price tag 
The idea of sleaziness is leaving the American scene said 
Carol Palmer an analyst with Duff amp Phelps Inc in Chicago Just 
look at how the square footage for lingerie in department stores is 
increasing 
Indeed the last few years have seen a coming out of lingerie 
as a real fashion item said Kurt Barnard a retail marketing 
consultant and publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing Report 
Over a year ago for example Bloomingdales flagship Manhattan 
store moved its lingerie department from the more pedestrian ground 
floor to upstairs next to designer clothing a spokeswoman said 
The industry is growing rather fast Barnard said pointing 
to The Limited Inc as one major retailer that has focused on 
lingerie with its 237store Victorias Secret chain 
Its likely well see more and more stores affiliated with 
lingerie spinoffs Barnard predicted 
The actual size of the industry is difficult to gauge partly 
because many of the players are private companies and because the 
industry does not have a trade association 
But Ray McInerney publisher of Intimate Fashion News said his 
publication reported 1986 intimate apparel sales totaled 56 
billion 
While trailing sleepwear which posted 1986 sales of 142 
billion and bras which totaled 134 billion sales of panties 
reached 11 billion and ranked ahead of robes slips and girdles 
Williams finds panties the most essential item She notes they 
come in the most colors and styles theyre the least expensive 
and most needed piece of intimate apparel 
This year has spurred a major growth in pants said Lisa 
Goldstein fashion editor for intimate apparel at Womens Wear 
Daily She says theres a silhouette to fit any figure from 
bikinis to petits pants 
Even the Gstring and its minisculely more generous sister the 
thong panty continue to rack up sales I thought they would 
be a flash in the pan but Christian Dior and Lily of France are 
doing a very big business in them she said
