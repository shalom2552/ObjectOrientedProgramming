American labor leaders are breaking a 
fourdecade tradition of unqualified support for Israel condemning 
its use of unneccessary force against Palestinians on the West 
Bank and in Gaza 
The 143millionmember labor federations executive council 
approved the firstever rebuke of Israel Tuesday after meeting with 
Secretary of State George Shultz who is scheduled to begin a tour 
of the Middle East next week 
The AFLCIOs winter meeting was Shultz last stop of an 
extended weekend in southern Florida to gain support from 
traditional friends of Israel for his effort to soften Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamirs opposition to entering new peace 
negotiations 
Shultz is seeking to promote a resumption of negotiations on 
Palestinian selfrule in the Israelioccupied territories 
Shultz addressed a meeting of the BNai Brith AntiDefamation 
League in Palm Beach last Friday seeking help from US Jewish 
leaders in pressing Shamir to show more flexibility 
Theres been so much emphasis on the process direct 
negotiations on the one hand an international conference or some 
kind of international vehicle on the other that the discussion 
has become a little sterile he told reporters Tuesday If we 
are going to get going we need to talk a little bit more about the 
substance of what might happen 
Shamir has opposed a resumption of negotiations if they are 
based on a premise that Israel will have to give up state control 
of some of the occupied territories as a condition for peace 
Shultz said the United States is not trying to stake out a 
position of one kind or another on that issue However he said 
getting to the substance in terms of things that would be 
talked about when people address ultimate resolutions of the 
ArabIsraeli conflict is needed to get the negotiations going 
again 
The AFLCIO while blaming Islamic fundamentalists for fueling 
the flames of violence in the occupied territories said the 
Palestinian demonstrations did not warrant the unnecessary 
force used by Israeli defense forces on occasion 
No doubt such incidents can be attributed to the inexperience 
of the Israeli army in riot control and other police functions and 
to the frustrations of Israeli soldiers as they confront young 
Palestinians hurling stones and petrol bombs the federation 
said These factors may explain but they cannot excuse and the 
AFLCIO cannot condone the use of excessive force against 
civilians 
The federation however rejected what it called a notion that 
Israel must now redeem itself by turning the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip over to the Palestine Liberation Organization
