Bond prices sagged Friday as hopes faded for 
continued declines in interest rates and concerns grew about 
inflation 
The activity occurred against a backdrop of new government 
reports that included a smallerthanexpected December trade 
deficit and a rise in wholesale prices in January

or 875 for every 1000 in face value It rose more than 10 
shortly after the trade report was released before quickly 
reversing course 
Its yield climbed to 843 percent from 835 percent late 
Thursday 
The government reported the US trade imbalance fell to 122 
billion in December from 132 billion in November 
The report sent bond prices higher because the deficit was lower 
than many analysts had expected and indicated the gap could shrink 
without new declines in the dollar A falling dollar discourages 
foreign investors such as the Japanese from buying US securities 
But the rise was shortlived as bond prices abruptly changed 
direction 
Analysts said the reversal occurred because the markets 
attention shifted from the trade report to a second government 
report that wholesale prices rose 04 percent in January after a 
04 percent decline in December 
Paul Boltz chief financial economist for T Rowe Price 
Associates a Baltimorebased investment company said the 
wholesale price numbers triggered some concerns about inflation 
which would erode the value of bonds 
At midday the Federal Reserve took steps for the second day in 
a row to arrange securities sales that had the effect of draining 
reserves from the banking system 
Some analysts said that signaled the central bank had no 
intention of further relaxing its credit policy and that it raised 
questions about whether it had eased its policy earlier this week 
as some economists believed it had 
The federal funds rate the closelywatched interest charge on 
shortterm loans between banks edged up to 6 1116 percent from 6 
percent late Thursday 
The rate is often seen as an indication of which way the Fed 
wants shortterm rates to go and when it fell below 6 percent 
earlier this week some economists concluded that the Fed had 
relaxed its credit policy 
The market had gotten overexuberant on the possibility of 
further Fed easing but after the Fed drained reserves the 
funds rate kicked up The prospect of Fed easing is up in the 
air said Elliott Platt research director for the investment 
firm Donaldson Lufkin amp Jenrette Securities Inc 
Late Friday afternoon the Fed disclosed its policymakers 
decided in December to end aggressive efforts to push interest 
rates lower believing that the immediate threat from the October 
stock market collapse had passed 
Fed policymakers met again Tuesday and Wednesday but did not 
disclose any results of their actions
