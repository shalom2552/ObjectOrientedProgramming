Hundreds of motorists were stranded by 
blowing and drifting snow today in southwestern Minnesota filling 
motels and National Guard armories 
Elsewhere in the state however the wind had died down after 
closing major highways 
The winds are going down but were at a standstill yet 
said Lorren Simon a dispatcher for the State Patrol in Marshall 
Interstate 90 from the South Dakota border to 10 miles east of 
Jackson a stretch of about 120 miles was still closed this 
morning Simon said It was closed at 11 am Sunday 
Simon said authorities were worried some motorists might still 
be stranded in their cars 
Finding stranded travelers is a frustrating process he 
said You cant use strong enough language on them Theyll go 
out anyway and then they think the public officials should come out 
and rescue them when you cant go up and down the road They get 
real perturbed when someone doesnt go out there But Im sure 
there are going to be people out there in those cars 
Authorities said the nearzero visibility in the blowing snow 
along with high drifts made it impossible for rescue vehicles to 
go out 
All the roads are blocked said a Redwood Falls police 
dispatcher Nobody can leave town and I dont think anybody 
can get into town 
There were numerous traffic accidents many of them with 
injuries but no fatalities were reported 
More than 300 people sought shelter overnight in National Guard 
armories in Worthington Redwood Falls and Jackso said Lt Col 
Dave Pearson Food was provided by the National Guard and members 
of the community 1st Sgt Ron Balster said 
We lost count at about 212 said Balster Travelers signed 
in from Iowa Minnesota South Dakota Tennessee Kansas and 
Chicago 
We got 200 furniture blankets from UHaul Balster said We 
got paper towels from Campbell Soup And people have brought in all 
kinds of food There are sandwiches chicken One person just 
brought in two gallons of milk 
By 2 pm Sunday the Worthington Best Western motel was 
directing travelers to the armory Just about all the motels were 
filled up by 3 pm said Clayton Johnson at the Best Western 
We had 12 cars up here at one time fighting to get in the door 
for one room said Lucille Thorn manager of the Oxford Motel 
Worthington Holiday Inn general manager Connie Bruns said 75 to 
100 people spent the night in the lobby and meeting rooms 
In southeastern Minnesota conditions were much improved today 
with wind still gusting up to 35 mph but with little snow 
Theres some drifting on ramps and on side roads but it 
shouldnt be too bad said Bill Henke a dispatcher for the State 
Patrol in Rochester 
Conditions also improved in northwestern Minnesota and Minnesota 
2 was reopened at Crookston Interstate 94 and Minnesota 210 at 
Fergus Falls reopened Sunday night said Dayle Peterson a 
supervisor with the State Patrol in Detroit Lakes
