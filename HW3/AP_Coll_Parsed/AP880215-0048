Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to 
Washington on Wednesday for talks with US officials that are 
expected to focus on differences between the two countries on 
several key security issues 
During the threeday visit Kohl is slated to meet with 
President Reagan Secretary of State George P Shultz and leading 
members of Congress 
Kohl is expected to urge swift Senate ratification of the 
superpower agreement eliminating landbased intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles 
Differences between the two nations center on modernizing NATOs 
shortrange nuclear weapons and eliminating chemical weapons 
US officials and other NATO countries have emphasized the need 
for modernizing shortrange nuclear missiles that will remain in 
Europe after intermediaterange nuclear missiles are scrapped 
But West German officials have said that upgrading of 
shortrange weapons systems should be linked to negotiations on 
reducing the Warsaw Pacts superiority in conventional weapons in 
Central Europe 
Shortrange or battlefield nuclear weapons are primarily aimed 
at targets on West German and East German territory 
Kohl recently warned US military planners against strategies 
that would limit a nuclear war to German soil 
A strategy aimed at limiting the deterrent of nuclear weapons 
to Europe or worse to German soil is not acceptable to us he 
told a meeting of military experts Feb 6 
Kohl has urged that a higher priority be given to reducing the 
number of shortrange missiles which have a range of less than 300 
miles 
The superpowers however have indicated that future arms 
control talks will first concentrate on reducing strategic or 
longrange nuclear weapons arsenals 
West German government sources said Sunday that the main 
sticking point in Kohls talks with US officials could be the 
issue of chemical weapons 
Kohl and Foreign Minister HansDietrich Genscher who will 
accompany the chancellor are expected to press Reagan anew to work 
toward a superpower agreement for the worldwide destruction of 
chemical weapons 
US officials have said in recent months that such an agreement 
may be difficult to reach because of problems of verification 
West German leaders reject that argument saying the 
intermediaterange missile accord proves such problems can be 
worked out 
Kohl may also seek assurances that Washington will make good on 
a pledge not to deploy a new generation of binary chemical weapons 
in West Germany government sources said 
Under an agreement reached between Kohl and Reagan during the 
economic summit in Tokyo in 1986 aging chemical weapons now 
stationed in West Germany would not be replaced 
Instead the old weapons would be removed from West Germany and 
the new systems held in readiness in the United States 
There are indications however that the agreement may not be as 
firm as West German officials had hoped 
The news magazine Der Spiegel in its latest edition quoted 
US Geneva arms negotiator Max Friedersdorf as saying the 
agreement might not extend beyond Reagans term in office 
US Gen John Galvin NATOs chief commander in Europe told a 
West German newspaper on Saturday that he favored stationing the 
new weapons in Europe where the troops are
