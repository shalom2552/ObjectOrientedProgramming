Floridas first milliondollar lottery 
winner has already changed his telephone number because people keep 
calling to suggest ways of sharing or investing his fortune 
Thomas Sawyers hands were still shaking after winning the grand 
prize Saturday when a woman in the crowd handed him a pamphlet for 
a charity and walked away without saying a word 
That was just the beginning of the hassles of being a new 
millionaire Sawyer said 
Actually he isnt quite a millionaire His aftertax winnings 
of 800000 were transferred into his bank account Tuesday 
Sawyers win was the more astounding because he never bought a 
ticket something he says hell never do because hes opposed to 
all lotteries 
Instead he found a ticket that had been discarded in front of 
his store and sent it in to the milliondollar drawing which 
included about 460000 other entries 
Proceeds from the lottery are earmarked for education and on 
Wednesday Floridas assistant commissioner of education received a 
check for 462 million representing the first installment The 
game has generated sales of about 300 million 1 tickets in five 
weeks 
Its a redletter day for us said Lottery Secretary Rebecca 
Paul Were extremely proud and pleased 
The money will be used to pay for such items as student 
financial aid dropout prevention programs equipment library 
books and training programs for February and March 
Lt Gov Bobby Brantley who presented the check to Laurey 
Stryker assistant commissioner of education said he wanted to 
emphasize that the lottery wont generate enough money to take care 
of all education needs and that Gov Bob Martinez wants the 
proceeds to be used for onetime expenses to enhance education 
rather than for operating costs 
Since the drawing Sawyer said his telephone hasnt stopped 
ringing 
Ive got a few calls from charities he said But theyre 
not as big a hassle as the various investment companies 
Everybody says they want to help 
Sawyer said he had his telephone number changed Monday to an 
unlisted number But that didnt stop aggressive fortuneseekers 
who somehow learned his new number 
At home his wife and daughters screen the calls Several 
employees do the same at his St Petersburg paint store 
There are undoubtedly a million charities worth giving to 
Sawyer said I dont question that Everyone cant support 
everything Even the government cant do that and theyve got a 
lot more money than I do 
Sawyer already has pledged 10 percent of the money to his church 
and does not know whether he will give any of the remaining money 
away 
Sawyer said he will take advice from the accountant who has 
handled his business finances for the last several years There 
will be no special consultants or highpriced investment firms he 
said
