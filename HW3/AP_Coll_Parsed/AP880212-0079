Three Calvin College science 
professors who taught evolution instead of the biblical version of 
creation were sharply criticized in a report released Friday by 
trustees of the private college 
But the report which followed a yearlong investigation by a 
study committee called for no sanctions against the professors and 
concluded that their teachings fell within guidelines set by the 
Christian Reformed Church for interpretation of the Bible 
The report was very critical in a studied careful pastoral 
way of the professors writings and teachings said the Rev 
Charles De Ridder chairman of the board 
It was supportive of the professors concern for exploring 
theories other than creationism but De Ridder said the panel 
reminds the professors of the limitations that the guidelines 
place upon the interpretation of the Bible 
The board said those guidelines allow the teachings of such 
theories as evolution but that they ought to be evaluated in 
terms of the Christian faith said Gordon Van Harn provost of 
the college 
The study committee was formed in response to dozens of critical 
letters about the professors from students faculty church members 
and others De Ridder said 
The professors Clarence Menninga and Davis Young of the geology 
department and Howard Van Till of the physics department who have 
a combined 52 years at Calvin did not attend the boards news 
conference 
However Van Till said in a statement that he respected the 
board for recognizing the need for academic freedom and that 
the report contains both criticism and praise and speaks of both 
caution and encouragement 
The committee urges me to refine my interpretative methods in 
such a way that neither the event character nor the revelational 
meaning of biblical history will be called into question he said 
The professors describe themselves as loyal longtime members of 
the 300000member Grand Rapidsbased Christian Reformed Church 
which owns Calvin
