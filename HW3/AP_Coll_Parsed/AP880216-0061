A teacher a scientist and a linguist 
are adrift at sea with only enough food and water for one to 
survive before their raft reaches an island inhabited by a 
primitive civilization 
Who should be allowed to survive to enlighten the natives 
The question of which field of learning is most important may be 
as sticky as the one involving the chicken and the egg but three 
professors took it on during a raft debate at the University of 
Tennessee at Chattanooga 
Thomas G Waddell a chemistry professor opened the debate last 
Thursday by noting that he knew how to make aspirin antibiotics 
and synthetic fabrics 
If Im saved we can wear something besides animal skins he 
said Faulkner should not be read nor classes taught while 
dressed in animal skins 
But Eugene Bartoo the schools head of curriculum and 
instruction countered the notion of better living through 
chemistry 
Im sure the island is looking forward to polyester leisure 
suits one of the special contributions of chemistry to our 
lives he said before arguing that his ability to train others 
to teach made his specialty the most valuable 
Reed Sanderlin an English professor and language specialist 
argued that without a means to translate thoughts into written 
words the islands residents would have difficulty teaching others 
or assimilating technology 
Mr Waddell can work magic but what happens when he dies 
Sanderlin asked Mr Bartoo can lead these children along the 
beach and show them the possibilities of curriculum reform But 
what happens after that 
All of these things are important Sanderlin said The 
trouble is that at some points in history you cant have them all 
at the same time and you must make choices
