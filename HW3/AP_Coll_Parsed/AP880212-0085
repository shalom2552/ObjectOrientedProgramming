A group of 30 prominent intellectuals 
appealed to communist authorities to respect the right of free 
association but the staterun PAP news agency called their 
petition unnecessary 
In a commentary on its Englishlanguage service released late 
Thursday PAP said the appeals postulates seem to be somewhat 
belated like trying to pry open doors which are already open 
It said the signers do not take notice of very important 
changes which have occurred and continue to occur in Polands 
sociopolitical life including a relaxation of censorship to 
allow public debates on practically all internal problems 
In December the Polish United Workers Communist Party 
approved a package of political reforms that includes a pledge to 
ease curbs on forming independent associations 
However a new law on associations has not been passed yet and 
authorities have blocked efforts to form some independent groups 
such as the Economic Society a lobbying group favoring private 
enterprise 
The intellectuals petition was submitted to Parliament on Feb 
1 and was made public this week 
The appeal said it is impossible to start overcoming 
Polands crisis without real and not only declarative respect 
for the citizens right to free association It said every 
citizen should have the right to demand changes in the law without 
being punished for doing so 
The signers included 11 full members of the prestigious Polish 
Academy of Science Warsaw University rector Grzegorz Bialkowski 
former Solidarity economic adviser Ryszard Bugaj and the Economic 
Societys chairman Aleksander Paszynski
