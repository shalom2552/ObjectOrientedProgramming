Round Springs Road isnt what most people 
would call a road Its a path that winds around the bluff and dips 
twice into Round Springs before it reaches the Western Handle Co 
Thats twice suppliers buyers and the occasional visitor have 
to drive through the shallow creek to get to the company located 
just outside Tia Juana a small northeastern Oklahoma community 
east of Disney 
There are a few electric saws and automated lathes and sanders 
at the wooden handle mill to hint that the Industrial Revolution 
once visited And a home computer used in the office is proof the 
Computer Age stopped by 
Of course making wooden handles for tools and farm implements 
is a business that hasnt changed much since Ed Willhite started 
the company in 1934 The only difference now is how fast a handle 
can be made with the help of machines he said 
Willhite made some of the electric equipment used in the mill 
and other machinery was bought through the years as the company 
expanded 
This is just a baby company compared to some of the others 
Willhite said 
But coowner Bob Bradley who bought the company from the 
Willhites in 1981 is proud of this mill the only company of its 
kind in Oklahoma 
We dont try to compete with the others We just make our 
product and do what we can Bradley said 
The 90yearold Willhite has been retired since 1961 He turned 
the business over to his two oldest sons who ran it for more than 
20 years before selling it to Bradley and Joe Myers The two had 20 
years with the company between them when they took it over 
Bradley said business is fair at the mill with 15 employees 
working on the threeacre operation producing an average of 5000 
handles a day that range from a 10inch machinist handle to a 
60inch pitch fork handle 
But business isnt as good as it was in 1975 when Bradley joined 
a 35man crew that produced as much as 10000 handles a day He 
blames that on a depressed state economy that has forced most 
businesses to cut back 
The mill now operates on a temporary threeday work week in the 
slow winter season but it wont be long before business picks back 
up and the company is flooded with orders Bradley said 
Right now were trying to stockpile our supply so we can meet 
the demand in the spring when it comes he said 
Bradley said the company sells to lumber yards hardware stores 
and other handle companies State prisons also buy from the mill 
for their farming projects 
Willhite said he thinks the mill has manufactured and sold 
enough handles over the years to make a rick 8foot high from 
here to Tulsa a stretch of some 60 miles 
Willhite started the company in 1934 with a shave horse and a 
knife making about a dozen handles a day In 1942 they moved 
west to the remote wooded area its nestled in now 
We couldnt get any good white hickory out of Arkansas he 
said 
These days the Western Handle Co gets an ample supply of 
hickory ash and red and white oak from Tennessee and some from 
Ohio Willhite said 
Myers said the Western Handle Co really still is in the 
Willhite family because hes married to Willhites granddaughter 
and calls him grandpa And many of the employees are related or 
have the Willhite name he said 
Youre the one who started this thing Myers told Willhite 
Sometimes weve got to get him in here to straighten things out 
I may have started it but I cant take all the credit 
Willhite said Im not the one who finished it
