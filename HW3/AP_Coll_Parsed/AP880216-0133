Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H Humphrey III son of the 
late vice president announced Thursday he will seek the Democratic 
nomination for the US Senate seat now held by Republican David 
Durenberger 
Former Vice President Walter Mondale who served with Humphreys 
father in the Senate looked on in the Capitol Rotunda as the 
45yearold attorney general launched his campaign with an attack 
on Durenbergers priorities 
Meanwhile in Florida US Rep Dan Mica said he will challenge 
popular former Gov Reubin Askew in seeking the Democratic 
nomination to replace threeterm Sen Lawton Chiles who is 
retiring 
Humphrey who has led Minnesotas top law office for six years 
and served in the state Senate for 10 years before that said he is 
campaigning on his own record not that of his father who died in 
1978 and was briefly succeeded by his widow Muriel 
My fathers accomplishments with my mothers help are 
unparalleled in this century Humphrey said 
Humphrey said he could never take his fathers place 
But I know I can take Mr Durenbergers he said 
He charged Durenberger elected in 1982 had failed his 
constituents 
His priorities have been Star Wars Contra aid Judge Robert 
Bork cutting Social Security slashing Medicare and turning his 
back on the deficit said Humphrey 
Leon Oistad Durenbergers campaign manager said Humphreys 
announcement speech was riddled with distortions about 
Durenbergers record 
Humphrey faces an uphill battle in his bid to unseat 
Durenberger lagging behind the incumbent in both fundraising and 
the polls The latest poll conducted last month by the St Paul 
Pioneer Press Dispatch WCCOTV and WCCO Radio showed Durenberger 
leading Humphrey by 51 percent to 38 percent 
Oistad said Durenberger has not decided when he will officially 
enter the race 
The only other announced candidate is Polly Mann 67 a 
cofounder of Women Against Military Madness running as an 
independent 
Mica a 44yearold former school teacher and fifthterm 
congressman dismissed sentiment among some Democrats that there 
should be no challenge to Askew in the race for the Florida Senate 
seat 
If youve read the papers it looks like a handful of 
political kingmakers are trying to say Well select the 
candidate only one person should run he said 
Ive got news for them There are 12 million people in this 
state who will have a voice 
Mica has had a high profile in Congress in foreign policy and as 
chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations which last year 
took him to Moscow to look into concerns about security at the US 
Embassy 
He has been a supporter of President Reagans Central America 
policy but this month voted against the Contra aid package saying 
the peace process should be given some time 
Initial statewide polls have indicated he runs 6to1 behind 
Askew Mica says he can catch up by midsummer 
On the Republican side US Rep Connie Mack III is the only 
declared candidate 
On Monday Pennsylvania Republican Sen John Heinz III announced 
he will seek a third term 
Heinz 49 kicked off his campaign with a twoday series of 
stops Former Philadelphia city controller Joseph Vignola filed 
petitions to enter the April 26 primary for the Democratic 
nomination to oppose Heinz greatgrandson of the founder of the 
food maker HJ Heinz Co
