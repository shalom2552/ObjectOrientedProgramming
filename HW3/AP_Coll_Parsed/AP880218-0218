A man who had confessed a role 
in the slaying of the countrys most prominent human rights 
activist recanted Thursday and said he had been drugged and abused 
in jail 
Jorge Miranda 19 retracted his confession in a writ filed by 
his lawyers in the San Salvador court where the case is being 
heard He had said last month that he was a leftist guerrilla and 
was a lookout in the killing 
The document handwritten and signed by Miranda asks the judge 
to set a date for a new declaration that will negate the 
confession Mirandas lawyers made a copy of the document avaialble 
to The Associated Press 
Justice Minister Julio Samayoa presented Miranda to reporters on 
Jan 5 to reinforce the governments contention that leftist 
insurgents killed Herbert Anaya last Oct 26 Anaya was president 
of the independent Salvadoran Human Rights Commission 
Human rights organizations and San Salvadors Roman Catholic 
archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas had blamed the slaying on a death 
squad The rightist squads reportedly linked to security forces 
have been responsible for thousands of political killings since 
civil war broke out in 1979 
Rightists contend the rights commission headed by Anaya was a 
front organization for the guerrillas Three members of the 
commission have been killed in recent years and two disappeared 
Death squads claimed responsibility for two of the slayings 
Miranda last month told journalists he served as a lookout for 
the assassins who shot Anaya He said he was a member of the 
Peoples Revolutionary Army one of five guerrilla groups in the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
The government contends the rebels killed Anaya to create a 
martyr for their movement 
Miranda who is the capitals Mariona jail said in his writ 
I took responsibility in that death of Anaya because I felt 
very bad and worn out because of the treatment I was given by the 
National Police 
I felt worn out since a doctor arrived and while I was 
blindfolded gave me an injection this and other acts against 
me and my family pressured me to take responsibility for things I 
did not do 
There was no indication as to when Mirandas new declaration 
would be taken by the presiding judge
