George Bush and Jack Kemp sitting pretty just 
10 days ago as New Hampshire voters finally turned their attention 
to presidential politics are suddenly facing feast or famine in 
the states snowpacked primary And they arent alone 
For Pete du Pont Bruce Babbitt Gary Hart and maybe even Paul 
Simon Tuesdays elections shape up as a doordie test of their 
ability to stay alive in the 1988 presidential campaign 
New Hampshire has within its grasp the power of life or death 
over my candidacy said Babbitt who fashions himself the last 
honest man among the dirty dozen who have outlasted Alexander Haig 
on the campaign trail 
The tension is highest among the Republicans where the Reagan 
revolution may ride on the coattails of Bush and Kemp in their race 
against Bob Dole Pat Robertson and Pete du Pont 
For just as surely as 12yearold Robyn Perry carried the torch 
to begin the XV Winter Olympics Bush and Kemp carry the torch for 
the silent retiring fellow wholl be sitting by the fire in Santa 
Barbara 
Vice President Bush who held a huge lead in the New Hampshire 
polls until he lost Iowa in such embarrassing fashion wrapped 
himself in the presidency throughout Sunday nights debate At one 
point he went so far as to defend the State Department the State 
Department to punctuate the extent to which he hopes voters will 
put their trust in Reaganism 
Bush must win that is come in first Tuesday or hope Reagan 
will drop his neutrality and ride to his rescue It isnt as if 
Bush hasnt got a chance The weekend polls show him in a 
firstplace duel with Dole and he benefits from new lower 
expectations which have him fading away to his seaside home in 
Kennebunkport Me 
Kemp vowing to complete the Reagan revolution worked over 
the weekend to impress New Hampshire voters with his pledge not to 
raise taxes no matter what At one point during the day he said 
I am convinced that Sen Dole has a secret plan to raise taxes on 
the American people 
Kemp can kick around Bob Dole all he likes but the DoleBush 
struggle is irrelevant for now to his bid for survival He 
enjoyed strong poll figures on Iowa eve but his standing as 
conservative challenger to the frontrunners is now being blocked 
by the emergence of Pat Robertson 
Kemp said Sunday hell beat Robertson because the people of 
New Hampshire want a conservative who can reach out beyond just one 
segment of the population and win Forgotten for the moment is du 
Pont who hopes to sneak up on everyone Tuesday and live to fight 
another day So far he has amassed respect but not much support 
If Bush beats Dole or Kemp beats Robertson the topsy turvy GOP 
campaign will be topsy again Its a little known secret but the 
other party the Democrats are also holding a presidential primary 
Tuesday in New Hampshire 
Michael Dukakis has to win big and he probably will getting an 
honorable boost as it occurs to people that he handled the 
spotlight nicely and knows the issues better than his 
Washingtonbased opponents like to let on 
The Massachusetts governor already has set up shop in the South 
and in Minnesota caucuses a week from tomorrow keenly aware 
that the Massachusetts and Rhode Island primaries give him a 
spearhead on Super Tuesday 20 states March 8 that none of his 
opponents can easily match 
Richard Gephardt is slugging it out for second place with Simon 
Its remarkable that Simon is still in the hunt after halfadozen 
or so lackluster debates but he touches a tender nerve among party 
liberals and Gephardt has had trouble answering some of Simons 
negative ads which imply he isnt trustworthy If the Missouri 
congressman becomes ensnarled in the inconsistencies of his voting 
record Dukakis and Albert Gore Jr and Jesse Jackson will surely 
keep chipping away as the voting shifts South 
I hope to do much better than people expect on Tuesday Gore 
said during a strong antiGephardt performance over the weekend 
Babbitt and Hart trailed the pack in Iowa last week and are 
expected to spend their last dollar in futility Babbitt has waged 
a humanscale campaign of humor and candor But as du Pont can tell 
him you cant spend respect the former Arizona governor is 
running out of money 
Hart is threatening to go the distance no matter how pathetic 
his results may be But he already has an uncontrollable campaign 
debt from 1984 and its hard to see wholl extend him credit for 
the 48 states to come
