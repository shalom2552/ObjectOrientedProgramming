Bell Atlantic has formally told the General 
Services Administration that it won two government 
telecommunications projects honestly and without any information 
regarding any other offerors bid 
In a brief filed Friday with the GSAs Board of Contract 
Appeals Bell Atlantic said it should be awarded the contracts 
despite a complaint of improprieties in the bidding process 
The fact is Bell Atlantic won its contracts the 
oldfashioned way by bidding superior services at significantly 
lower prices than those proposed by ATampT the brief said 
The General Services Administration began investigating the 
awarding of a total of 55 million in contracts after ATampT 
complained last October that information on ATampTs pricing 
information was leaked to competitors 
Bell Atlantic asked the GSA board to rule that ATampTs 
allegations are incorrect in connection with the awarding of 
contracts to Bell Atlantic for electronic switches in Washington 
DC and Philadelphia 
Hearings on ATampTs protest are scheduled to begin Feb 16 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee which has 
investigated ATampTs allegations has said its probe found that 
Sureshar L Soni a GSA employee leaked secret information from 
ATampTs bids to at least two competing telephone companies 
Bell Atlantic maintained in its brief that its prices never 
changed It said it submitted its initial bids of 1840 per month 
for connection to a switch in Washington and 3050 in Philadelphia 
on April 1 1987 and those bids remained unchanged on the final 
dates for bids of Aug 19 in Washington and July 29 in Philadelphia
