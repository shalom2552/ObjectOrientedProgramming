The chief mediator in Nicaraguan peace 
talks offered a fivepoint proposal Thursday night in an attempt to 
break what he called an impasse between the Sandinista government 
and Contra rebels 
The Contras said they accepted the proposal by Cardinal Miguel 
Obando y Bravo in principle but the Sandinistas said it needed 
to be clarified in further talks Friday before they could respond 
Obando y Bravo the head of the Roman Catholic Church in 
Nicaragua called on the Contras to accept a 30day ceasefire in 
exchange for four major concessions by the government 
Those concessions were 
A full general amnesty for the several thousand political 
prisoners remaining in Nicaragua including members of former 
dictator Anastasio Somozas National Guard 
A promise to reconsider a mandatory military draft law that 
has sparked protests in some cities 
Full freedom of the press which now is extended only to a 
handful of communications outlets 
A dialogue with the Sandinistas internal opposition including 
14 dissident political parties and a coalition of business labor 
and political groups 
Victor Hugo Tinoco Nicaraguas deputy foreign minister said 
Obando y Bravo did not spell out conditions for the ceasefire as 
to when and where it would take place We have to clarify those 
points 
The requirements of the government were very clear and very 
well defined Tinoco said But the requirement for the 
Resistance was not as clear 
Tinoco said the cardinals proposal did not say whether the 
ceasefire should be countrywide or limited only to certain zones 
He said it also lacked any mention of a verification procedure 
Obando y Bravo told reporters he offered the proposal after the 
two sides could not agree on the terms of a ceasefire in the 
opening session of a second round of facetoface peace talks 
He said the Contras wanted to discuss a ceasefire in terms of 
unifying the Nicaraguan family through political reforms while 
the government sought to negotiate only a halt in hostilities 
Tinoco said the Sandinistas had offered the rebels a very 
very flexible proposal at their first round of direct talks in 
San Jose Costa Rica in late January 
Our attitude is fundamentally open Tinoco told reporters 
shortly before the talks resumed Thursday morning We are willing 
to listen to what they have to say on all aspects of a 
ceasefire 
Fernando Aguero one of seven Contra negotiators said his side 
also approached the talks with our minds open We hope we can 
make definite progrss in these negotiations 
The talks took place in church offices next to the Roman 
Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral where the presidents of five 
Central American nations prayed together after signing a peace 
accord last Aug 7 
It was that pact that brought the two sides in the 6yearold 
Nicaraguan conflict together first in indirect talks in the 
Dominican Republic late last year then in facetoface meetings 
The Sandinistas arrived at 3 pm passing about 75 Nicaraguan 
refugees who gathered outside the church offices chanting slogans 
and carrying antiSandinista banners 
Obando y Bravo arrived minutes later and met privately for about 
half an hour with the Sandinista delegation 
The Contras came to the meeting at 330 pm in a rented bus and 
were greeted as heroes by the protesters One rebel negotiator a 
field commander known as Commandante Tono held a fist aloft in 
defiance He was hugged and kissed by women demonstrators 
The Contras and Sandinistas sat down together and began talks at 
430 pm The discussions are due to continue through Saturday 
The first round of direct talks came one week before the House 
rejected President Reagans request for 362 million in additional 
Contra aid 
House Speaker Jim Wright and other Democratic leaders are trying 
to put together a new package that would provide only nonlethal 
assistance to see the Contras through a transition to peace 
The Contras want the talks to include the Sandinistas internal 
opposition primarily represented by a coalition of business labor 
and political groups known as the Democratic Coordinate 
The Coordinate and the Contras have called for 17 changes in the 
Nicaraguan Constitution including separation of the army from the 
Sandinista political party electoral reforms and the creation of a 
tribunal to guarantee constitutional rights 
The government has countered with a call for a 30day 
ceasefire during which the Contras would be confined to three 
zones totaling about 4000 square miles in the northern central 
and southern parts of the country 
During the ceasefire the Contras would be able to retain their 
arms and receive humanitarian aid from relief agencies At the end 
of the 30 days they would be required to either accept amnesty or 
leave the country
