Shares of Societe Generale de Belgique 
SA soared Monday as Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti launched 
his longawaited bid to take control of Belgiums largest holding 
company 
But dealers noted that Societe Generales shares which surged 
580 francs to 4730 francs or about 13514 each remained well 
above the 4000 francs a share de Benedetti has offered to pay 
Dealers predicted de Benedetti would wait for the price to fall 
before increasing his stake His current offer runs through March 4 
The Italian investor claims to be the largest single 
shareholder controlling through allies about 38 percent of Societe 
Generales stock He is seeking to acquire an additional 15 percent 
stake in the company 
Societe Generales shares traded at a record 4850 francs a 
share last Thursday But the shares plunged 700 francs each on 
Friday when a group of mostly Belgian investors failed to agree 
with Frances Compagnie Financiere de Suez to keep Societe Generale 
anchored in Belgium 
Failure to reach an agreement forced Belgian industrialist Andre 
Leysen head of the Gevaert NV holding company to quit as the 
groups spokesman strengthening De Benedettis hand 
De Benedetti is seeking to run the daytoday operation of 
Societe Generale which controls a third of the Belgian economy 
and turn the company into a panEuropean holding enterprise 
The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around Leysen said 
it controlled 28 percent of the companys outstanding shares while 
Suez claimed 15 percent But together with various small allies 
Leysen said the bloc would have been assured of absolute majority 
at shareholders meetings 
Rumors surfaced as to a possible replacement for Leysen but no 
one has yet been named 
Economic Affairs Minister Phillipe Maystadt said over the 
weekend that vital sectors of the economy that are controlled 
by Societe Generale would still be subject to a government veto 
whoever holds a majority stake in the company 
Above and beyond all the financial games we must return to 
the essential point for Belgium which is that certain strategic 
sectors remain under Belgian control Maystadt said 
In recent weeks trading of Societe Generale shares off the 
Brussels stock exchange often outweighed official trading with 
anonymous buyers paying premium rates for the companys shares 
Last Thursday the unofficial share price rose as high as 5300 
francs 
Traders said they could not tell Monday who bought Societe 
Generale shares
