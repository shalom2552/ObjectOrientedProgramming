The company that made President Reagans new 
hearing aid is thinking of nicknaming it the Jellybean in honor of 
the sweet tooth of its most famous customer 
We used to say it was the size of a cashew nut but he 
Reagan reminded me its also the size of a jellybean Thomas A 
Powers an executive of Siemens Hearing Instruments Inc said 
Wednesday 
We may start to call it the Jellybean said Powers the 
director of professional relations for Siemens After all hes 
the president 
Reagan last week began wearing a 1900 Siemens hearing aid 
equipped with a remotecontrol device for screening out unwanted 
noise The publicity helped spur sales of hearing aids to the 
general public 
President Reagan deserves recognition for being willing to 
publicly acknowledge that he wears a hearing aid said Helmut 
Ermann president of the Piscataway NJbased subsidiary of West 
Germanys Siemens AG 
Ermann said Reagan is sending a very powerful message to many 
millions of people all over the world really whose quality of 
life is adversely affected by hearing loss 
Reagans new hearing aid for which he was fitted in December 
can be switched to pick up telephone signals preventing the 
whistling sound of feedback that comes from holding the receiver 
against the ear 
Reagan dates his hearing loss to the noise of a gun going off by 
his ear during his acting days in Hollywood He wears a hearing aid 
in each ear
