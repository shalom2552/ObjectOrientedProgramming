President Reagan is planning to name William 
A Brown a leading expert on Soviet affairs as the new US 
ambassador to Israel a senior US official said today 
Brown 57 now the US envoy to Thailand will replace Thomas 
R Pickering a career foreign service officer who has served in 
Tel Aviv since 1985 and is being considered for another post in the 
State Department 
Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate Brown will play an 
important role in the growing US drive to promote peace talks 
between Israel and Jordan 
His job would entail trying to persuade a reluctant Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to yield territory on the West Bank in 
exchange for a settlement 
Shamirs resistance to a concession opposed by the Likud 
coalition could test the diplomatic skill of the 32year veteran of 
the foreign service 
Brown served as deputy ambassador to Tel Aviv the United 
States does not recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital from 1979 
to 1981 He is known primarily as an expert in Soviet and Asian 
affairs and as a linguist 
Brown a Harvard graduate and exMarine speaks Russian 
Chinese French Japanese Mongolian and Malay He was a leading 
contender for the ambssadors post in Moscow probably the most 
important in the foreign service before Jack Matlock was selected 
by Reagan in January 1987 
One of the touchy angles in US diplomacy in the Middle East is 
the role to be played by the Soviet Union Jordan insists on 
Moscows taking an active part while Shamir is opposed to its 
participation in consideration of an ArabIsraeli settlement 
Shamirs two main reasons are that the Soviets generally support 
Arab positions and Moscow does not have diplomatic relations with 
Israel Ties were broken by the Soviets in 1967 when Israel 
defeated Egypt Jordan and Syria in the SixDay war 
Last year however the Soviets sent a diplomatic delegation to 
Israel and a small Israeli group is likely to go to the Soviet 
Union this year
