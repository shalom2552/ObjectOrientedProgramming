Emissions of lead into the atmosphere took 
another sharp drop in 1986 due to the reduction of lead in 
gasoline according to the annual air pollution report released 
Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency 
Though most of the six major pollutants showed only minor 
changes from the year before lead emissions fell 59 percent an 
even sharper drop than the 47 percent seen the year before 
according to the report 
Another sharp decline was seen in peak quarterly concentrations 
measured by the 82 instruments in EPAs lead monitoring network 
The average maximum quarterly reading fell 35 percent 
Lead emissions peaked in 1976 at 169000 tons of which 146000 
tons came from the gasoline burned in cars and trucks according to 
EPAs estimates Starting in 1975 most new cars could not use 
leaded gasoline because it would disable the new exhaust pollution 
equipment and all new cars had to use leadfree gasoline in 1980 
Emissions fell to 44200 tons in 1984 and the following year 
EPA started its twoyear reduction of permissible lead 
concentrations in gasoline from 11 gram per gallon to 01 gram 
That reduced emissions to 23300 tons in 1985 and 9500 tons in 
1986 
Some major companies have stopped selling leaded gasoline as a 
smaller number of older cars each year may legally use it Its 
share of the market shrank from 31 percent in 1986 to 26 percent in 
1987 
I would predict a continued dramatic improvement in next 
years annual report said Craig Potter EPAs assistant 
administrator for air programs 
EPA has proposed removing the last lead from gasoline but 
action on that has been stalled by the fears of farmers that they 
will ruin old but still vital farm engines that need leaded 
gasoline 
Lead is a poison causing kidney and brain damage in high enough 
concentrations EPA believes there is new evidence it raises blood 
pressure at least in men 
It is also the cheapest way to boost gasoline octane and before 
engine manufacturers switched to hardened valve seats in 19711975 
many engines relied on lead deposits to lubricate valves the 
point that worries farmers 
EPA said 45 million people unchanged from the previous years 
report lived in counties where the airborne lead concentration 
standard is violated 
Those violations came near smelters The report listed these 
eight cities where the standard of 15 micrograms per cubic meter 
was exceeded for a quarter The figures are the peak quarterly 
average in micrograms per cubic meter near the smelter and the 
peak reading in a residential area 
Philadelphia 172 014 St Louis 570 035 Minneapolis 
209 014 Seattle 182 026 Indianapolis 249 014 
Birmingham Ala 230 030 Gary Ind 181 016 and El Paso 
Texas 157 058 
There were no surprises elsewhere in the report and EPA said it 
had not changed its estimate that about 100 million people live in 
counties where one or more concentration standards is violated 
Here is a rundown of the other major pollutants with emissions 
from 1985 and 1986 followed by average concentrations in EPAs 
monitoring networks 
Carbon monoxide from 709 million tons to 671 million tons 
and from 719 parts per million to 721 parts per million in the 
secondhighest eighthour average a blip upward EPA considers no 
real change at all The standard is 90 ppm Carbon monoxide can 
worsen heart problems since it displaces oxygen in the blood 
Sulfur dioxide from 238 million tons to 234 million tons and 
from 885 micrograms per cubic meter to 864 micrograms averaged 
over the year The annual standard is 80 micrograms Sulfur dioxide 
causes breathing difficulties and can turn into acid rain EPA has 
revised upward slightly its estimates of emissions over the last 
nine years 
Volatile organic compounds like unburned gasoline that form 
ozone from 224 million tons to 215 million tons Ozone 
concentrations fell from 0127 ppm to 0123 ppm measured as the 
secondhighest onehour reading 
Nitrogen dioxide which also causes breathing problems helps 
form ozone and can be transformed into acid rain from 217 million 
tons to 213 million tons and from 00251 ppm to 00248 ppm 
measured as an annual average The standard calls for 0053 ppm 
Smoke dust and soot what EPA calls total suspended 
particulates from 77 million tons to 75 million tons and from 
485 micrograms per cubic meter to 484 micrograms This is the 
last year total suspended particulates will be listed as a 
pollutant EPA is switching to counting as a pollutant only the 
fine particles that penetrate the lung
