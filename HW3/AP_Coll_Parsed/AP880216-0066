popular actor who was expected to run for president was 
assassinated at his home today a day after his political alliance 
condemned recent killings by radical Sinhalese nationalists

on the outlawed Peoples Liberation Front an ultranationalist 
Sinhalese group 
Kumaranatunga 43 led the Sri Lankan Mahajana Peoples Party 
and was expected to run as a candidate for president with the 
backing of his party and two other small leftist groups

the gunfire 
Kamaranatungas body was sprawled under a mango tree with a 
bullet hole through an appointment book he was carrying witnesses 
said Relatives said he was about to leave for a luncheon at the 
American Embassy 
Besides condemining radical Sinhalese terrorists Kumaranatunga 
was a supporter of the IndianSri Lankan peace accord that aims to 
end the insurgency by separatists from the Tamil minority 
The Peoples Liberation Front has vowed to kill anyone who 
supports the accord and President Junius R Jayewardene has blamed 
the front for the deaths of more than 150 government officials and 
members of his United National Party 
Hundreds of people gathered at Kamaranatungas home and Colombo

other leftist parties issued a strongly worded statement condemning 
killings of politicians by the Peoples Liberation Front 
Kumaratunga was also one of the earliest and most vocal 
supporters of the July 29 peace accord which was sponsored by 
India and designed to end a 4yearold Tamil separatist guerrilla 
war that has left about 8000 people dead

Party opposes the accord was prime minister from 1960 to 1965 and 
from 1970 to 1977 Her husband SWFD Bandaranaike was prime 
minister from 1956 until his assassination in 1959

75 percent of Sri Lankas 16 million people 
Tamils who account for 18 percent claim they are discriminated 
against by the Sinhalese who control the government and military 
India sent troops to its island neighbor last July to enforce 
the peace pact After Tamil rebels rejected the accord and went on 
a killing spree against Sinhalese civilians India launched an Oct 
10 offensive to disarm the largest rebel group the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
India says between 45000 and 48000 of its soldiers are now 
deployed in Sri Lanka to disarm the rebels
