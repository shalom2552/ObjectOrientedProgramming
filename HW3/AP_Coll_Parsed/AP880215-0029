Residents here speak with awe about the 
changes facing this town with its empty houses and idle plants 
when the Navy breaks ground this week for a 140 million home port 
for the battleship Wisconsin 
Naval Station Ingleside won in a bidding competition among Gulf 
Coast communities from Texas to Florida is welcomed locally as a 
boost for a region that has endured hard times in the oil and 
shrimping industries 
Still in a town with 5000 people and one traffic light there 
is a touch of fear in the voices of residents who know their lives 
may be changed forever by the thousands of people and millions in 
revenues the port is expected to attract by its scheduled 
completion in 1991 Besides the Wisconsin the port will be home to 
the training carrier Lexington and three other ships 
I dont know if you can prepare yourself for that kind of 
change said Del Lewis manager of this town just north of Corpus 
Christi I dont know if you can visualize the change and looking 
out and seeing the ships on the horizon 
Direct economic effects from the port will include a 155 
million payroll for military personnel 47 million in ship repair 
and 100 million in local procurement by the Navy for the 482acre 
project according to Navy estimates 
In addition local economies will enjoy an infusion of 300 
million from a boom in real estate services and other indirect 
effects of the station said Jimmy Lyles president of the Corpus 
Christi Chamber of Commerce 
Youll have a good tax base new housing new shopping 
centers said Ms Lewis In the meantime its going to be you 
pedal very fast and you dont fall over 
Local officials are concerned that the speed and breadth of the 
project will overwhelm city services like water and sewage 
treatment in a town with an annual budget of 25 million and 42 
people on its payroll 
Although real estate growth eventually will drive up the 
property tax base and fill up vacancies resulting primarily from a 
decline in oilrig manufacturing the town has to accommodate a 
rapidly growing population before that money starts flowing in 
Ive been worried for quite a while said Mayor Roy Culver 
That doesnt mean were going to throw up our hands and quit Im 
concerned about expanding our police department Im concerned 
about infrastructure extensions Im concerned about whether our 
city hall is big enough 
The Navy which chose the Ingleside site in part because of the 
deep channel in its port area estimates that the base will employ 
4665 military personnel and 574 civilians An additional 3200 
offbase civilian jobs also are projected 
At least 500 construction jobs at the naval station will be 
created this year reaching a peak of 1000 in 1990 Lyles said 
Overall as many as 18000 new people are projected to live in 
the area after the base is fully operational in 1991 including 
those involved in nonmilitary businesses that will serve the new 
military and civilian workforce and its dependents 
Already two commercial developments totaling more than 150 
million in value have begun in Ingleside 
What it will do is take us off of being oil and gas 
dependent the mayor said Its going to be a big boon to 
Ingleside if its handled properly 
One fear however is that the area will find itself filled with 
more unemployed construction workers than there are jobs available 
Others worry that the areas tranquility will be destroyed Culver 
said 
There are a lot of people in Ingleside who moved over here 
because its quiet its a bedroom community he said Theyre 
worried about strip joints you know Theres a lot of things that 
come into peoples minds when they think of a Navy town
