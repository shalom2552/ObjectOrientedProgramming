A sixyear series of criminal trials has 
left the public with an image of the county sheriff as an 
uneducated redneck in reflector sunglasses who doesnt mind bending 
and even breaking the law officials say 
The sheriffs dont talk about it much publicly but I think 
its embarrassing to them when these other sheriffs get in trouble 
with the law said Lawson White executive director of the 
Tennessee Sheriffs Association 
They talk privately about how dang stupid it is Lawson said 
last week after Henderson County Sheriff Jack Fowler pleaded guilty 
to charges he sexually abused inmates in his jail in Lexington 
near Memphis 
The string of arrests has left other officials wondering how to 
prevent further tarnishing of their Walking Tall image 
The 1973 movie about McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pussers 
fight against crime depicted the Southern sheriff as a courageous 
tough individual who risked his life for law and order 
Fowler is among 12 Tennessee sheriffs or exsheriffs indicted on 
criminal charges since 1982 Most of the cases stemmed from charges 
they sold confiscated drugs or received bribes to protect drug 
runners 
Officials say the arrests point to the need for changes in the 
way voters choose their countys top law enforcement leader 
The sheriffs association anxious to boost its image and 
performance in Tennessee voted in 1986 to ask the Legislature to 
set stricter standards for anyone seeking the office But the bill 
was rejected 5042 by the state House 
Right now the only requirements to be a sheriff in Tennessee 
is to be at least 18 years old live in the county you run for 
office in and be alive White said 
The bill would have required sheriffs to hold at least a high 
school diploma and to have lived in the county for 18 months 
preceding an election or appointment It also would have set 
training standards and require that a candidate for sheriff not 
have a felony record 
State Rep Mayo Wix a former sheriff and sponsor of the 
legislation contends such standards are needed because of the 
delicate balance of duties entrusted to sheriffs 
In the more populated counties the sheriff is considered mainly 
an administrator But in smaller ones they must be administrator 
investigator and jailer among other things 
It was the hardest job I ever had Wix said of his six years 
as Sumner County Sheriff 
He says the public should remember that the days of the good 
ol boy sheriff when the countys top law enforcement officer 
was elected on the basis of popularity than qualifications are 
slowly dying as populations increase and voters demand more 
Its changing little by little he said The bad sheriffs 
are getting weeded out and the good sheriffs are running on their 
record and getting reelected 
Despite support for the bill from all but two of the states 95 
sheriffs Wix says he has no plans to reintroduce it immediately 
Lawmakers were hesitant to tamper with the system Wix said 
They felt that anybody should be able to run for public office 
regardless of their education he said Even the president of 
the United States doesnt have to have a high school degree
