Domestic car and truck sales boosted by 
aggressive buyer incentive programs rose 28 percent in early 
February over the same period a year ago automakers reported 
Monday 
Sales are very strong We havent seen a major downturn in the 
market yet although many were expecting one said Chris 
Cedergren an industry analyst with JD Power and Associates in 
Agoura Calif 
Car makers sold 192001 domestically built cars and 102754 
domestically built light trucks in the nine selling days from Feb 
110 up from 170134 cars and 84734 trucks in eight days in the 
same period a year ago 
Sales are compared on the basis of average daily sales during a 
period rather than on straight totals While car sales rose only 
03 percent from early February 1987 truck sales climbed 78 
percent 
On a seasonally adjusted basis cars were selling at an annual 
rate of 84 million vehicles indicating dealers were doing a brisk 
business in early February 
The market will probably subside in midFebruary but a 
major sales dive isnt likely Cedergren said 
Among the Big Three automakers General Motors Corps car sales 
fell 42 percent against early February 1987 but sales of 
domestically built GM trucks rose 46 percent GMs share of both 
markets shrank however 
Industryleader GM held 509 percent of the domestic car market 
down from 533 percent a year ago and 407 percent of the truck 
market down from 419 percent a year ago 
Ford Motor Co the nations secondlargest automaker sold 59 
percent more domestic cars than a year ago and 37 percent more 
trucks Fords share of the car market grew to 288 percent from 
273 percent a year ago but its domestic truck share fell to 355 
percent from 369 percent a year ago 
No 3 Chrysler Corps sales of domestically built cars jumped 
128 percent and its share of that market increased to 149 
percent from 133 percent a year ago 
Chryslers domestic truck sales rose 246 percent in early 
February while its market share grew to 221 percent from 192 
percent a year ago 
Cedergren said Chrysler suffering from large inventories cut 
production and offered the most aggressive buyer incentives in the 
market 
American Honda Motor Co the No 4 US automaker suffered a 
15 percent drop in sales from early February 1987 and its share of 
the market shrank to 38 percent from 44 percent a year ago 
But Cedergren blamed Hondas lost sales on short supply of its 
popular cars Demand outstripped production he said adding 
that Honda has only a 10 to 12day supply of domestic cars 
compared with an industry norm of 6065 days supply 
Nissan Motor Corps US car sales tumbled 455 percent in 
early February and its domestic truck sales fell 107 percent 
making it the only domestic maker whose truck sales declined 
Nissans been having problems all year Nissan has been the 
least tolerant of yeninduced price increases Even though the cars 
are Americanbuilt much of the componentry is brought from 
Japan Cedergren said 
Nissans USbuild Sentra subcompact sedan and coupe have 
suffered from increased competition in the smallcar segment of the 
market he noted
