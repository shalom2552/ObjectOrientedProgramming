The stock market put together a moderate gain 
today in a muted response to news of a smaller US trade deficit 
Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that 
the trade deficit narrowed to 1220 billion in December from 
1322 billion the month before 
The figure came in at the low end of analysts estimates and 
lent support to the growing belief that the international trade 
situation was improving American exports set a record for the 
second straight month 
But analysts said traders in the stock and bond markets didnt 
see the news as entirely positive 
Given the strength it showed in US manufacturing they said 
the chances seemed less that the Federal Reserve might soon relax 
its credit policy further Interest rates rose and prices declined 
in the credit markets 
Another apparent drag on the markets was the Labor Departments 
report that the producer price index of finished goods rose 04 
percent in January after falling about the same amount in December
