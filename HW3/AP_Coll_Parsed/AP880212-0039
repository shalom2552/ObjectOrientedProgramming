Near blizzard conditions disrupted 
presidential campaigns and almost brought the state to a halt 
Friday with up to two feet of snow predicted and winds gusting to 
60 mph 
Its terrible out there state police dispatcher Norman St 
Hilaire said Friday Weir Lundstedt of the National Weather Service 
in Concord added Its not a day to go out and challenge the 
storm 
The weather played havoc with campaign schedules as candidates 
worked feverishly to win support before Tuesdays presidential 
primary 
Staff members scrambled to revise schedules as most candidates 
had to scrap events Several were having trouble flying in or out 
of the state with airports closed Bob Dole had planned to travel 
to New Orleans and Pat Robertson had hoped to go to Washington 
Neither got out of the state 
Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr both in Virginia and Jack 
Kemp in Washington were trying to get to New Hampshire 
Only Richard Gephardt had a campaign event made to order for 
such a day he was to watch a dog sled race at Opechee Park in 
Laconia 
The curtailed campaigning also put a crimp in news coverage 
Television crews covering Vice President George Bush who was 
holed up in his hotel part of the day dashed outside to film the 
storm to show why candidates were notcampaigning 
The Weather Service predicted the storm should end after 
midnight
