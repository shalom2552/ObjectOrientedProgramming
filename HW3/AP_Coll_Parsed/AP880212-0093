Leaders of the European Economic 
Community reached agreement early Saturday on agricultural 
spending ending nearly a year of deadlock a spokesman for the 
executive commission said 
We have an agreement on a farm package We are having a good 
summit European Commission spokesman Nico Wegter told reporters 
at the end of the twoday meeting 
The agreement came after significant concessions by Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain who had sought stringent 
budgetary controls to end soaring farm spending 
It has been a very tough European Council Mrs Thatcher 
said early Saturday But what is important is that for the first 
time we have effective and legally binding controls on 
expenditure 
The accord set production limits on the most expensive crops 
Grains and oilseeds and proteins with penalty price cuts for 
surpluses 
It was the third summit attempt in eight months to solve the 
financial crisis The 12nation EEC or European Common Market has 
operated without a budget since December 
Proposals endorsed by West Germany current president of the 
EEC envisaged looser curbs on the communitys farm spending than 
Britain initially was willing to tolerate 
The community agreement boosted by 80 percent over the next five 
years regional aid to the four poorest members Spain Portugal 
Greece and Ireland The increase will bring regional aid to 1625 
billion by 1992 compared with a 50 percent rise favored by the 
wealthier states inluding Britain France and West Germany 
West German spokesman Friedhelm Ost said his countrys 
chancellor Helmut Kohl did his best to change Mrs Thatchers 
mind in private talks Friday evening 
The chancellor made it clear we now have arrived at the 
outer limits of what we can do Ost told reporters 
On the key issue of overall limits on farm spending which 
consumes twothirds of the EECs annual budget the lastminute 
compromise document called for a 344 billion maximum this year 
slightly higher than in 1987 
That was consistent with British demands compared with a 369 
billion limit favored by West Germany and France 
The compromise document also called for a 160million metric ton 
annual limit on cereal production the level wanted by West 
Germany and France compared with 155 million tons sought by 
Britain 
Every ton above the 155 million costs the EEC about 175 million 
annually in export subsidies 
As a sweetener to Britain and the Netherlands the proposals 
called for a 9 percent price cut spread over three years from 1989 
On the other most expensive crops oil seeds the final proposal 
called for price cuts and production quotas midway between British 
and other demands
