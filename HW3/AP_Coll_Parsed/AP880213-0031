Richard Gephardt angrily demanded that 
rival presidential aspirant Paul Simon take attack 
advertisements off the airwaves or take off the bow tie that 
is the Illinois senators trademark 
Simon responded We may be changing ads but were not going 
to do it in response to his request 
Gephardt aides meanwhile said they would unveil new ads today 
responding to Simons spots but they declined to give details 
Three days before the first primary of the 1988 presidential 
season Gephardt also turned up the heat Friday on Massachusetts 
Gov Michael Dukakis who holds a commanding lead in New Hampshire 
polls 
If the state of the state of Massachusetts that he gave this 
year becomes the state of the union next year Americans 
individual income taxes are going to go up Gephardt said at an 
impromptu news conference after a state Democratic Party dinner 
But Gephardt was most bitter toward Simon The Illinois senator 
this week began airing ads on television and radio that point out 
inconsistencies in Gephardts record as a Missouri congressman 
and question his trustworthiness 
Gephardt and Simon have acknowledged they essentially are 
fighting to place second in New Hampshire Simon on Friday 
acknowledged that a poor thirdplace showing would force him to 
consider dropping out of the race 
Simon Gephardt Dukakis and former Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt 
addressed the Democrats dinner Dukakis standing between Simon 
and Gephardt joked You guys getting along Anything I could do 
to help 
Simon did not mention the dispute in his speech but Gephardt 
said Ive been attacked lately in this campaign and thats okay 
with me He cited criticism by Simon and Dukakis of his votes for 
taxreform bills in 1981 and 1986 and said I did it I really 
did it I voted to cut your taxes 
I just want Paul and Mike to know that when this is all over 
were going to be friends And if they keep telling people that Im 
a tax cutter then were going to be even better friends than we 
are today Gephardt said 
Afterward Simon met with reporters and said of the dispute with 
Gephardt As long as it doesnt get too acrimonious I think a 
healthy comparison is good for the electorate both here in New 
Hampshire and around the nation 
But minutes later Gephardt held his own news conference and 
escalated his attacks saying Simons ad impugns my character and 
my integrity by saying can you trust this man 
Ive never impugned Paul Simons character Ive disagreed 
with a lot of his crazy ideas but I have never once questioned 
Paul Simons motives or his integrity or whether he could be 
trusted Gephardt said 
I asked Sen Simon to take those ads off television And if he 
doesnt he ought to take off the bow tie because hes just another 
politician as long as theyre on 
Gephardts campaign counsel earlier sent telegrams to television 
stations in Boston Manchester NH and Portsmouth Maine saying 
Simons ads contain a savage and willfully inaccurate attack 
and asking stations either to discontinue the attack 
advertisements or sell Gephardt time for a response ad 
The counsel Bob Bauer said the stations have generally agreed 
to sell Gephardt such time for the ad which will begin running 
today Gephardt aides would not describe the ads contents
