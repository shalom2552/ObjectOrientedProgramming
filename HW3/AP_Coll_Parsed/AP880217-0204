New Hampshires primary results produced a new 
flurry of speculation on Wednesday that the Democratic presidential 
campaign might end without a clear winner leading to a deadlocked 
nominating convention next summer 
But Democratic party chairman Paul Kirk predicted were going 
to have a firstballot winner among the current contenders 
It was New York Mayor Ed Koch who responded to the New Hampshire 
returns by saying that delegates to the Democratic convention would 
draft either New York Gov Mario Cuomo or New Jersey Sen Bill 
Bradley 
I believe there will be a draft he said The strategy 
which was not a strategy to begin with but which is working 
marvelously is not to come in but to be drafteed at the 
convention 
Bradley has consistently said he is not interested in entering 
the 1988 presidential race while Cuomo has said he is not a 
candidate but has not flatly ruled out a late entry 
The governor on Wednesday had kind words for virtually all the 
seven Democratic contenders but told reoporters it was still too 
early for him to bestow his endorsement on any of them 
Theres a long way to go he said 
Cuomos support has been sought avidly by several of the 
Democratic hopefuls in advance of the April 19 New York primary 
Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis scored a decisive triumph in 
the New Hampshire primary with Missouri Rep Richard Gephardt a 
distant second and Illinois Sen Paul Simon just behind him in 
third place The outcome which had been expected left the field 
without a clear frontrunner and with a crowded roster of 
candidates heading into the delegaterich primaries and caucuses 
ahead 
But Kirk speaking with reporters in Washington said the 
players who are on the field thats where the games going to be 
won 
Kirk said he had no doubt the field of candidates would begin to 
shrink as the primary season runs its course 
I dont believe for a minute that youll have six candidates 
running neck and neck right down to the convention As we move down 
to the final innings youll see signs of a final person 
emerging he said 
Walter F Mondales 1984 campaign manager political consultant 
Robert G Beckel said he thought it appeared less and less likely 
that any of the seven Democratic candidates would arrive at the 
nominating convention with enough delegates to claim a victory on 
the first ballot 
I believe there will be brokering he said meaning that the 
frontrunning candidates at convention time would need alliances 
with their rivals for enough delegate support to win 
But he said that didnt mean a draft candidate emerging 
If theyre going to negotiate with anybody theyll negotiate 
with each other he said of the current contenders
