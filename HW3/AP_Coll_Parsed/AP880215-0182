One diehard puffer threw a kicking and hitting 
tantrum on the Long Island Rail Road but otherwise nosmoking 
rules took effect Monday with grumbling acceptance by New York 
commuter rail riders 
The violent reaction came on the 610 am train from Manhattan 
to Babylon when William Mackney 30 of Island Park was asked to 
put out his cigarette according to LIRR spokesman Brian Dolan 
He became abusive and then allegedly kicked the assistant 
conductor and the conductor then became involved and the man 
kicked the conductor and then the passenger allegedly struck the 
assistant conductor in the face Dolan said 
Railroad police took Mackney off at Jamaica Queens and charged 
with one count each of harassment and criminal possession of a 
controlled substance Dolan said The possession charge was filed 
when Mackney could not provide a prescription or other 
documentation for seven Valium pills in his possession the 
spokesman said 
Other protests were verbal 
I think were more discriminated against than anyone else 
around said Julie Sullivan of Danbury Conn who lit up while 
waiting for a Metro North train at the North White Plains station 
Kathleen Macklowe who sells computers pulled strongly on a 
cigarette as she waited to board her LIRR train in Mineola 
I have one maybe two before I board she said I light 
up as soon as I get off 
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority parent of the 
railroads voted last month to outlaw smoking under threat of 
losing federal mass transit funds 
Among those welcoming the ban was Jan Schoenfeld a salesman and 
onetime packaday smoker from Mineola 
I literally quit smoking because of the putrid smoking cars 
said Schoenfeld We were caged in that smoking car and couldnt 
breathe I had to quit to survive 
Dan Brucker of Metro North said the law would be enforced in a 
gentlemanly manner and that smokers would be get summonses 
only if they refuse to put out their cigarettes when asked There 
were no plans to put smokers off trains he said 
Violators face fines of up to 100 
A hearing has been scheduled for Feb 25 in a suit against the 
ban filed in state Supreme Court in White Plains 
The LIRR collects 272000 fares on an average day and Metro 
North collects just under 190000
