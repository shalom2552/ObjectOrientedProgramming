Former Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt on Thursday 
became the first Democrat to quit the presidential race in 1988 
declaring an end to an underdog candidacy that he called the 
greatest joy of my entire public life 
Babbitt told a roomful of family supporters and reporters that 
he is abandoning the race in the wake of dismal showings in Iowa 
and New Hampshire but he is not abandoning his cause an America 
that comes to grips with its future 
Babbitt said he will not yet endorse any of the six remaining 
Democratic contenders They are all firstrate people and I could 
support any one of them he said 
Babbitt whose campaign was centered around economic themes 
including a frank call for a national sales tax said the Democrats 
must give our country a compelling reason to elect us to power 
Im going to wait and watch and do everything I can to insure 
the success of our party he said 
Babbitt finished fifth in Iowa last week and sixth in New 
Hampshire on Tuesday 
He seemed relaxed and even upbeat as he explained that probably 
a thousand things went wrong for his campaign 
Ultimately he likened his race to a stranger riding into town 
for a Fourth of July party and telling everyone that the party is 
over and its time to rebuild the town 
Its asking an awful lot in the course of a campaign before 
the American people to say consider both a new messenger and a 
challenging and different message he said 
Throughout his news conference Babbitt displayed the 
selfdeprecating wit he has carried through the campaign that he 
launched last March 10 
Babbitt joked that his appearance on NBCs comedy show 
Saturday Night Live was undoubtedly the high point of this 
campaign 
Asked if he was worried about the nations future if taxes are 
not increased to reduce the huge budget deficit he quipped 
Look Im not going to slash my throat if we dont raise taxes 
tomorrow 
And he said one friend told him You fought a good fight you 
were in it right up to the beginning 
I dont know why we fared no better Ill leave that for 
others to ponder he said 
As his wife Hattie and two young sons looked on Babbitt said 
This campaign has been the hardest work and greatest joy of my 
entire public life Ill not forget any of it 
Hinting at a possible future candidacy he added I cant say 
Id rush to do it again but I might 
Indeed diehard Babbitt admirers at his campaign office in 
Concord NH answered the phone Babbitt in 92 
He recalled the occasions during his campaign when he asked 
people to stand up if they supported his call for candor 
especially his plan to tackle the federal deficit with a national 
sales tax 
Ill never forget the people in audience after audience who 
stood up out of their chair to join me in a demonstration of belief 
for the politics of truth he said 
Asked if he would consider the vicepresidential spot he 
quipped My advice to the nominee would be You probably 
ought to select a vicepresidential candidate from a state with 
more than seven electoral votes 
He added that if reincarnated he would try to be from the 
neighboring delegaterich state of Texas 
Referring to the generally favorable press coverage he received 
Babbitt jokingly accused reporters of a deliberate conspiracy to 
destroy my candidacy by making me into kind of a house pet to 
destroy my credibility with the American people 
Babbitt was the subject of many favorable articles often 
focusing on the substance of his economic proposals his 
willingness to risk the unpopular taxincrease message and his 
generally unpretentious style 
In New Hampshire Babbitt had hoped to get at least 10 percent 
but he garnered only 5 percent ahead of only former Sen Gary Hart 
Hart urged him to stay in the contest when the two spoke Tuesday 
night and told him Youve got something to say Youre a 
courageous guy Babbitt related 
Babbitts staff said the campaign has about 150000 to 200000 
in bills to pay off 
His announcement Thursday concluded a campaign that used often 
nontraditional attentiongetters his bicycle ride across Iowa 
an ascent of Mount Washington in New Hampshire and a rugged 
crosscountry ski tour in northern Arizona 
He said his immediate plans include a trip to Mexico with his 
family and doing fixup work around his Arizona home 
Asked how he will now earn a living Babbitt smiled broadly and 
cocked his head toward his attorney wife saying Hattie
