Twenty states in recent years have conducted tax 
amnesty programs most of them with enormous success 
In New York State about 151000 people sought to pay up without 
penalty in 198586 bringing 392 million to the treasury that 
otherwise might not have been collected 
Illinois raised 1591 million California 1468 million and 
Michigan 1017 million Massachusetts collected 863 million 
about four times what it had projected 
Viewed as an investment the states did spectacularly New York 
spent 28 million to bring in 140 times that amount Illinois 
cost was 2 million and Californias 58 million 
Impressive as they might be those figures tell only a fraction 
of the benefits that accrued to states 
The states discovered continuing sources of higher revenue 
because they were able to identify those who had heretofore eluded 
identification And honest taxpayers were reassured that they 
werent carrying an unfair burden 
Moreover the amnesty programs generally were followed by more 
disciplined administrative procedures to assure that evasion 
wouldnt be so attractive in the future 
And that brings up the question With the US Congress having 
spent two decades wrestling with budget deficits should an amnesty 
program be considered on a national level 
The significance of that question descends with a shock on 
anyone familiar with the 1983 US Treasury estimate that more than 
100 billion a year of federal revenue is lost because of 
underreporting and nonreporting 
The question of a federal amnesty isnt new having been 
discussed in the media academic circles and Congress President 
Reagan has expressed concern about underpayment Honest and 
dishonest taxpayers have supported the idea 
Now there is more grist for the argument with publication of a 
study of state amnesty programs by a college professor that 
suggests there are ways to assure a program success 
Working under a fellowship from the Rockefeller Institute Ram 
L Chugh economist at the State University of New York at Potsdam 
found that the most successful programs were followed by tougher 
penalties immediately thereafter 
Chugh found that guilt and gratitude were among the three most 
important motivations in successful programs The other factor 
cited most often of the three was fear 
Amnesty programs in several states were accompanied by 
warnings that tax enforcement would be much stricter after the 
amnesty period said Chugh And in the more successful programs 
publicity reinforced those warnings 
There are lessons for the country in the experience of the 
states one of them being that failure to pay taxes isnt always to 
save the money Ignorance of the law was cited Confusion was 
mentioned Divorce Procrastination too 
While criminality is an obvious factor in the failure to pay 
taxes there are many reasons some apparently involving simple 
human failings One of those may be a failure to understand the tax 
system 
That much becomes clear not so much from Chughs study as from 
the differing answers given to the same questions by those 
interpreting the tax laws including the Internal Revenue Services 
own personnel 
Whatever the reasons the consequences cannot be measured in 
money alone Chugh comments that tax evasion in its various forms 
has grown more serious in recent years leading to significant 
social and economic consequences 
For one thing he says the honest taxpayer ends up bearing 
the additional tax burden And he suggests the existence of a 
huge element of nonpayers actually distorts official data on the 
economys performance
