An afternoon rally carried stock prices higher 
in moderate trading today in spite of a continued rise of interest 
rates in the credit markets 
The stock market was closed Monday for the Presidents Day 
holiday 
Analysts said stock prices were depressed in the morning by 
higher interest rates But the bond market erased some of its 
losses later in the day and stock prices climbed in the afternoon 
The price of the benchmark 30year Treasury bond down 10 for 
each 1000 in face value in the morning was down only about 340 
by the end of the New York Stock Exchange session 
Bond prices had begun to fall Friday following several 
government economic reports pointing to stable or higher interest 
rates 
The government said the nations trade deficit narrowed to 122 
billion in December but interest rates rose on speculation the 
trade figures reflected economic strength which could prevent the 
Federal Reserve from easing credit 
Furthermore the Labor Department reported a 04 percent rise in 
wholesale prices in January following a decline of about the same 
size in December
