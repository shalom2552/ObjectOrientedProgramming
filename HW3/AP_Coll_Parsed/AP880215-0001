Egypt and Jordan said Monday the United 
States should not advance interim solutions to the Palestinian 
problem and urged that any US peace plan aim for a final 
settlement through an international conference 
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Prime Minister Zaid Rifai 
of Jordan separately outlined that position in remarks to 
reporters Rifai arrived in Cairo Monday for a oneday visit 
US Secretary of State George Shultz will visit the Middle East 
at the end of this month 
Officials in Washington and Israel have said a new US peace 
plan was outlined to Arab and Israeli leaders by Richard Murphy 
the assistant secretary of state for near Eastern affairs 
The Egyptian president visited Washington last month and held 
talks in Cairo with Murphy last week However Mubarak said The 
Americans have not given us a specific peace plan 
But we have taken the position that any plan must clearly 
include first an overall settlement of the problem and second 
an international conference as a framework without any attempt to 
outflank it 
For any peace plan to succeed Mubarak said it must envisage 
the final outcome and we must stay away from any words or 
provisions that were in the Camp David agreements because they are 
outdated and finished 
He referred to an autonomy plan outlined in one of the 
USmediated 1978 Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel It 
provided for an interim arrangement under which the 15 million 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza captured by Israel in 1967 
would exercise selfrule for five years 
The plan also provided that negotiations begin not later than 
the third year of autonomy to consider the final status of the two 
territories 
Reports from Washington and Jerusalem last week said a twostage 
plan carried by Murphy suggested an accelerated version of the Camp 
David formula 
The reports said the plan proposed talks to be held under 
international sponsorship on limited Palestinian selfrule as an 
interim measure Those talks would begin in April and negotiations 
on the final status of the two territories would be held in 
December the reports said 
After his 90minute meeting with Mubarak Rifai said that Jordan 
opposed partial solutions or projects for selfrule in the West 
Bank and Gaza Jordan wants a final settlement through an 
international conference he added 
The stateowned Middle East News Agency reported that Rifai 
carried a message to Mubarak from King Hussein Rifai did not 
comment on any message 
The Washington reports suggested that Shultzs tour will be to 
sell the twostage plan to Arab and Israeli leaders 
Mubaraks remarks on Monday appeared to reflect serious 
reservations about the reported plan 
Shultz is coming and if he is bringing proposals to offer to 
the parties concerned I hope they will keep away from Camp David 
and will cover a final solution he said 
He said an international conference would give all parties 
confidence 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel opposes an international 
conference contending it would pressure Israel into making 
territorial concessions 
If a peace plan does not seek a final settlement through an 
internatiuonal conference Mubarak said the consequences will 
not be good 
I do not wish for any initiative to fail I wish for an 
initiative that aims for a final solution establishing just peace 
in the region 
Rifai reiterated Jordans demand for a United Nationssponsored 
international conference with the participation of the Security 
Councils five permanent members and all concerned parties 
including the Palestine Liberation Organization 
We are against any plan dealing with partial solutions or 
projects for selfrule We seek a final settlement Our 
assessment of any initiative will depend on how close it comes to 
the position I have stated 
Since Palestinian demonstrations against Israeli rule broke out 
Dec 8 more than 50 Arabs have died of Israeli gunfire
