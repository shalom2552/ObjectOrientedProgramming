President Reagan said today he wants to 
rescue Lt Col William R Higgins abducted while working for 
the United Nations in Lebanon but officials said the president was 
referring to a multinational diplomatic effort 
Reagan was queried during a photo session on the budget with 
congressional leaders about US efforts to find Higgins 
Were doing everything we can Reagan responded Were 
trying to find out as much as we can Were trying to get him 
located and certainly we want to rescue him 
Asked what such a rescue would entail State Department 
spokesman Charles E Redman said I think the president is making 
a reference there to all of our efforts to stay in touch with 
parties in the region with the United Nations to explore every 
possibility to see if Colonel Higgins can be safely returned 
There has been no mention by officials at the State Department 
Pentagon or White House of any US military action to rescue 
Higgins Instead officials repeatedly have emphasized that Higgins 
is under UN authority and control 
Redman denied assertions by the group claiming responsiblity for 
Higgins abduction that the Marine officer worked for the Central 
Intelligence Agency The spokesman said the group the Islamic 
Revolutionary Brigade was not known to US authorities 
House Minority Leader Robert Michel RIll also played down 
Reagans remark about a rescue I think that was maybe just an 
offthecuff remark of the president said Michel who was 
present when Reagan said it 
Michel said he always has been supportive of UN operations 
but that his advice would be for American servicemen would be to 
keep out of Lebanon 
The Reagan administration reaffirmed in strong terms its 
determination to continue supplying American soldiers for the 
United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization not just in the 
Middle East but in Lebanon 
We dont intend to let terrorists determine our policies or 
deter us from fulfilling our duties Redman said 
Its an important mission its one weve been at for a long 
time its one that we share with a large number of other 
nations Redman said 
He declined however to say if any new instructions would be 
sent to the remaining Americans 
Higgins was seized on Wednesday while traveling in South Lebanon 
on official business as a member of the UNTSO He and a number of 
other Americans the State Department said less than 20 are 
members of the UNTSO team assigned to keep the truce along the 
IsraeliLebanese border 
Since 1949 other UNTSO teams observe peacekeeping efforts along 
Israels borders with Syria Jordan and Egypt as well as Lebanon 
Higgins abduction brings to nine the number of Americans seized 
in recent years in Lebanon 
Redman drew a distinction between American civilians who have 
been ordered out of Lebanon and US troops assigned to the 
United Nations peacekeeping efforts 
Since the wave of kidnappings began the State Department has 
been warning Americans to stay out of the country Last year after 
three more Americans were seized use of a US passport to travel 
to Lebanon was banned 
In this particular case the individual US officer was under 
the responsibility authority and control of the United Nations in 
his role as a member of the United Nations Supervisory 
Organization Redman said 
Redman said he did not know if any special instructions were 
given to the US personnel in light of the dangers but added 
as I say these people are not under our operational control at 
all 
Another State Department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the practice of the American military people 
observing the IsraeliLebanese frontier was to stay at the border 
but one US soldier Higgins in this particular case was 
permitted to travel further northward 
This is not the case of a lone American straying off into a 
place he wasnt supposed to be said one official He was 
assigned to a task he was doing his job There are a lot of people 
from many countries on these observer teams and its dangerous for 
all of them 
The official said three UNTSO members none of them American 
have been killed in Lebanon since 1982
