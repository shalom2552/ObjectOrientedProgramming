Were paid for our anonymity said Landon Parvis one of the 
busiest ghostwriters around Its almost like a doctorpatient 
relationship 
Never was that confidentiality more strictly obeyed than in the 
presidential demise of Sen Joseph Biden of Delaware His writers 
said nothing Asking them was like asking a team of surgeons which 
one killed the patient 
I made some mistakes Biden said without further explanation 
of the mysterious osmosis by which the same words images and 
family memories traveled incognito from Neil Kinnock who wanted to 
be prime minister of Great Britain to Joe Biden who wanted to be 
president of the United States 
Safire now a New York Times columnist and reigning scholar on 
speechmanship thinks Biden may have suffered selfhynosis in the 
wearying blur of the campaign and began to believe that Kinnocks 
thoughts were his thoughts 
Safire points out that he and other presidential writers over 
the years have borrowed speech patterns and rhythms from each other 
without attribution He does concede that Bidens loan was a case 
of heavy lifting 
Sen William Proxmire of Wisconsin asked what difference does it 
make anyway Most candidates and many politicians use speech 
writers Is it more moral to buy a speech and claim it as your own 
than to steal it 
In the flurry of charge and countercharge only Al Haig 
appeared safely immune among the candidates Who would think to 
accuse him of literary theft this squarejawed warrior who fires 
his crossbow at the State Department for Cheshirecatting who 
rises fearlessly against bureaucratic amoking and is ready to 
caveat that or context this 
Abe Lincoln the president who delivered the greatest speeches 
wrote his own Of the two best orators of their time Franklin 
Roosevelt used a phalanx of ghosts and envied Winston Churchill for 
being able to write his own 
George Washingtons three helpers went on to become presidents 
themselves No presidential writer since has done quite as well 
although Judson Welliver now enjoys something of a revival more 
than 60 years after his time There is now a Judson Welliver 
Society of former White House writers 
Who you may well ask was Judson Welliver Hes the fellow who 
went to work for Warren Harding as a literary clerk and became 
the first fulltime presidential ghost in history He also wrote 
for Calvin Coolidge To no avail Alice Longworth still thought of 
Coolidge as someone weaned on a pickle 
Speech writers are torn by a conflict of code and ego They 
readily tell you that as a result of getting to know their man his 
ideas tastes and speech patterns the text they finally give him 
is basically his 
This is their answer to Lippman The words may be theirs the 
thinking is the clients Also says Robert Shrum who writes for 
Rep Richard Gephardt the American people would scarcely approve 
of their busy president consuming three days to write a speech 
But the hired hands also yearn for a statute of limitations on 
the law of silence so that students of history will know who wrote 
what A writer and his words are not soon parted At Nixons first 
inaugural Safire found himself wandering around the edge of the 
crowd silently mouthing his lines as the president spoke them 
Embarrassed he moved on and there was Buchanan mouthing his lines 
All agree it would be difficult to write for someone they 
disliked In this respect the busiest is the most ecumenical 
Landon Parvin writes for Ronald Reagan Nancy Reagan corporate 
heads other Republicans AND some Democrats who suit his ideology 
but wouldnt care to have that public 
Last year Parvins work for Reagan ran the gamut from the 
solemnity of major speeches on IranContra and AIDS to scores of 
oneliners on the order of Its true hard work never killed 
anybody but I figure why take the chance 
Washington is a city that consumes humor almost as fast as 
taxes Candidates officeholders lobbyists and rising bureaucrats 
hunger for it The Kennedys have been known to call a comic off the 
floor of a Las Vegas nightclub for a quick fix for the Gridiron and 
other local festivals 
Mark Shields columnist and occasional supplier notes changes 
in the humor market 
Were not nearly as ethnic There are no Pedro Pat or Manny 
stories being told The one group you can make fun of is the WASPS 
You can do Quiche is their idea of soul food or They tailgated 
during the war of 1812 There is no Episcopalian AntiDefamation 
League 
There is a legend among speech writers which they doubt is true 
but they tell it with a relish that suggests their own Walter Mitty 
dreams 
It concerns an intense president who could be sweetly benign or 
thunderously abusive After two years of that one writer snapped 
And so 
The president was rushing out to the Rose Garden for a routine 
appearance He scooped up the speech cards handed him by the writer 
and without reading them first the Leader of the Western World 
sallied forth 
There are those who say we cant fulfill the Great Society 
program and fight the war in Vietnam at the same time Theyre 
wrong and Im going to tell you why There are those who say we 
cant feed the hungry at home and also lift living standards around 
the world They are wrong and Im going to tell you why 
Two more such refrains and Lyndon Baines Johnson was now ready 
to tell them why Then he turned to the last card and found only 
this Now youre on your own
