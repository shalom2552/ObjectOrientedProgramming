A ferry being readied to carry 
Palestinian deportees on a PLOsponsored protest voyage to Israel 
was damaged by an explosion Monday that was believed set off by a 
limpet mine 
A man claiming to speak for the Jewish Defense League said the 
USbased extremist group was responsible for blasting the 
6151ton Sol Phryne at Limassol its home port on Cyprus southern 
coast 
A senior PLO official interviewed in Nicosia said It was an 
underwater blast caused by a mine that was stuck probably by 
frogmen onto the vessel It was attached to a time fuse 
Asked what the Palestine Liberation Organization planned to do 
now the official speaking on condition of anonymity said We 
are waiting for a decision by the command We have to see if there 
is an alternative ship for the voyage 
The JDL is responsible for the bombing at Limassol said an 
anonymous caller This is only a warning Next time we will bomb 
it with all the people on it 
He telephoned his statement to The Associated Press in Nicosia 
He said no comment when asked if the JDL also was behind the 
Sunday carbombing that killed three PLO officials in Limassol 
The three Mohammed Sultan Mohammed Buheis and Marwan Kayyali 
were involved in negotiations to charter the vessel for the 
voyage Cypriot security sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
The JDL advocates use of violence in the ArabIsraeli conflict 
It was founded in the early 1960s by New Yorkborn Meir Kahane now 
a member of Israels Parliament and head of extremist antiArab 
Kach Party 
There was no way to verify the callers identity 
The head of the Jewish Defense League Irv Rubin told The 
Associated Press in a telephone interview from Los Angeles 
Whoever did this righteous action we dont know him or her 
personally Its a great honor they gave us the credit but it 
belongs to people much more courageous than the Jewish Defense 
League 
A group that belonged to the original JDL the Jewish Defense 
Organization said in a statement issued Monday in New York The 
JDO claims no direct involvement in this righteous attack but 
supports it 100 percent 
In Athens Bassam Abu Sharif the PLOs chief spokesman who has 
been overseeing preparations for the muchdelayed voyage insisted 
the Ship of Return will sail 
We are continuing our plans and we will sail in spite of 
Israeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas noble 
ideas he said 
Fouad alBittar the PLO diplomatic representative in Athens 
said the damage to the 40yearold ferryboat is not very 
severe He said a hole 21 inches wide was ripped in the hull 
In Algiers a senior aide to PLO chief Yasser Arafat said the 
organization will get another craft for the voyage Salah Khalaf 
better known as Abu Iyad also said Zionist terrorism disabled 
the Sol Phryne 
The PLO had tried to launch the voyage from Greece but it was 
repeatedly delayed reportedly under Israeli pressure 
The 130 deportees plus hundreds of international supporters and 
journalists were taken in buses to Athens airport Monday and were 
told they would be flown to Cyprus to board the boat 
After news of the blast reached Athens most returned to their 
hotels 
Sol Phrynes captain Cleanthis Vlahopoulos said his vessel 
would not be fit to sail for several months 
The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the 
Exodus in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned 
back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to Palestine 
The trip is designed to focus condemnation of Israels policy of 
deporting Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
seized from Jordan and Egypt in 1967 
The deportees included taxi drivers laborers a university 
professo an Anglican bishop several mayors and city council 
members 
The voyage was supposed to end in Haifa but Israeli officials 
have said they will refuse to let the vessel enter their waters 
Limassol Port manager John Ghighis told the AP There will be 
an underwater survey to find out exactly what happened how big 
a hole there is and what repairs may be necessary 
Israel radio quoted political sources in Jerusalem as saying the 
PLO itself set off the explosion because it realized it could not 
succeed in its mission to reach Israeli shores
