US soldiers and diplomats will face leaner 
times next year under what President Reagan today called an 
essential minumum program for national security 
The trilliondollar budget Reagan sent to Capitol Hill today 
will require the Pentagon to thin ranks and scrap some weapons 
like the Midgetman missile now under development and 16 frigates 
already at sea The State Department may be forced to close some 
overseas missions but those have not been announced yet 
The budget calls for a 294 billion ceiling for military 
outlays up from 1988 outlays of 2854 billion but the increase 
is less than half the estimated 43 percent inflation rise this 
year 
State Department spending is proposed to rise 2 percent above 
1988 levels to 174 billion But a weaker dollar and inflation 
abroad have raised the costs of diplomacy meaning the government 
may lay off personnel as some foreign outposts are shut 
The proposals for national security contained in this budget 
represent an essential minimum program for keeping America safe and 
honoring our commitments to our friends and allies Reagan said 
in a statement 
Anything less would jeopardize not only our national security 
and that of our friends and allies but also would dim the 
prospects for further negotiated agreements with our adversaries 
Reagan said 
The budget plans stand in sharp contrast to the military buildup 
of the first two years of the Reagan administration when defense 
spending increased by 12 percent and 13 percent 
Reagan repeated his assertion that a mightier military 
strengthened his hand in diplomacy as well 
Weapons systems have been modernized and upgraded We are 
recruiting and retaining higher caliber personnel The readiness 
training and morale of our troops have been improved 
significantly since the beginning of the Reagan administration in 
1981 the president said 
Because we are stronger enormous progress has been achieved 
in arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union he said 
Austerity in the proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning 
next Oct 1 is forcing the Pentagon to plan on reducing the number 
of men and women under arms by 34000 to a force level of 
2172000 according to the budget Reserve strength will remain at 
17 million 
The Air Force will bear the brunt of the personnel cuts losing 
23000 airmen with the Army losing 8600 soldiers the Marines 
2900 
The Pentagon will drum out an additional 10000 civilians from a 
worldwide staff of 1102000 according to the documents 
The cuts are expected to save 14 billion in personnel costs 
More personnel savings could be realized if Congress torpedoes a 
planned 43 percent pay increase 
Americas nuclear muscle may sag some Pentagon planners want to 
cancel development of the singlewarhead mobile Midgetman missile 
But many in Congress prefer deploying the Midgetman to devising a 
way to move the MX missile by rail as a means of reducing Soviet 
ability to hit it in a first strike 
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci is expected to ask for between 
100 million and 200 million to keep the Midgetman just barely 
alive Air Force generals argue they can save more than 2 billion 
next year and 39 billion in the future by canceling the Midgetman 
according to administration officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
The Pentagon also is expected to save 786 million by canceling 
its antisatellite missile program Congress already has banned 
tests of the device for three years 
The Navys hopes for a 600ship fleet may be pushed beyond the 
horizon as that service readies mothballs for 10 frigates of the 
Garcia class and six frigates of the Brooke class built in the 
early 1970s Sailors from those ships will go to other vessels 
saving the Navy from personnel cuts except for the Marine Corps 
On the diplomatic front the State Department may be headed back 
to the straits it faced last September when a revenue shortfall of 
60 million prompted Secretary of State George P Shultz to 
forecast the elimination of 1270 jobs and the closing of more than 
a dozen embassies and consulates abroad 
Congress gave the State Department an extra 60 million for the 
current year
