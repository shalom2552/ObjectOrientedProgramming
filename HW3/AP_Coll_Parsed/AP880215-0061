Communist Laos and proWestern Thailand 
say they are fighting a border war to win a remote jungle area they 
consider sacred 
But the conflict that began in November appears to reflect 
deeper tensions fueled by centuries of enmity and more recent 
quarrels related to the flight of refugees guerrilla warfare and 
smugglers quarrels 
The periodic confrontations on the 1000mile frontier are 
smaller than the battles being fought on the ThaiCambodian border 
between Chinasupplied Cambodian guerrillas and Sovietbacked 
Vietnamese 
Still there has been no lack of drama and violence at Thailand 
border with Laos More than 300000 refugees have fled into 
Thailand including thousands of Hmong tribesmen who once fought 
for the United States 
In 1984 Thailand and Laos fought on land and in the United 
Nations over three border villages Shootouts along the Mekong 
River which forms much of the boundary line are common 
In the most recent trouble which began in November and has been 
steadily escalating the two sides accuse each other of trying to 
grab a sparsely populated area astride Thailands Phitsanulok 
province and Sayaboury province in Laos The Laotians claim 50 
square miles of disputed territory 
Several hundred troops on both sides have been reported killed 
and wounded in the fighting the largest such engagement since the 
Laotian communists seized power 12 years ago 
Artillery barrages infantry attacks and the downing of at least 
one Thai warplane by a Soviet surfacetoair missile have been 
described in official accounts by the two countries 
Today Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda announced that a Laotian 
military team would arrive in Bangkok on Tuesday for talks on 
ending the border battles But he played down expectations for a 
solution 
Since the 1975 communist takeover in Laos both sides have taken 
some steps toward peaceful coexistence 
In 1979 they pledged to turn the Mekong into a river of 
genuine peace But the poorly demarcated river and land boundary 
is itself a key source of friction Both countries pull out 
conflicting maps some dating back to the early 1900s to prove 
their claims to disputed territory 
Mutual suspicions are heightened by the activities of 
anticommunist Laotian guerrillas 
The Vientiane government claims they operate from Thai soil 
drawing recruits from among the 75000 refugees still in camps near 
the frontier In turn Laos provided support for Thailands now 
impotent communist insurgency 
Lucrative twoway smuggling of items such as water buffalo 
marijuana and consumer goods also have led to disputes that 
escalated into armed clashes 
Although Thailand denies Laotian accusations that the ongoing 
fighting was sparked by illegal log poaching by senior Thai army 
officers cases of corrupt dealings invovling Thai or Laotian 
officials have surfaced in the past 
In legal trade landlocked Laos has tried to decrease its once 
nearly total dependence on the Thais for the transit of imports and 
exports by opening up transport routes to ports in Vietnam But a 
quarter of all official imports still pass through Thailand which 
prohibits passage of 61 strategic goods including bicycles 
some medicines and building material 
The list was reduced from more than 200 items a year ago 
MacAllister Brown a US political scientist wrote recently 
Thailand controls three instruments that can seriously hamper 
the development of Laos the reception of refugees and economic 
migrants from Laos the tolerance of and cooperation with armed 
resistance elements and the ban on transit to Laos of strategic 
goods 
Although the two countries are very similar in language culture 
and ethnic origin the Laotians have been controlled by the Thais 
and the Vietnamese from the 15th century until France colonized 
the area in the late 19th century 
Vientiane a royal capital was brutally sacked by the Thais in 
1827 
For nearly eight centuries the Thai authorities continuously 
pursued an expansionist and hegemonist policy carried out tens of 
atrocious aggressive wars said a Laotian government position 
paper published in 1984 
In recent decades Thailand has grown into an economically 
strong nation of 53 million while colonial repression war and 
mismanagement by the communists has relegated Laos with barely 
four million people into the ranks of the worlds poorest 
countries 
These differences tend to increase Laotians resentment at being 
depicted by the Thais as their little brothers
