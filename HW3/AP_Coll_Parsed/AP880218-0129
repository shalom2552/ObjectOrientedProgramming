Three Soviet satellites designed to test space 
navigation equipment failed to reach proper orbit and burned up in 
the atmosphere Tass said Thursday 
Tass said Cosmos 1917 1918 and 1919 were launched Wednesday 
but on Thursday entered dense layers of the atmosphere and ceased 
their existence 
The booster rocket placed the separation unit holding the 
satellites on an interim orbit but the system then malfunctioned 
and the satellites fell from orbit Tass said 
In August Tass announced that a 10ton satellite had failed to 
reach orbit The report apparently was the first time Soviets 
announced beforehand that one of its satellites was dropping from 
orbit 
That satellite fell into the ocean without causing any damage or 
injuries
