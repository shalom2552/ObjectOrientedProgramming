Georgetown University which has waged a 
thusfar unsuccessful legal battle to avoid supporting homosexual 
groups on campus has agreed to treat such organizations the same 
as it does other student groups 
The university agreed Friday to give homosexual student groups 
equal treatment A District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruling 
late last year had said the university must offer homosexual 
organizations the same tangible benefits given other student 
groups although it did not have to officially recognize them 
The university had said that treating homosexual organizations 
on campus with equality would violate its conscience as a Roman 
Catholic institution Church teachings do not support homosexual 
acts 
Georgetowns announcement Friday came one day after the DC 
Office of Human Rights said it would launch a major 
investigation into the universitys treatment of homosexual 
groups after three students complained that it had not fully 
complied with a court ruling 
University spokesman Gary Krull said its action had nothing to 
do with the Human Rights Office investigation and the decision 
was made before the university learned of the probe 
Krull also said the decision does not prejudice our ability to 
file a formal request for the US Supreme Court to review the 
case Last month the high court twice rejected Georgetowns 
request to stay the appeals court ruling 
Krull said Georgetown would give gay organizations on its law 
school and main campus the same things it offers to any group 
and would not restrict its assistance to four items specifically 
mentioned by the appeals court a mailbox computerized label 
service mailing services and an opportunity to apply for 
university funds 
Law school Dean Robert Pitofsky said the broader list of 
services and facilities that will be available to the Lesbian and 
Gay Association of Georgetown University Law Students includes 
photocopying telephones stationery meeting and party rooms and 
offices
