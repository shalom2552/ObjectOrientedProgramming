Irving Bank Corp on Tuesday rejected the 
current 108 billion buyout offer from Bank of New York Co and 
launched another sharp verbal attack against its unwanted suitor 
Irvings board of directors rejected as significantly 
inadequate Bank of New Yorks offer to pay 15 in cash and 1575 
shares of its own stock for each of Ie Bank of New York dipped 12 cents 
to 2975 a 
share giving its offer an indicated value of nearly 62 a share 
Bank of New Yorks latest offer is its second revised proposal 
since the bank holding company initially offered to pay 80 in cash 
and securities for Irving last September Bank of New York revised 
the offer to 68 in cash and securities following Octobers stock 
market crash and lowered the offer a second time late last month 
Irving bitterly has rejected all three overtures in the rare 
hostile bank takeover attempt and maintained it wanted to remain 
independent 
The new proposal is even worse for Irving shareholders than 
earlier BNY proposals stated Joseph A Rice Irvings chairman 
The revised offer continues to promise a deal in which Irving 
shareholders are grossly uncercompensated while assuming very 
substantial risk 
We deeply regret that BNY persists in its illconceived 
efforts he said 
Owen Brady a Bank of New York spokesman said the company 
regretted Irvings rejection but would continue seeking a meeting 
to discuss a merger He reiterated Bank of New Yorks stance that 
it reserved the right to revise its offer when warranted 
Irving also announced that its board increased the regular 
quarterly dividend on its common stock to 60 cents per share from 
56 cents per share The dividend is payable March 31 to 
shareholders of record on March 1
