Three Eastern European countries have begun 
talks with the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft companies to 
supply longrange passenger planes to replace aging Soviet 
equipment in their national airlines Deputy Secretary of State 
John C Whitehead said Friday 
Whitehead just back from a twoweek trip to four Sovietbloc 
countries told reporters my impression is they are very much 
interested in buying US planes Its a significant thing 
psychologically I believe Eastern European countries flying US 
planes 
He declined to identify the countries that expressed interest 
but another official speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
were Poland Hungary and Romania 
If deals are arranged it would be the first US aircraft sales 
to Hungary and Poland 
In the early 1970s Romania purchased several Boeing 707 
passenger jets under a contract arranged at a time when the United 
States was wooing Romania in hopes of increasing that countrys 
independence from Moscow 
Whitehead said that from the State Departments viewpoint it 
would be feasible and desirable for the sales but he noted two 
major stumbling blocks 
Buying US aircraft would require large expenditures by the 
governments and credits from the US ExportImport Bank for the 
purchases would not be available Whitehead said 
The aircraft companies moreover would be prohibited from 
selling equipment on a list of militaryapplicable goods banned for 
export to communist countries This could limit the type of 
airplanes the countries could buy 
There is some navigational equipment that could not be on the 
planes Whitehead said They would have to buy stuff that would 
not be on the embargo list 
Whitehead the No 2 official in the State Department has 
assumed special responsibility for a US effort to gain influence 
in countries that have been dominated by the Soviet Union since 
World War II 
Under the policy the United States has offered the nations 
increased trade and better relations in general in return for 
improved human rights performance and the institution of free 
economic policies On his latest trip Whitehead visited Poland 
Romania Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia 
Whitehead said he told Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu that 
his country is in danger of losing special trading rights granted 
by Congress each year to reward Romania for its relatively free 
emigration policies 
The trading rights mostfavorednation status have been 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Romania in previous years 
but renewal for 1988 has been suspended by Congress because the 
Ceausescu governments human rights policies are considered 
repressive especially toward religious minorities 
Whitehead said he told the Romanian leader there was only a 
5050 chance it would be renewed but there was still time 
Ceausescu in keeping with previous discussions with US 
officials refused to discuss the human rights issues on grounds 
they were strictly an internal matter Whitehead said 
I came home with not much reason to hope there will be 
improvement he said
