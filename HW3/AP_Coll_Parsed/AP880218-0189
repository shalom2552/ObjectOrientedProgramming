Here are excerpts from the text of Thursdays 
address to the Communist Party Central Committee by Soviet leader 
Mikhail S Gorbachev as translated into English by Tass the 
official Soviet news agency 
Education 
There is absolutely no doubt that everything that concerns 
school education and upbringing is directly linked to the 
development of socialism to perestroika Moreover it is its major 
direction 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
The teacher is a major protagonist of perestroika Should he 
support us with conviction sense and passion perestroika will 
gain many new sincere advocates and fighters successors to the 
revolutionary socialist cause 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
He must be relieved of petty patronage suspicion towards his 
pursuits and findings must be lifted He should be relieved of 
duties other than teaching his time and strengyh must be released 
for the main thing 
All obstacles and barriers in the way of innovation in 
pedagogics must be removed decent material conditions must be 
created for the teachers creative endeavor

Socialism and past mistakes 
Over 70 years our party and people have been inspired by the 
ideas of socialism and have been building it But because of 
external and internal causes we have been unable to fully realize 
the Leninist principles of the new social system 
This was seriously hampered by the cult of personality the 
system of management by command and administration that formed in 
the thirties bureaucratic dogmatic and voluntarist aberration 
arbitrariness and late in the seventies early in the eighties 
lack of initiative and hindrances that have led to stagnation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
These phenomena and what has remained of them and come down to 
the present should become things of the past 
In this lies the answer to those who express their doubt if we 
are not retreating from socialism from its foundations laid down 
by generations of Soviet people 
No we do not retreat if only a step from socialism from 
MarxismLeninism from everything that has been gained and created 
by the people But we decisively reject dogmatic bureaucratic and 
voluntarist legacy as it has nothing in common either with 
MarxismLeninsim or with genuine socialism 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
Free competition of minds is needed Our social thinking stands 
to gain from this Its prognosticating capacity will be enhanced 
and hence its ability to serve as a reliable basis for working 
out the partys policy will increase

Nationalities 
True internationalism true friendship of peoples are possible 
only if there is deep respect for dignity honor culture language 
and history of every people extensive relations among them We 
ought to facilitate in all ways the further broadening of contacts 
between national cultures their mutual enrichment their 
development and flourishing 
Soviet patriotism is the greatest of our values any 
manifestations of nationalism and chauvinism are incompatible with 
it Nationalism in any form is blind attempts at selfisolation 
lead only to a spiritual blind alley The knowledge and 
understanding of the scope grandeur and human specifics of 
socialist revolution the struggle of the party and the people 
full of truth and heroic spirit and defense of socialist 
motherland feed the roots of Soviet patriotism Here we approach a 
very important issue unification through revolution and Soviet 
power of national honor and national heritage of every people and 
internationalism of socialist society 
In short we should set to thoroughly tackle nationalities policy 
at the present stage in all areas including theory and practice 
This is the most fundamental vital issue of our society I think 
that one of the plenums of the central committee should be devoted 
to problems of nationalities policy

Politics 
We should firmly pursue the line of reinforcing the legal levers 
of perestroika first of all to prevent the law on state 
enterprises and other legal instruments for economic reform from 
being diluted with all manner of departmental instructions and 
directives 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
The main problem in developing our political system is to create 
a mechanism of power and government with precisely regulated 
effective democratic control and corresponding legal procedures 
which would drastically diminish and even reduce to naught the 
element of chance in handling major political state issues and 
preclude the possibility of subjectivity at all floors of our 
political system 
It is necessary to achieve that decisions of principled 
importance be worked out and adopted with the peoples active 
participation This will correspond to our socialist democracy 
Priority should be given to cardinally changing the role of the 
soviets governing councils as the core of the political system of 
our society and its embodiment in state bodies 
It is in the way the soviets are formed and function that the 
democratic principles of socialism must be realized in the first 
place 
In a sense we are talking today about the need to revive the 
Soviet system of government in Lenins interpretation We should 
make the soviets at all levels agencies of state authority and 
administration that will be really working demonstrating 
initiative and enjoying full rights 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
We should take account in the soviets of the entire diversity of 
our country including national features 
And of course we should not bypass the Supreme Soviet of the 
USSR We are to rethink its role so as to increase the 
effectiveness of its activites starting from the presidium and 
fullscale parliamentary sessions and ending with the work of the 
commissions and individual deputies 
The key issue of reform in the political system concerns 
delimiting the functions of party and state bodies
