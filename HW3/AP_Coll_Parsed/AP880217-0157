The president and four other officials 
of an engineering firm have resigned in the wake of allegations 
that one of the executives improperly tried to influence a federal 
safety agency 
The allegations stem from a letter written in December by Fred 
W Graham Rust Engineering Cos manager of safety and security 
to an official of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration in which Graham offered to testify favorably about 
the agency before a congressional committee 
In return Graham wrote he sought OSHAs agreement to 
reasonable penalties against Rust Engineering based in 
Birmingham Ala for safety violations at Bridgeports 
garbagetoenergy plant 
Graham was one of the five who resigned Tuesday said company 
spokeswoman Sherry Cook 
Rust is building the 200 million plant in Bridgeport Last 
week OSHA proposed 54000 in penalties against the company for 
alleged safety violations at the site 
Cook confirmed that the resignations were the result of a letter 
written by Graham to OSHA in December She said company President 
Joseph de la Campa had reviewed and approved Grahams letter before 
it was sent to OSHA 
Earlier this month the company retracted the letter and said it 
was unauthorized Cook on Tuesday reaffirmed that statement saying 
that the letter had been unauthorized despite de la Campas 
approval 
Rust officials said in a statement The actions taken sending 
the letter to OSHA were not in keeping with the high professional 
standards of the company 
The Department of Labors inspector generals office and the 
Connecticut US attorneys office are investigating whether Rust 
officials sought to improperly influence OSHA 
Also resigning Tuesday were Nicholas Bouler an attorney Ronald 
Luster manager of construction and LG Wright Rust 
Engineerings Bridgeport project manager
