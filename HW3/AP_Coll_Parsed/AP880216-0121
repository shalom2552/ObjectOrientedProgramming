If you have an urge to send somebody a message in 
a bottle Edna Hulbert can give you some hints She started 
throwing bottles in bodies of water 66 years ago when she was 17 
Shes received replies from people in France England and Spain 
and even played matchmaker to a French couple getting married in 
June 
It doesnt cost any money and Im hearing from people I never 
knew There was no end to the fun Ive had said Mrs Hulbert 83 
Although she doesnt drink Mrs Hulbert prefers liquor bottles 
because they float best She used to pour her late husbands Scotch 
into empty mustard and ketchup jars so she could have the empties 
She tossed her first message into the Mississippi near St Louis 
and has since lobbed bottles into the Hudson River the Thames in 
England the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas a Montana lake and 
the canals of Amsterdam 
She doesnt recommend lakes They dont go very far They go 
in a circle 
Over the years about 30 people have responded many of them 
young men looking for a girlfriend A French man and woman who 
lived in towns about 100 miles apart each found one of her bottles 
Mrs Hulbert told the girl about it 
She wrote to him and he wrote to her and now theyre going to 
get married I was thrilled to hear that says Mrs Hulbert who 
has been invited to the wedding 
Bottle messaging like life is not all fun and games A bottle 
that went into the Fox River near Oshkosh Wis brought a citation 
for littering from the local police 
I ignored it she says

The long and winding road to fame began 
and ended here for Rex the wandering raccoon hound 
Three weeks ago he was just an ordinary stray roaming Route 30 
This week hes sharing the cover of People magazine with comedian 
Robin Williams 
Rex disappeared from Arthur and Emilie Thomas yard in April 
1985 He was missing for 2 years until he was picked up last month 
by animal control officer Cathy Barrows 
Rex made the Dog of the Week column in a local weekly and 
the Thomases reclaimed him That story made the Brattleboro 
Reformer then spread across the nation 
Since his return the Thomases have been swamped with calls and 
letters and some of Rexs lost years are being filled in 
A man in Bennington 40 miles west of Brattleboro said he found 
Rex after he saw a van with New Jersey plates dump the hound on the 
road 
The man already had three dogs and could not take another in so 
Rex was given to friends Where Rex went next is not known and the 
trail to fame fades until it reappears in Brattleboro
