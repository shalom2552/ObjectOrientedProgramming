The Gannett Foundation announced 21 grants 
Tuesday totaling 135 million in its Literacy Challenge a program 
aimed at spurring the growth of adult literacy services 
The aim of the Literacy Challenge is to stimulate statelevel 
activity among adultliteracy groups and agencies The foundation 
says it is the largest nongovernment source of funds for such 
cooperative efforts 
The Rochester NY foundation with assets of more than 600 
million has committed a total of more than 5 million to adult 
literacy projects since 1985 It has spent 25 million on the 
Literacy Challenge alone 
Nine awards went to new proposals and 12 were renewals in the 
programs second and final year 
Gannett Foundation President Eugene C Dorsey said From the 
quality of the new proposals and the success so far of the renewal 
projects we believe these states have taken major steps toward 
providing adult nonreaders with coordinated effective 
opportunities to learn to read

millions more struggle with the printed word
