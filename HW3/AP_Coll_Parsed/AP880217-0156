West Germanys main opposition party 
pressured the government Wednesday to follow Moscows lead and 
scrap some nuclear missiles before a USSoviet missile treaty 
goes into effect 
Hermann Scheer disarmament expert for the opposition Social 
Democrats said Chancellor Helmut Kohl should respond to the early 
Soviet missile reductions by dismantling West Germanys 72 Pershing 
1A missiles 
Such a reaction would be equal to developing trust in 
disarmament which the leadership in East Berlin has been working 
toward with the Soviets Scheer speaking on behalf of the party 
told reporters 
East Germanys staterun news agency ADN reported Tuesday that 
the Soviet Union had dismantled SS12 nuclear missiles in Waren an 
East German site about 90 miles northwest of Berlin 
The SS12s are included in a USSoviet agreement to eliminate 
the superpowers medium and shorterrange missiles 
Kohl announced before the superpower pact was signed that West 
Germany would scrap its Pershing 1A missiles as part of a new 
treaty The Pershing 1A missiles are owned by West Germany but the 
United States controls the rockets nuclear warheads 
On Wednesday East German newspapers printed photos of 
dismantled missiles and hailed the Soviet preparations for removing 
the SS12s before the treaty is ratified 
Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from East 
Germany the Communist partys official newspaper New Germany 
said in a banner headline 
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev signed 
the treaty in Washington last December The agreement stipulates 
that the Soviets shorterrange missiles in East Germany and in 
Czechoslovakia are to be removed within 18 months and mediumrange 
US and Soviet missiles within three years 
Three Senate committees are debating the treaty and ratification 
may come during the summer The Supreme Soviet the Soviet Unions 
parliament is expected to approve the accord 
In Washington the State Department had no immediate reaction to 
the report But a US official who demanded anonymity said the 
Soviets were free to remove their missiles before the treaty takes 
effect 
The official said US inspectors will go to East Germany and 
all other Soviet missile sites to verify compliance with the treaty 
if it is ratified 
ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when 
they would be returned to the Soviet Union only that Soviet 
soldiers are making the last preparations to return their SS12 
rockets 
With this step we can make an important contribution toward 
disarmament even before the treaty between the United States and 
the Soviet Union is ratified ADN wrote 
East German leader Erich Honecker said in January that Soviet 
intermediaterange rockets based in his country could be removed 
ahead of schedule but at the time gave no specific timetable 
According to figures released after the treaty was signed 22 
rockets 12 launchers nine transport vehicles and seven practice 
missiles were stationed at Waren which has the largest numbers of 
SS12s in East Germany There are three other SS12 sites in the 
country 
The Soviet Union also has shorterrange SS23 nuclear missiles 
based in East Germany
