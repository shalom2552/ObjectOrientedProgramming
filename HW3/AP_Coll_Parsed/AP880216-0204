Like the easygoing downhome characters they 
portray in their television commercials sausage kings Jimmy Dean 
and Jerry Owens dont give the impression they are fighting whole 
hog for the fattest share of the market 
It seems mostly a gentlemans competition for leadership in the 
breakfast sausage market between the two Dallasbased companies 
whose officials praise each others products as high quality 
Jimmy Dean Meat Co ranks first nationally while the regionally 
distributed Owens Country Sausage leads in Texas according to both 
companies most recent AC Nielsen Co market share figures that 
exclude link and microwave sausage 
Each claims to be the leader in the Southwest region although 
they decline to release those figures 
Were tough competitors but theres plenty of room says 
former entertainer Jimmy Dean who heads his company of the same 
name 
They are formidable competitors We continually go at it tooth 
and nail with each other says Jerry Owens chairman of the 
venerable 60yearold Owens Country Sausage 
Both Jimmy Dean and Jerry Owens personally pitch their products 
on TV The two Texans speak with an easy drawl about home and 
family and hearty breakfasts 
Deans celebrity status came almost 30 years ago when his Big 
Bad John countrywestern song hit the charts He also hosted a 
television variety show 
His answer on how he got into the sausage business is his 
standard one even in a telephone interview from his boat the 
Big Bad John floating somewhere south of Miami where Dean is 
wintering 
Had you ever seen my act you would realize diversification 
was imperative I was in the hog business in Plainview and the 
market fell out and we were losing out Quality sausage was 
something I didnt think existed said Dean a remark sure to 
leave the Owens people aghast 
Dean founded the company with his brother Don in 1969 But the 
brothers waged a nineyear legal battle when Jimmy Dean made 
critical remarks about his brothers management of the company in 
the 1970s Don Dean is no longer with the company 
In 1986 Jimmy Dean was ordered by a Dallas jury to pay Don 
500000 in damages for violating a 1980 agreement to keep quiet 
about his brother A federal appeals court overturned that last 
year 
Family relationships at Owens have been smoother 
Owens attained his reputation selling sausage as his father 
CB Owens did before him But from his appearance and manner 
Owens could easily pass for a countrywestern star himself 
Our emphasis is on our familys involvement with the company 
on a daytoday basis and the family heritage and a history of 
reliability and consistency he said sporting a westerncut 
corduroy jacket plaid shirt and thin gold chain around his neck 
Jerry Owens son Stewart is now president of the company 
Jerry Owens said it never really occurred to him to do anything 
but take over the family business which started back in 1938 with 
the idea of using ham loin and shoulder cuts in sausage instead 
of using it to get rid of the trimmings 
Pork sausage was an abused product Owens explained 
While both companies are headquartered here both are now owned 
by bigger outofstate corporations that allow them to continue to 
market their products under their own brand names 
While Dean is distributed nationally Owens is marketed from 
Arizona to Mississippi and as far north as Oklahoma and Arkansas 
In 1984 Jimmy Dean Meat Co was acquired by Chicagobased Sara 
Lee Corp which also owns other smaller sausage companies Owens 
was acquired by Bob Evans Farms Inc of Columbus Ohio in 1987 
I think thats a big enough market that both are highly 
regarded in their respective areas I dont sense that either one 
is out to murder the other said Elliott Schlang senior vice 
president of Prescott Ball amp Turben an investment firm in 
Cleveland 
He called the Bob EvansOwens merger a very nice geographic 
expansion though its too early to tell if it will be successful 
While their advertising harks back to home cookin and simpler 
times both sausage companies also are venturing into more 
modernday markets with biscuits and microwave foods that are 
quick and easy to serve 
Convenience is the deal today Owens said Lifestyles are 
kind of changing with more working moms Breakfast in many 
households has become getting a bite on the run 
His latest TV commercials show Owens hawking a sausage biscuit 
that can be heated in the microwave oven 
Likewise the Jimmy Dean company is pushing English muffins 
topped with ham and cheese or sausage Dean said the company will 
soon be testmarketing a small packaged hamburger but declined to 
give more details 
Mesquitesmoked sausage is being marketed in the Dallas area 
while microwaveable sausage is being tested in several markets 
said Ed Jenkins vice president for marketing at Jimmy Dean 
The Owens family also plans to get into the restaurant business 
relying on the expertise of Bob Evans successful chain in the 
Midwest to help get a new restaurant in Irving Texas off the 
ground in March
