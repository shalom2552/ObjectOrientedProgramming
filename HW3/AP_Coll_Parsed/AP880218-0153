The nations industrial operating rate was 
unchanged in January at 822 percent of capacity as cutbacks in the 
production of steel and autos offset gains in other areas the 
government reported Thursday 
The January operating rate remained at the highest level in 
almost eight years but it was the first month since September that 
the operating rate had failed to move up 
Many private economists believe the economy which moved ahead 
at a robust pace during the second half of 1987 has entered a 
signficant slowdown brought on by high backlogs of unsold products 
which will cause cutbacks in production 
While some believe the slowdown will be so severe that the 
country will enter a recession most analysts are forecasting weak 
growth but no recession in the first half of 1988 followed by 
rising economic activity for the rest of the year 
David Wyss an economist for Data Resources Inc said he 
expected the overall economy as measured by the gross national 
product to rise a miniscule 14 percent this year down sharply 
from the 38 percent growth recorded in 1987 with the weakness 
coming from production cutbacks brought on by sluggish consumer 
demand 
By contrast the Reagan administration in releasing its 1989 
budget Thursday forecast economic growth of 24 percent for this 
year 
In January the operating rate in the auto industry dropped by 
12 percentage points to 767 percent of capacity It was the third 
consecutive monthly decline after auto plants hit an operating rate 
of 82 percent in October The report blamed excessive 
inventories on dealers lots for the production cutbacks 
Steel and other makers of primary metals a sector closely tied 
to the auto industry also saw a drop in operating rates which 
fell to 896 percent of capacity last month down from 912 percent 
in December 
Analysts said they looked for this trend to continue and spread 
to other industries as retailers caught with high inventories 
slash orders 
The January operating rate of 822 percent was a full 3 
percentage points above the operating level 12 months ago 
reflecting the boom the manufacturing sector has enjoyed from 
rising export sales 
The administration is counting on the strength from recordhigh 
export levels to offset weakness in the consumer sector and keep 
the economy out of a recession this year 
For all of manufacturing the operating rate was unchanged at 
824 percent of capacity in January Manufacturers of durable 
goods items expected to last at least three years operated at 
799 percent of capacity a small decline from December while 
manufacturers of nondurable goods operated at 861 percent of 
capacity 
The industry with the highest operating rate is paper where 
plants are operating at 965 percent of capacity followed close 
behind by textiles with an operating rate of 941 percent of 
capacity 
Normally when operating rates get above 85 percent economists 
begin to worry about bottlenecks and rising prices But analysts 
said that the expected slowdown in growth should help to constrain 
prices this year 
If I werent expecting a slowdown I would be more worried 
about inflation Wyss said 
The mining industry which has been hardhit by declines in oil 
prices had a 03 percentage point drop in the operating rate to 
802 percent of capacity in January 
This was offset however by a 09 percentage point increase in 
the operating rate at utility companies which rose to 816 percent 
in January The big gain was attributed to unusually severe winter 
weather which boosted heating demands
