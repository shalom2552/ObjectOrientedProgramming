The defense in the sedition trial of 14 
men linked with white supremacist groups told a federal jury that a 
key witness for the governments case is a liar who had himself 
crowned king of the Ozarks 
The charge came during opening statements Wednesday in which the 
prosecutor said that leaders of white supremacist groups gathered 
in 1983 to discuss poisoning the water supplies of New York and 
Washington DC and establishing an Aryan nation 
Louis Ray Beam Jr 41 of Houston a defendant who is 
representing himself told the US District Court jury to expect 
a fairy tale of lies from the man he called the prosecutions 
star witness James B Ellison 
Ellison who is serving a 20year prison term for racketeering 
and weapons offenses was leader of an Arkansasbased group named 
The Covenant the Sword and the Arm of the Lord 
Wayland Parker attorney for defendant Lambert Miller said 
Ellison once went off into the woods fasted and came out declaring 
that God had told him he was king of the Ozarks 
This would be foolishness if they werent trying to put 
innocent men in jail Beam said urging jurors to look for signs 
of untruthfulness when Ellison testifies 
Beam is among 10 men charged with conspiring to overthrow the 
government by force starting at a 1983 meeting attended by Beam 
Ellison and others Beam said he never met Ellison until that 
meeting and knows nothing of any conspiracy 
Its a good story but thats all it is Beam said 
Ardie McBrearty 60 of Gentry Ark another of the 10 charged 
with conspiring to overthrow the government by force echoed Beams 
statement in his own statement today 
By golly Hans Christian Andersen couldnt have done any 
better in making up a story he said The governments tale he 
said consists of a little truth here a little truth there and 
a whole lot of imagination in between 
He said he received about 100000 from the founder of a white 
supremacist extremist group named The Order but returned more than 
90000 after I began to sniff that these werent tax fighters at 
all 
He said he has long opposed some federal tax laws and procedures 
and had contact with some white supremacists only because they were 
introduced to him as tax protestors 
Conspiracy to overthrow the government has a maximum penalty of 
20 years in prison 
Miller and four others are charged with conspiring to murder a 
judge and an FBI agent who played a part in the prosecution of 
people who harbored a man wanted in North Dakota for the slayings 
of two US marshals The maximum penalty for that charge is life 
imprisonment 
One man Richard Wayne Snell is charged with in both incidents 
The government and five of the defendants made their opening 
statements Wednesday the second day of a trial expected to last 
three months 
Assistant US Attorney Steve Snyder said in his statement that 
Ellison talked about the poisoning scheme in 1983 at an Aryan 
Nations convocation in Hayden Lake Idaho with Richard G Butler 
and Robert Miles Snyder said 
Butler 69 is the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ 
Christian Aryan Nations while Miles 63 is a former Ku Klux 
Klan official convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school 
buses in Pontiac Mich 
At the time Ellison had more than 200 pounds of sodium cyanide 
in his possession Snyder said 
At that same conclave supremacist leaders discussed the idea of 
abolishing the US government and setting up an Aryan state 
Snyder said 
He said Ellison sent a paper around to be signed and when 
it came back signed by the leaders Ellison said All of us today 
entered into a conspiracy against the government of the United 
States 
The meeting ended with the Nazi stiffarm hail victory 
salute Snyder said 
Butler Miles and Beam disputed this account Butler said 
Ellison is trying to shorten his prison stay by saying anything 
the government wants him to say 
Snyder said the supremacists viewed white people as the people 
of God Jews as the spawn of Satan blacks were called 
mudpeople and were regarded as subhuman and the government was 
called ZOG for Zionist Occupation Government
