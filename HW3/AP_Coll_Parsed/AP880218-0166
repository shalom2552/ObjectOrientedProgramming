A state task force has endorsed a 
sugar growers proposal to build an experimental marsh in a cane 
field to study ways to protect the Everglades from agricultural 
drainage 
The Lake Okeechobee Technical Advisory Council agreed Wednesday 
to encourage the state to develop such plans but suggested that a 
larger test site might be needed in the fields of SN Knight and 
Sons 
We think its a good idea and a good approach said Archie 
Grant council chairman 
Knight offered to build four miniature swamps for the experiment 
if the state would extend the growers lease on 3700 acres of 
stateowned land in western Palm Beach County 
The action came as the council completed its 50page interim 
report to the Legislature on environmental problems created by 
diverting polluted water away from Lake Okeechobee 
Much of the report focuses on problems in the sprawling sugar 
canegrowing region the 700000acre Everglades Agricultural Area 
The agricultural drainage is damaging the Everglades marshes in 
western Palm Beach and Broward counties and could pose a longterm 
threat to local water supplies scientists have said 
Council member Garrett Sloan MetroDades utilities director 
said the outcome of the experiments would be very important for 
protecting coastal communities water supply 
If we can enjoy success with the research into biological 
vegetative methods of nutrient removal we will all be very happy 
along the lower East Coast Sloan said 
The council recommended a series of experimental projects to 
test the ability of artificial marshes to absorb excess nutrients 
from farm drainage It also recommended steps be taken to reduce 
nutrients discharged by lakefront communities sewage treatment 
plants and supported any improved farming practices to reduce 
agricultural discharges 
The panels recommendations go directly to the state 
Legislature but will not require much legislative action Most of 
the efforts can be carried out by the South Florida Water 
Management District without legislative authorization
