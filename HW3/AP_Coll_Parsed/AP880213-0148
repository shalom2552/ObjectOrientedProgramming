Organizers of a muchdelayed voyage to 
Israel by Palestinian deportees said they chartered a new vessel 
Saturday and would leave Monday but some European politicians 
dropped plans to go along 
Really we are going on Monday said Hanna Nasser a member 
of a committee for the voyage by 130 Palestinians deported by 
Israel and hundreds of journalists and observers who have gathered 
in Athens 
The journey of return is designed to focus attention on 
Israels use of deportations to punish Palestinians in the 
territories it captured in the 1967 Middle East war 
It was initially set to start Tuesday was rescheduled for 
Wednesday and then for Saturday 
PLO officials said Israeli pressure led ship owners to back out 
of charter deals Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel has 
referred to the trip as an act of war 
Early Saturday sources among the organizers said no contract 
had been signed for a ship 
But Fouad AlBittar the PLOs diplomatic representative in 
Athens said a contract to charter a vessel was signed at midday 
PLO officials refused to give details about the ship citing 
security concerns 
I have a ship name but Im not going to give it to you 
Bassam Abu Sharif chief spokesman for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat 
told reporters 
The new plan was announced at a 5 pm 10 am EST meeting set 
as a deadline by European parliamentary observers for a final word 
on the voyage 
Even so some who had planned to make the trip said they had to 
back out because of the delays 
I simply cant clear one more week on the schedule said 
Lord Christopher Mayhew of Britain 
Others expressed fears that the latest plan might fall through 
I have been told this that the boat would sail every day 
and it hasnt happened said Michael Ferris an Irish senator 
But several other observers including an Italian senator 
Raniero LaValle promised to make the voyage 
A small group of Greek and Italian leftists staged a 
demonstration outside the Israeli diplomatic mission in Athens on 
Saturday to protest alleged Israeli efforts to block the trip 
Luciano Neri a member of Italys Proletarian Democracy Party 
chained himself to the mission fence for two hours 
There were no arrests 
The trip is modeled after the voyage of the Exodus which tried 
to take Jewish refugees to Palestine in 1947 but was turned back by 
British authorities Miriam Algazi who took part in the Exodus 
voyage also planned to journey on the Palestinian ship
