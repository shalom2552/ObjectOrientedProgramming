Pope John Paul II celebrated an Ash Wednesday Mass 
in a 5th century church on Romes Aventine Hill overlooking the 
city 
During the twohour ceremony marking the beginning of Lent the 
45day period leading up to Easter the pontiff recalled the 
phrase We are ashes as he urged listeners to remember their 
mortality 
As he led a procession to the church of Saint Sabina the late 
afternoon sun unseasonably warm for midFebruary brightened the 
touches of gold in his vestments and those of accompanying clergy 
Under the muted halflight that entered the church through the 
filigreetraced windows the pontiff smudged a mixture of ash and 
holy water on the foreheads of cardinals Other clergy administered 
to the crowds of people who surged forward to receive the 
benediction 
The period of Lent observed by fasting and penitence 
commemorates Jesus fasting in the desert
