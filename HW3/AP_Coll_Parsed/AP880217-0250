Oil prices fell marginally in lethargic trading 
that dealers attributed to a lack of news and the absence of many 
market participants because of industry conferences 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange the Marchdelivery price of 
West Texas Intermediate the key US crude oil closed Tuesday at 
1667 per 42gallon barrel down 8 cents from Friday The exchange 
was closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday 
Refined products prices barely changed The Marchdelivery price 
for wholesale heating oil fell 023 cent a gallon to 4637 cents 
and the Marchdelivery price for wholesale unleaded gasoline edged 
up 001 cent a gallon to 4629 cents 
Basically Id have to say it was one of the quietest days 
this year that I can remember said Peter Beutel assistant 
manager of Elders Futures Inc a futures trading firm in New York 
Many US and European oil traders were away from the market for 
events sponsored by the International Petroleum Exchange the 
London oil futures market
