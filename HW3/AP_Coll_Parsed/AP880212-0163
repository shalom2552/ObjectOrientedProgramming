Soybean futures prices leaped as much as 10 cents a bushel 
Friday as speculators sparked a finalhour surge on the Chicago 
Board of Trade 
On other markets grain futures were mixed precious metals 
firmed energy futures retreated and stockindex futures advanced 
The soybean rally was kicked off by one large speculative firm 
which began snapping up soybean futures and options contracts late 
in the session analysts said 
During the first two and half hours of the trading session it 
was basically a liquidation market with prices easier following a 
runup during the week said Mickey Luth an analyst in Chicago 
with the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc 
Then it started rallying and rallying and ran up to new highs 
on the day he said 
The runup triggered computercontrolled buy stops and up she 
went said Victor Lespinasse a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds 
Inc 
The August contract gained 10 cents a bushel 
Luth said the buying may have been linked to rising European 
demand for soybean meal 
Corn prices retreated slightly on rumors the Agriculture 
Department plans to begin auctioning off surplus corn stocks in 
April Lespinasse said The program would supposedly be similar to 
the USDAs successful weekly wheat auctions begun in November 
which increase the supply of grain on the open market 
Wheat futures advanced in line with soybeans After the close 
the USDA announced substantial new export business including new 
sales of wheat to China Algeria and Finland 
Wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in March at 332 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 1 cents 
lower with March at 201 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cent 
higher with March at 190 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 10 
cents higher with March at 627 a bushel 
Gold and silver futures posted their best gains in more than a 
week on New Yorks Commodity Exchange in apparent defiance of 
government trade figures released Friday 
The Commerce Department reported the US trade deficit had 
narrowed to 122 billion in December compared with 132 billion 
in November The lowerthanexpected number helped strengthen the 
dollar which often leads to lower gold prices 
Instead gold futures gained more than 5 a troy ounce perhaps 
in reaction to the Labor Departments announcement that wholesale 
prices rose a brisk 04 percent in January said Craig Sloane an 
analyst in New York for Smith Barney Harris Upham amp Co 
Sloane said Thursdays government report of a 05 percent rise 
in retail sales in January also may have helped the metals markets 
which had been drifting lower on ideas the economy was slipping 
into a recession 
The increase in retail sales could suggest the economy is not 
going into recession and I think that is something the metal 
markets in general would view favorably Sloane said The last 
thing they want to hear right now is anything having to do with 
recession 
Gold settled 530 to 750 higher with the April at 44870 a 
troy ounce silver was 75 cents to 83 cents higher with March at 
639 a troy ounce 
Energy futures slumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 
mostly technical trading analysts said 
Merrill Lynch analyst John Hill said the charts continued to 
look weak and he predicted further declines on Tuesday when 
trading resumes after the holiday weekend 
Hill also said many traders were selling crudeoil contracts for 
March delivery and buying contracts for later delivery an 
indication they expect oil prices to fall in the near term 
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 34 cents 
lower with March at 1677 a barrel heating oil was 61 cent to 
79 cent lower with March at 4660 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 37 cent to 76 cent lower with March at 4628 cents 
a gallon 
Livestock and meat futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange on expectations of a surge in slaughters 
Many traders expect livestock marketings to increase next week 
as milder weather moves into the Plains and Midwest said Roger 
Norem an analyst for AgriVisor Services Inc in Bloomington Ill 
Live cattle settled 18 cent lower to 10 cent higher with 
February at 7165 cents a pound feeder cattle were 60 cent lower 
to 15 cent higher with March at 8330 cents a pound hogs were 43 
cent lower to 20 cent higher with February at 4725 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 50 cent to 78 cent lower with February
