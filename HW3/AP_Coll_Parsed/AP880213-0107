Here is the text of the Democratic radio address 
delivered Saturday by Senate Majority Leader Robert C Byrd 
DWVa 
This is Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd 1988 promises to 
bring about a massive shift in the way most of the free world sizes 
up its own security A new arms control treaty the INF treaty 
is before the Senate People in this country and in Europe are 
concerned about what it means to their future 
For that reason I led a bipartisan delegation this week to five 
NATO countries to raise some crucial questions and to pledge to 
European leaders that Americas commitment to NATO is unshakable 
unchanged and undiminished 
The signing of the INF treaty has opened the door to new 
optimism new uncertainties and new risks for NATO The treaty is 
an invitation to fashion a stronger alliance among ourselves and a 
more pragmatic strategy toward the Soviets 
We were heartened to find that NATO leaders view the new Soviet 
leadership with a healthy dose of realism 
Much of their skepticism and ours can be laid to Mr 
Gorbachevs stunning achievement in eclipsing his predecessors in 
style and message At times he seems to have almost mesmerized 
Western publics with the prospect of detente with his adversaries 
abroad and the trappings of glasnost at home 
American polls are now recording a trust toward this Russian 
leader where none existed before Yet there are some of us who are 
still nagged by questions 
Where is the evidence that a halfcentury of Soviet pursuit of 
dominance and control has been bridled 
Why should we risk deterrence on the professed good will of a 
man only three years into power Glasnost must not be confused with 
the freedom of the press or freedom of speech by Western standards 
The INF treaty is in large measure due to the courage and the 
cohesion of the West We proved that together we are the match 
for any aggressor that we are the only real foil to Soviet 
expansionism 
We know that our adversary has not abandoned its historic goals 
on the world scene So our course should be one of new initiative 
to constantly test the new Soviet leadership under Gorbachev 
The leaders we consulted this week agreed that NATO has a 
twofold task first to fashion sound solutions for our common 
defense and our common approach to a skillful protagonist second 
to persuade our peoples of the realities we face 
Our message must be clear and constant Arms control is not an 
end in itself It is a means to an end The end being a more secure 
Western alliance 
I was born at a time when Woodrow Wilson proclaimed World War I 
the war to end all wars And I was a young man when Franklin 
Roosevelt galvanized a nation with his call to arms 
A generation has come of age since America and Europe last 
fought side by side That that generation has been spared the 
trauma of war is a credit to the trust and strength we have given 
on both sides of the Atlantic 
In the coming months we must declare our unity of purpose not 
just to the Soviets but to the American people and to the people 
of Europe 
We know we are still far from a time when the world is in 
perfect balance Although nuclear deterrence is an essential 
component in the pursuit of peace NATO must soon offer a strong 
proposal on conventional and chemical weapons control 
In the end the key to peace is cohesion We must redeclare 
ourselves an alliance The Soviets must be convinced of our public 
support the depth and flexibility of our armed response and our 
staying power 
The leaders in Europe with whom we met share our concerns They 
are realistic about Mr Gorbachev and they welcomed strong American 
leadership of the NATO alliance We pledged to them our support of 
the alliance and the continued commitment of the American people to 
the common destiny of Europe and America for Europes security is 
our security
