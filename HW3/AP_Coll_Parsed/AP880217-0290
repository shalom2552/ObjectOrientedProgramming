Cotton futures prices soared the limit allowed for daily trading 
Wednesday in a technically inspired rally that lifted the market 
out of several weeks in the doldrums 
On other markets soybean futures surged while grains were 
mixed livestock and meat futures were mixed precious metals 
advanced slightly energy futures were mostly lower and 
stockindex futures retreated 
Cotton prices for delivery in March May and July all advanced 
the 2 cents a pound daily limit on the New York Cotton Exchange in 
buying that accelerated sharply when the May contract reached 6320 
cents a pound said Ernest Simon cotton specialist for the 
investment firm PrudentialBache Securities Inc 
The rally marked the largest daily movement for those contracts 
all of which are based on the 1987 crop since Jan 26 when the 
price on all three contracts fell nearly 2 cents a pound 
Simon attributed most of the buying to technical rather than 
fundamental factors 
Judy Ganes an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Inc said rumors of Soviet purchases of US cotton may also have 
contributed to the rally 
Thats it as far as fundamentals she said The markets 
just been quiet for a while and today it began to pick up 
The contract for March delivery settled at 6370 cents a pound 
Soybean prices soared near the close on the Chicago Board of 
Trade as talk circulated that ABC radio news commentator Paul 
Harvey had reported the discovery of a sudden death syndrome 
affecting soybean crops said Jerry Gidel an analyst for GH 
Miller amp Co 
Harveys Chicago office confirmed the commentator had reported 
such a finding based on a wire service report about a research 
project at the University of Illinois The Associated Press 
reported the story in 1986 
The soybean complex also was supported by expectations of new 
foreign purchases of soybean meal and soybean oil said Joel 
Karlin an analyst for Research Department Inc in Chicago 
The soybean rally spread to the neighboring grain pits pushing 
corn prices higher and bringing wheat futures off their lows of the 
day analysts said 
Wheat settled unchanged to 32 cents lower with March at 327 a 
bushel corn was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with March at 201 a 
bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at 191 a 
bushel soybeans were 11 cents to 13 cents higher with March at 
633 a bushel 
Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange after declining sharply earlier in the day in reaction to 
the Agriculture Departments monthly cattleonfeed report 
The report showed larger numbers of cattle being fattened for 
slaughter than the market had anticipated That sent futures prices 
lower in early trading but steady cash prices for livestock 
limited the losses analysts said 
Live cattle were 25 cent lower to 68 cent higher with February 
at 7180 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 85 cent 
higher with March at 8385 cents a pound hogs were 43 cent lower 
to 05 cent higher with February at 4717 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were unchanged to 28 cent lower with February at 
5570 cents a pound 
Precious metals futures advanced slightly on the Commodity 
Exchange in New York but analysts said the move did not indicate a 
change in the recent downward trend for gold and silver prices 
The dollar appears to be holding steady the balance of trade 
figure is showing improvement and that is leading to a rather weak 
investment demand outlook for gold said Stephen W Platt metals 
analyst in Chicago for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc 
Gold settled 140 to 180 higher with April at 44920 a troy 
ounce silver was 75 cents to 78 cents higher with March at 645 
a troy ounce 
Energy futures finished mostly lower on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange after starting out higher in reaction to weekly American 
Petroleum Institute figures showing sharp drawdowns in gasoline and 
distillate stocks

cents higher with March at 1661 a barrel heating oil was 39 
cent to 79 cent lower with March at 4558 cents a gallon unleaded

cents a gallon
