Slippery icecovered roads and 
snarled traffic helped four people escape from a man who abducted 
them at gunpoint and took their cars police said Friday 
Larry F Johnson 43 of Logansport Ind was arraigned on four 
counts of kidnapping in Warren District Court after his arrest in 
the cases early Friday He was being held without bond in the 
Warren County Jail police said 
He also was wanted in Georgia South Carolina Tennessee 
Indiana and Kentucky on various charges including assaulting a 
police officer in Georgia kidnapping theft and drugrelated 
charges said Trooper Jackie Strode 
Johnson was traveling on foot and was not armed when he was 
arrested Strode said 
Strode said Erwin Quirand of Knoxville Tenn and a 
17yearold girl from Sumter SC jumped from a northbound car 
Thursday on Interstate 65 while traffic was slowed past the site of 
a multivehicle cartruck pileup in which one person was killed 
They ran to police and said they had been kidnapped 
Quirand said he had been kidnapped him and his car taken 
Wednesday at a Knoxville Tenn grocery store He told WBKOTV in 
Bowling Green that his abductor said he was running for his 
life The juvenile said she and her car were taken Tuesday 
The man sped away but crashed the car four miles north of the 
accident scene Strode said 
The man then stopped a pickup truck driven by Daniel Eidson Jr 
18 of Bowling Green and asked Eidson and his passenger Greg 
Bell 21 of Richardsville for a ride to get a wrecker 
But when they pulled into a service station Eidson said the 
man pulled out a gun and said Im in a little trouble with the 
law Keep going 
The man then took the wheel but slid off an icy road into a 
ditch Eidson said 
The three walked to a house and the man tried to persuade 
someone there to give him a ride to Nashville but was turned down 
Eidson said 
He said the three then went to the home of Susan and Gary Comer 
where the man asked to borrow their tractor to pull the truck out 
of the ditch 
Mrs Comer refused Eidson said and the gunman then demanded 
her car and ripped a telephone cord out of the wall 
I told them the keys were in the car Mrs Comer said 
Her car slid off another road and Bell and Eidson escaped while 
pushing it out of a ditch Eidson said 
The gunman later wrecked that car and police lost his trail 
until running across him early Friday about six miles south of 
Bowling Green Strode said 
He had been described by Indiana authorities as suicidal and 
wanting vengeance against police officers Strode said 
Eidson said he was afraid during the incident 
I didnt really know what the man would do he said But 
he had a gun you know and he kept pulling it out
