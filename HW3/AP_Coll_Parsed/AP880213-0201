The stock market has reacted with 
uncharacteristic confusion to a drop in interest rates over the 
past several months 
A long decline in interest rates from their lofty levels at the 
start of the 1980s was widely cited as one of the primary forces 
behind the great bull market in stocks When rates surged upward 
last spring the stock market ran into trouble 
Since the crash in October interest rates have come down again 
with yields on longterm Treasury bonds falling from above 10 
percent to 84 percent as of Friday But stock traders have shown 
little enthusiasm 
Of course they have other worries on their minds Black Monday 
on Oct 19 cast a long shadow 
Beyond that however analysts say the latest drop in rates 
doesnt fit into the kind of textbook pattern that would lift 
investors spirits 
Sustained declines in interest rates often occur in recessions 
prompted by weak demand for credit As rates fall they help set 
the stage for a rebound in business activity 
This time however they have moved lower against a backdrop of 
an economic expansion that is more than five years old And many 
observers see them as an early symptom of a business slump 
There has been very little corroborating evidence for that view 
in the statistical measures of the economy so far 
US exports set a record for the second straight month in 
December attesting to a revival in manufacturing If the latest 
data on retail sales are to be believed consumers havent run out 
of spending money 
Over the last several weeks there has indeed been an 
accumulation of positive fundamentals said John Connolly an 
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc They have moved the bond 
market rather than the stock market but that still counts 
It is quite normal for the bond market to react first and in 
a sense clear out a path for the stock market 
Stocks did rally in the past week pushing the Dow Jones average 
of 30 industrials up 7278 points to 198326 
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 351 to 14486 
the American Stock Exchange market value index 689 to 27700 and 
the NASDAQ composite index for the overthecounter market 752 to 
35327 
Big Board volume averaged 17943 million shares a day against 
19213 million the week before 
Recession worries have been heightened by a run of three 
consecutive monthly declines in the governments index of leading 
economic indicators 
But Maury Harris economist at PaineWebber Inc argues that the 
declines only portend a business slowdown instead of an outright 
recession 
In the past Harris says threemonth declines in the leading 
indicators have foreshadowed recessions in cases where the Federal 
Reserve has been constrained from easing credit by other problems 
most notably inflation 
This time he maintains with inflation still subdued the trade 
deficit improving and the dollar having apparently stabilized 
the Fed will respond to signs of weakness with an easier monetary 
policy 
Just a couple of months ago the Fed and its chairman Alan 
Greenspan appeared to be caught in a dilemma The central bank 
couldnt raise interest rates without hurting the economy and it 
couldnt lower them without risking a continuing slide of the 
dollars value in foreign exchange 
Now says Connolly the Fed is in the most flexible position 
in a long time Greenspan must feel relieved
