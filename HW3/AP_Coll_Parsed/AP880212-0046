The Fish and Wildlife Service added 59 species 
to the list of endangered and threatened species last year the 
second highest total ever the service said Thursday 
In the previous most active year 1979 68 species were added 
The list now stands at 993 animals and plants of which 513 are 
found only in foreign countries the service said in a yearend 
report 
One species was removed from the list after confirmation of its 
longsuspected extinction the Amistad gambusia a small fish 
found in some springs in Texas 
Another species died out during the year but the paperwork to 
remove it from the list has not been completed spokesman David 
Klinger said This was the dusky seaside sparrow whose last 
survivor an elderly male in captivity died in Florida 
Among other reasons to call it a good year the service noted 
its reestablishment of the red wolf in the wild in North Carolina 
the growth of the Chesapeake Bay bald eagle population from 136 
pairs to 161 successful captive breeding of the blackfooted 
ferret and establishment of a second population of California sea 
otters off the coast near Los Angeles 
Too late to make the report was the successful mating of condors 
in captivity in California The service removed the last condor 
from the wild last year on Easter Sunday and hopes to rebuild the 
population through breeding in captivity 
Environmentalists have complained that under the Reagan 
administration the service has been moving far too slowly in 
making decisions and that it will take 16 years or so to work 
through the backlog of about 1000 candidate species 
They have said that in the last 20 years 300 species became 
extinct while waiting for a decision 
Listing of a species as threatened or endangered under the 1973 
Endangered Species Act means federal agencies must consult the 
service about any of their activities which could harm it Also 
the service must draft and try to carry out a recovery plan of 
which 222 are in effect
