The government is going out of 
its way to dampen expectations for rapid change in contrast to 
past years when hints of political breakthroughs proved wrong 
The pressures of unrest and sanctions are waning white 
officials say and there is time to crack down on pockets of 
opposition while trying to persuade blacks to accept less than 
majority rule 
In the week since the 1988 Parliament session opened President 
PW Botha and his Cabinet have sought to turn the spotlight away 
from black grievances and focus it on a new economic program that 
advocates a publicsector wage freeze and privatization of state 
monopolies 
During a string of speeches by Cabinet ministers scant mention 
was made of the persistent grassroots struggle by blacks for 
political rights 
Instead there were generalized endorsements of democracy 
coupled with explanations that it could be extended to blacks only 
in a slow circumscribed manner that would leave whites with a 
final say on national policy 
Reform cannot take place at the same rate as one can brew 
instant coffee said Stoffel van der Merwe a deputy minister 
assigned by Botha to woo black leaders into negotiations The 
capacity for people to digest change is limited 
Compared with the hardline apartheid rhetoric of a decade ago 
the current talk of sharing power with blacks borders on the 
revolutionary 
But the government also has clarified its nonnegotiable bottom 
line continuation of segregated schools hospitals and living 
areas and a political system in which whites could never be 
dominated by blacks 
The nations blacks number 26 million and their population 
growth rate is nearly triple that of the 5 million whites 
The political model we will develop is not intended to seek 
the approval of the outside world said one government official 
speaking on condition of anonymity We cant have a political 
dispensation based simply on majority rule 
Antiapartheid activists already have dismissed as inadequate 
one of the few pending pieces of reform legislation a proposal to 
allow communities the option of integrating subject to approval by 
residents and the government 
Most of the official talk about reform is now presented in terms 
of the new economic program which proponents say will free large 
sums of capital for projects benefiting blacks 
Reform Costs Money has become an unofficial government 
slogan with the implication that economic progress must precede a 
major political shift 
Botha in fullpage newspaper advertisements Sunday called on 
South Africans to tighten our belts to build the economic 
foundation for social and political change 
But Sampie Terreblanche a leading economist who last year quit 
Bothas National Party suggested in a column in the nationally 
circulated Sunday Times that the economy was being stressed to 
detract attention from the tragic failure of the governments 
political reform 
Extremeright politicians have condemned the economic plan as a 
disguised attempt to redistribute wealth from whites to blacks 
The governments new approach contrasts with periods in the past 
three years when at least some officials indicated dramatic 
political moves were imminent 
There were suggestions that Nelson Mandela jailed leader of the 
African National Congress might be freed and that the government 
might negotiate with the outlawed guerrilla movement 
Particularly embarrassing was Bothas highly promoted 1985 
speech in which he said South Africa was crossing the Rubicon 
away from apartheid then disappointed people who expected 
specific momentous concessions 
Now government officials believe the ANCs military strength is 
waning and claim to have triumphed over the international sanctions 
campaign 
The white liberal opposition is in disarray and antigovernment 
unrest in black townships is down sharply after 20 months of 
stateofemergency detentions and security force patrols 
There is breathing space the government believes to 
concentrate on longterm plans and confront the challenge by the 
extremeright Conservative Party in three upcoming parliamentary 
byelections 
Gerrit Viljoen minister for black education and development 
told foreign journalists that the best way to counter the farright 
threat is to promote orderly effective reform 
But the government also is preparing an array of tough moves 
against its political foes on the left moves which could boost 
its standing on the right The targets include 
Militant black trade unions Pending legislation would make it 
harder for unions to stage legal strikes and easier for employers 
to fire strikers 
Universities State subsidies are being sharply reduced this 
year and further cuts are threatened unless university officials 
crack down on antigovernment campus protests 
The press Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha defended 
regulations that have subjected antigovernment newspapers to 
threat of closure and he criticized mainstream Englishlanguage 
papers for a venomous vendetta against his censorship rules 
Antiapartheid organizations Officials indicate that 
legislation is being drafted that would prohibit the receipt of 
foreign funds by certain antigovernment groups a move that could 
devastate those whose supporters within South Africa are mostly 
poor 
If one gets large amounts of money which is channeled from 
overseas into the South African political process then one gets 
too many foreign shareholders said van der Merwe If people 
want to be active on the South African political front they must 
do so with money they raise in South Africa
