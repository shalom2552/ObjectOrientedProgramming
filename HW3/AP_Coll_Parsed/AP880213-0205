Cattle futures traders have developed the jitters on indications 
that the threemonth bull market may be coming to an end and a 
report due out on Tuesday may seem to support that notion 
But a look at the big picture shows how deceptive the numbers 
can be an analyst says 
The Agriculture Departments monthly cattleonfeed report for 
the seven largest cattleproducing states is widely expected to 
show a modest reduction in both the number of cattle slaughtered 
and the number placed on feedlots in January compared with the same 
month a year ago 
Taken at face value a reduction in those figures would seem 
positive for cattle prices because it apparently would indicate 
tightening supplies 
The problem is that supplies should not be declining at least 
not in the near term 
The number of cattle placed on feedlots for fattening back in 
August and September was higher than the placements figure a year 
earlier said Chuck Levitt an analyst in Chicago for Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Inc 
Those animals would normally have begun reaching acceptable 
slaughter weights in January which should logically be reflected 
by a higher January marketings figure in Tuesdays USDA report 
Levitt said 
Instead analysts who track the daily flow of cattle from 
feedlot to market expect the January marketings figure to be 
anywhere from 1 percent to 7 percent below the January 1987 figure 
Thats creating some nervousness within the industry that 
maybe theyre falling behind in marketings which would mean a 
larger carryover of cattle from January to February of this year 
Levitt said 
An increasing backlog of cattle destined for slaughter would 
have a negative influence on prices especially in these days of 
consumer concern over the fat and cholesterol content of red meat 
Beef products already face stiff competition from poultry and fish 
which are lower in cholesterol and an increase in beef supplies 
would likely drive prices lower 
Those fears surfaced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange this 
past week in three straight days of declining cattle futures prices 
after two days of fairly sharp gains 
But Levitt said the Monday and Tuesday advances tell the real 
story of the markets eventual direction 
The sharp surge on Monday and followthrough buying on Tuesday 
were reactions to the USDAs semiannual cattle inventory report 
which was released the previous Friday 
That report showed the nations cattle herd had shrunk for the 
sixth consecutive year and that the number of calves under 500 
pounds those that could be fattened for slaughter later this year 
was down 10 percent from a year earlier 
Feedlots are jammed now as producers attempt to take advantage 
of current high prices but the decline in calf numbers eventually 
will become the dominant factor in the market Levitt predicted 
The number of cattle out there that are not yet on feedlots 
is getting smaller and smaller he said 
Were supporting larger feeder inventories now but thats not 
going to last forever Levitt said Halfway through this year 
our onfeed number will be lower than a year ago And thats why 
were so bullish
