Democrat Bruce Babbitt and Republican Pete du Pont dropped out 
of the presidential race today both declaring their futile 
campaigns the opportunity of a lifetime while most of the 
surviving contenders marched south for a campaign blitz leading up 
to Super Tuesdays primary trophy 
Meanwhile Republican party regulars in Nevada were bracing for 
Pat Robertsons invisible army as they geared up for a 
nonbinding straw poll tonight And Democrats were set for 
backtoback debates starting tonight in Texas the biggest Super 
Tuesday state 
Babbitt and du Pont became the first postNew Hampshire 
casualties 
Today our campaign lowers its flag but our crusade continues 
to march du Pont said in his hometown of Wilmington Del 
In America we do not promise that everyone wins only that 
everyone has the opportunity to try You have given me the 
opportunity You listened considered and chose I could not 
have asked for more said du Pont heir to the chemicalcompany 
fortune 
Both du Pont former governor of Delaware and Babbitt former 
governor of Arizona said they would not endorse another candidate 
for now 
Appearing at a news conference in Washington Babbitt said he 
was reminded of the biblical saying The truth shall set you 
free In his case he said the truth his poor showings in Iowa 
and New Hampshire came a lot sooner than I expected 
Still he said Today I am free 
Although I am withdrawing from this race I am not withdrawing 
from the cause that brought me to it he said I dont know why 
we fared no better Ill leave that for others to ponder But I am 
very proud of what we did achieve and I am honored beyond measure 
by the opportunity I was granted to take part in this campaign 
Babbitt who formally announced his candidacy on March 10 1987 
failed to set the electorate afire with his call for a national 
sales tax to combat the federal deficit but received good press 
reviews for his candor and wry humor 
He said today a friend had told him Bruce you fought a good 
fight You were in it right up to the beginning 
Gary Hart who finished last among Democrats in New Hampshire 
headed home to Denver where he said his campaign would continue 
but not for reasons of ego and ambition 
Financially strapped Paul Simon who placed second in Iowa and 
third in New Hampshire backed off his declaration that he must win 
contests next week in South Dakota or Minnesota to stay in the race 
for the Democratic presidential nomination 
He told reporters at a series of fundraisers late Wednesday 
Were now hedging on that because of the reaction weve been 
getting from around the country 
Du Pont entered the Republican race on Sept 16 1986 and 
along with Rep Jack Kemp of New York sought to present himself as 
the conservative alternative to frontrunners Bob Dole and George 
Bush 
Bush who was campaigning in Missouri today brushed aside 
complaints from Dole that he had misrepresented the Kansas 
senators positions on taxes an oilimport fee and arms control in 
a flood of commercials just before Tuesdays New Hampshire primary 
Im not going to dwell on it the vice president said I 
dont want to be drawn into something like that Keep it on a high 
plane 
Dole who beat Bush in Iowa and had hoped to deliver the 
knockout punch in New Hampshire promised to hit back if attacked 
again Which he was by Rep Jack Kemp campaigning in Minnesota 
who hit Doles record on taxes and Social Security 
The Democrats New Hampshire victor Michael Dukakis hotfooted 
it South and took quick aim at Tennessean Albert Gore who has 
hinged his campaign on a strong showing on March 8 when all the 
Southern states but one hold primaries or caucuses 
Theres a mythology about the South as if its some kind of 
foreign country Its nonsense said Dukakis who picked up 
endorsements Wednesday from former Kentucky Gov Martha Layne 
Collins and former New Orleans Mayor Dutch Morial 
Told that Gore had said his opponents were alienated from the 
voters the Massachusetts governor retorted Mr Gore left Iowa 
virtually left New Hampshire I dont know whos alienated 
Rep Richard Gephardt who finished second in New Hampshire was 
campaigning in South Dakota which holds a beauty contest 
primary on Tuesday in which voters state a preference that does not 
commit convention delegates 
Gephardt strategists said he wanted to head into Super Tuesday 
with a recent win under his belt The Missouri congressman also was 
campaigning in Wyoming which holds caucuses March 5 with 13 
delegates at stake 
Jesse Jackson who made respectable showings in Iowa and New 
Hampshire was back in the South on a swing through Florida Texas 
and Alabama In Mobile he stood with paper workers locked out in a 
contract dispute sounding his campaign call for economic justice 
The Democrats were gathering in Dallas for the first of two 
debates On Friday they move on to St Paul Minn 
Robertson in Florida threatened to reignite the controversy he 
kicked off at a GOP debate Sunday when he asserted that there are 
Soviet missiles in Cuba a claim the White House quickly denied 
In my opinion they are there the former television 
evangelist said as he campaigned in Lake Buena Vista on Wednesday 
Robertson had acknowledged after first making the claim that he 
had no direct evidence to back it up 
In Nevada where Republicans were holding a straw poll tonight 
GOP state chairwoman Sally VitkusMcKinney said she had heard 
reports that backers of Robertson would try to pack the caucuses 
Followers of the former television evangelist have flummoxed GOP 
regulars in several states with massive organizing drives 
Steve Wark Nevada coordinator for Robertson said his 
organizing efforts were no different than those of coordinators for 
other candidates
