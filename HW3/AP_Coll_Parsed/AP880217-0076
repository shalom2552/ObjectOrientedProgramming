US Secretary of State George P Shultzs 
forthcoming Middle East tour will fail to advance ArabIsraeli 
peace efforts because of Washingtons flirtation with Israel a 
leading columnist said today 
Moussa Sabry also blamed American influence and Zionist 
Israeli terrorism for wrecking a plan by the Palestine 
Liberation Organization to send a ship on a protest voyage from 
Nicosia to Israel this week 
Shultz is to make the regional tour late this month to discuss a 
reported US peace plan 
The blueprint according to reports from Washington and 
Jerusalem calls for an international forum to launch ArabIsraeli 
talks in April on interim Palestinian selfrule in the 
Israelioccupied West Bank and Gaza Negotiations on a final 
settlement for the two territories would open in December 
The plan was reported to have been outlined in a recent area 
tour by Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy 
I am not convinced that the US administration under Ronald 
Reagan will move effectively as a partner in the peace process 
Sabry wrote Its all very well to make tours of capitals in the 
area Its all very well for Murphy or Shultz to come to the 
region But these trips will bring no results 
Sabry one of a group of Egyptian journalists known to be close 
to President Hosni Mubarak was writing in his periodic column on 
the front page of the stateowned newspaper AlAkhbar He often is 
critical of Israel but his comments about the United States were 
harsher than usual 
Citing next Novembers US presidential election he wrote 
This is the year when Democratic and Republican candidates vie 
for the Jewish vote This is when the flirtation with Israel heats 
up I even venture the belief that the object of the US 
administrations flirtation is Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir the leader of extremism 
Sabry appeared to imply that Washington prefers Shamir to his 
moderate coalition cabinet partner Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
whose Labor Party favors territorial concessions to the Arabs 
On the PLO ship Sabry said American influence and Zionist 
terrorism that tried to destroy the vessel were the reason why 
the planned protest voyage to Israel has been stalled 
The PLO charged that Israeli agents planted a mine that blew a 
hole and crippled the Cypriot ferry Sol Phryne on Monday as it was 
being readied to carry Palestinian deportees international 
observers and reporters to Israel 
Israel vowed to prevent the ship from entering its waters
