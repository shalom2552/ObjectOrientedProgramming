Iran said Sunday its forces fired on US 
Navy helicopters flying ahead of a convoy of USflagged Kuwaiti 
ships in the Persian Gulf The Pentagon said it had no evidence 
that the attack happened 
An Iranian naval commander speaking in an interview reported by 
staterun Tehran radio said the incident occurred Friday evening 
The attack would have happened about the same time an Iraqi 
warplane fired two cruise missiles at Irans Sirri island that came 
within eight miles of the convoy 
The commander whose name was not given said US 
reconnaissance helicopters were fired upon as they operated over 
the islands of Sirri and neighboring Abu Musa and the oil platforms 
of Salman and Nasr 
Navy pool reporters who were with the convoy that night said 
US helicopters were aloft about the time that Iran said it fired 
on the aircraft and that the sound of antiaircraft guns was 
detected from Sirri after the Iraqi missile exploded there 
But they also said that the exchanges happened within a span of 
about 20 minutes and it was unclear whether the Iranians were 
firing at the US helicopters or in reaction to the Iraqi raid 
The Iranian naval commander said Iranian troops fired warning 
shots and issued radio warnings to the helicopters then opened 
direct fire after the warnings went unheeded driving the US 
helicopters away 
A Pentagon spokesman Air Force Maj Randall Morger said Sunday 
that US officials had heard the reports but at this point in 
time we just have no reports to indicate that anything like that 
occurred 
The convoy completed its journey Sunday when it arrived in 
international waters off Kuwait the US Central Command in 
Tampa Fla said in a statement 
The convoy escorted by the cruiser USS Chandler and the frigate 
Reuben James formed Thursday in the Gulf of Oman The Navy began 
escorting 11 USflagged Kuwaiti tankers in July to protect them 
from Iran which considers Kuwait an ally of Iraq 
It was the Chandler crew that reported that Iraqi missiles came 
within eight miles of it on FridayAlthough the convoy apparently 
was not the intended target the Chandler fired flares to warn the 
Sovietbuilt Badger bomber to change course after which one of the 
projectiles passed close to the American ships officers said 
The disclosure that Iraq had used C601 missiles the airfired 
version of the Silkworms that Iran deploys on the ground has led 
gulf shipping executives to believe that that was the same type of 
missile that struck the Danish supertanker Kate Maersk the night 
before 
The tanker was towed Sunday to a port outside the gulf A Danish 
seaman was killed in the attack and three others were wounded 
During their 7yearold gulf war Iraq has attacked Iranian oil 
tankers while Iran has retaliated by attacking neutral ships in the 
gulf
