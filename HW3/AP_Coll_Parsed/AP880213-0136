Republican presidential candiate Pat 
Robertson has canceled interviews and ducked questions when asked 
to back up anecdotes hes told including one about a woman who 
caught AIDS by kissing her impotent husband a newspaper reported 
Saturday 
The Concord Monitor said the former television evangelist also 
has failed to document assertions he knows a little girl in 
Pittsburgh whose reading level soared from second to seventh grade 
in 20 days under a moneysaving program to improve reading skills 
The newspaper said it has asked Robertson and his staff for 
documentation but details have not been produced and interviews 
have been canceled 
The newspaper said it asked for details after an AIDS expert 
concerned with Robertsons remarks said acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome is spread through sex blood or needles and mother to 
infant 
Robertson said Saturday the story about the woman catching AIDS 
was a news story gathered by our news department 
It was strictly off the wire reports but was gathered when we 
did a series on my television program dealing with this subject 
Robertson said 
Robertsons staff has not identified the girl whom the candidate 
has cited as an example of an inexpensive method of improving 
childrens reading skills the Monitor said 
All of the stories are verifiable Robertson said We gave 
them the names of who to check Every one of them is true 
Three weeks ago the Monitor asked for documentation of the 
AIDS case the account of the little girl and two other anecdotes 
Robertson has used in interviews the newspaper said 
Aides offered names of people they believed could substantiate 
two of the anecdotes at best their comments offered partial 
support In the other two instances the staff provided no 
documentation and people contacted by the Monitor said the stories 
were unlikely 
Initially staff members said they would respond to the 
Monitors request for documentation Last week they recommended 
asking Robertson himself Campaign aides arranged two interviews 
this week both were canceled 
Stopped in an elevator in the Statehouse on Thursday 
Robertson said I havent got time for that really Thats 
background 
Robertson missed a third interview by telephone arranged by 
his staff for later Thursday night the newspaper said 
The newspaper said that Friday Marc Nuttle Robertsons 
campaign manager said the examples were taken from segments of the 
700 Club a program on Robertsons Christian Broadcasting Network 
but he did not know how producers who worked on the stories could 
be reached 
Regarding AIDS by a kiss the Monitor quoted Robertson at from a 
December news conference I know one man who was impotent who 
gave AIDS to his wife and the only thing they did was kiss 
In an earlier interview with the Monitor Robertson said that 
if a person is in a room with 25 people with AIDS and theyre 
breathing various things into the atmosphere the chance of 
somebody catching it has become quite strong the newspaper 
said 
The Monitor said Scott Hatch a spokesman for Robertson said 
that information was taken from a British medical report which 
he said he sent to the Monitor by overnight mail about a week ago 
It did not arrive
