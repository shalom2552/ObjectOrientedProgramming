Three major opposition politicians were 
arrested Tuesday in an apparent attempt to quiet antigovernment 
forces before the March 3 parliamentary elections 
The arrests came one day after opposition parties criticized 
President Hussain Muhammad Ershads plan to use army troops to 
provide security for the elections which are being boycotted by a 
coalition of 21 antigovernment groups 
Ershad said he would deploy troops at voting places after more 
than 100 people were killed last week during village council 
elections Most of the deaths were blamed on clashes between 
supporters of rival candidates 
Sajeda Chowdhury secretary of the Awami League and retired 
Cols Akbar Hossain and Oli Ahmed leaders in the Bangladesh 
Nationalist Party were arrested at their homes in the early hours 
Tuesday representatives of both parties said 
Awami League official Najma Rahman said Mrs Chowdhury had just 
returned from an Awami League meeting when she was taken to Dhakas 
central jail 
Ashraf Hussein a Nationalist Party official said government 
agents also carried out raids early Tuesday on the residences of 
other party leaders but did not find them home 
The government made no announcement of the arrests following 
the pattern set when the oppositions main leaders Sheik Hasina of 
the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the Nationalist Party were 
arrested before previous elections 
Mrs Zia and Sheik Hasina were put under house arrest for a 
month after their parties led a campaign beginning in November to 
demand Ershads ouster 
Under emergency laws declared just after the antiErshad 
campaign began police can arrest and detain people without charge 
or trial for an indefinite period More than 30 people have been 
killed in violence connected to the opposition campaign 
The Awami League and Nationalist party blamed Ershad for failing 
to control last weeks election violence But on Monday they also 
condemned his plan to employ the army for security 
The army is a sacred institution meant for safeguarding the 
countrys independence and sovereignty Mrs Zia said in a 
newspaper interview published Tuesday They should not be dragged 
into politics 
The Awami League issued a statement saying The government is 
playing with fire The decision must be withdrawn 
A source in the ruling Jatiya Party said Monday that Ershads 
decision followed an appeal from leaders of parties participating 
in the polls He spoke on condition of anonymity 
Ershad a 58yearold former army general seized power in a 
bloodless coup in 1982 and was elected president in 1986 The 
opposition condemned that election as rigged and said no fair vote 
can be taken with Ershad in power 
The president dissolved Parliament on Dec 6 and called for 
elections to try to placate the opposition but the major parties 
agreed on a boycott Ershads Jatiya Party an alliance of 73 minor 
parties and dozens of independents are running
