The United States resumption of chemical weapons 
production sabotaged talks on banning the arms Foreign Minister 
Eduard A Shevardnadze charged Monday 
British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told Shevardnadze 
the West will not settle for a Soviet advantage in mobile nuclear 
missiles or conventional or chemical arms 
The West wants to see more evidence of Soviet leader Mikhail S 
Gorbachevs new thinking in foreign policy said Howe who 
arrived Sunday for a brief visit He is to meet with Gorbachev on 
Tuesday 
We in the West will be happier with the USSR when we can 
point to concrete evidence that new thinking does in practice make 
the Soviet Union an easier neighbor Howe said at a luncheon 
Shevardnadze held in his honor on Monday A text of his remarks was 
made available to The Associated Press 
The Soviet foreign minister urged a ban on chemical weapons 
saying they are the only weapon of mass destruction which is most 
probably intended for use in the area from the Atlantic to the 
Urals 
Last December the United States began producing binary chemical 
weapons which produce a toxin by combining two relatively harmless 
agents following an 18year moratorium on production of chemical 
weapons 
Talks on a worldwide ban on chemical weapons were close to 
concluding with an agreement before the US decision to begin 
producing binary weapons Shevardnadze said 
The binary sabotage and it cannot be described in any other 
way may push us to a new spiral of the chemical arms race 
said Shevardnadze according to the Tass news agency 
Binary weapons in our judgment precisely mark the boundary 
line between the interests of the United States and its European 
allies Not an imaginary boundary but the one inherent in the 
capabilities of these weapons and their delivery vehicles 
Shevardnadze said 
In his speech Howe said Western Europeans are deeply concerned 
about their security now that the United States and Soviet Union 
have agreed to eliminate intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
They see Soviet pressure for a nuclearfree Europe which in 
reality means a nuclearfree Western Europe with our Eastern 
neighbors still in possession of a large mobile nuclear arsenal in 
addition to your preponderance in conventional and chemical 
weapons the British foreign secretary said 
Howe dismissed what he called any artificial linkage between 
a USSoviet agreement to cut strategic weapons and the US 
Star Wars program 
Disputes over President Reagans plan for a spacebased shield 
against nuclear attack still stand in the way of an agreement to 
cut both sides arsenals of longrange nuclear missiles by 50 
percent 
US Secretary of State George P Shultz will be discussing that 
issue with Soviet leaders after he arrives in Moscow on Sunday 
Howe ruled out any negotiation with the Soviet Union over 
British and French nuclear forces urged Soviet support for 
sanctions against Iran to end the IranIraq war and welcomed 
Gorbachevs announcement last week of a timetable for removing 
Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan 
Howe and Shevardnadze signed an agreement Monday committing 
their countries to working together to fight drug abuse and 
trafficking 
Shevardnadze and Howe last met Dec 7 at Brize Norton Royal Air 
Base where Gorbachev stopped off on his way to Washington The 
Soviet leader and Reagan signed an agreement to eliminate their 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons
