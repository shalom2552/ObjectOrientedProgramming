Since the Wall Street crash last fall many 
savers and investors have been taking a closer look at bond mutual 
funds as an alternative to stock funds 
Bond prices and bond fund net asset values have generally been 
rising since October as interest rates have fallen 
In fact most analysts agree one reason for that trend has been 
strong demand for bonds by investors large and small who have been 
scared away from the stock market 
But if bonds and bond funds are the trendy thing right now do 
they make sense as a place to put your money if you arent 
particularly interested in high current income from your savings 
Does the prospective reward match up well with the risks involved 
The overall return bond funds will produce in the future depends 
to a significant extent on such imponderables as what happens to 
interest rates and the economy 
If you think the nation is headed for a calamitous deflationary 
recession a fund investing in Treasury bonds would seem a logical 
bet 
The bonds are backed by a guarantee from the federal government 
And should circumstances ever reach the point that the United 
States defaults on its obligations just about all other domestic 
investments with the possible exception of gold will surely be in 
terrible shape as well 
If on the other hand you think a financial Armageddon isnt in 
the cards the question is more problematical A study just 
conducted by Burt Berry a San Francisco investment adviser may 
give you some pause before investing in a highquality bond fund 
In his newsletter NoLoad Fund X Berry compared the performance 
of four different types of funds over the 10year period that ended 
Dec 31 
That would seem a good test period in that it included a couple 
of recessions an energy crisis a nearpanic on inflation a long 
bull market for stocks and as a finale a market crash 
Especially pertinent for bonds it also contained spells of both 
high and rising interest rates and low and falling interest rates 
To represent the stock market Berry chose the Vanguard 500 
Index Trust a mutual fund set up to track as closely as possible 
the ups and downs of the Standard amp Poors 500stock composite 
index Each 100 invested in that fund at the end of 1977 grew to 
389 a decade later for an annual compound growth rate of 146 
percent 
As a gauge of the performance of highyielding lowerrated 
bonds widely known as junk bonds he picked the Fidelity 
High Income fund which increased a 100 investment over the 10 
years to 323 for an annual compound growth rate of 124 percent 
From the ranks of the highquality bond funds the Vanguard 
Fixed Income Securities Investment Grade Portfolio increased 100 
to 254 which translates to annual compound growth of 98 percent 
In the same span the Reserve Fund a money market fund turned 
100 into 258 producing annual growth of 99 percent 
A comparison of the last two funds is striking Holders of the 
highquality bond fund were not compensated for the constant risk 
they faced of fluctuations in the funds net asset value The 
return they received failed even to match what investors got from 
the money fund which normally has a constant net asset value 
This said Berry raises the question whether bond funds 
except for high yield bond funds merit the additional risk 
compared to money funds or the stock market
