WVa who has begun his 179day prison sentence for cocaine 
possession says it was stupid and weak of him to use the 
drug that cost him his office 
Why I did it You picked a question that will probably be the 
first thing I ask myself every day for the rest of my life Roark 
said in an interview published in Friday editions of the Charleston 
Daily Mail 
Roark 42 once known as Mad Dog for his zealous pursuit of 
drug offenders when he was a prosecutor reported to federal prison 
here Friday 
The former secondterm Republican mayor was scheduled to report 
to the Petersburg Federal Correction Institution on Monday but he 
showed up early because Monday is a federal holiday 
The former assistant US attorney and Kanawha County prosecutor 
resigned as mayor one week after pleading guilty Roark who had 
been mentioned as a possible GOP gubernatorial or congressional 
candidate told the newspaper he considers his political career 
finished 
Roark pleaded guilty last November to six misdemeanor counts of 
cocaine possession as part of a plea bargain In addition to

A decision by Idahos highest court to give 
singer Carole King the right to lock a gate on a backcountry road 
leading to her ranch could prompt legislative action says the 
states attorney general 
Ive heard a figure that there may be up to 65 of these 
controversies simmering around the state Attorney General Jim 
Jones said Friday adding that state legislators may want to 
provide a legislative remedy 
The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a district court 
ruling that the dirt road leading to the ranch was abandoned by 
Custer County in 1939 and therefore ceased to be public 
King and her husband Rick Sorensen put a locked gate across 
the road in July 1981 after moving to their backcountry ranch 
The Sorensons action was protested by neighbors who said they had 
used the road for years 
After Custer County declared the road open to public use the 
Sorensens took the matter to court
