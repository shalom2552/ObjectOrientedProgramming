Its Presidents Day and time for a party 
in this central Washington town 
Georges 260 people planned a community lunch complete with 
birthday cake childrens games and a lengthy bingo session 
Its a big deal said Winnie Davey of the George Exxon 
service station which is running a special on packaged cherry pies 
today The whole community is involved 
George located near the Columbia River was apparently named 
after the first president although some people assert that the 
town was actually named after a dog belonging to one of the 
founders 
You shouldnt believe everything you hear said Ms Davey 
which may be a sad commentary on the day celebrating the birth of a 
man who could not tell a lie 
But there is no doubt the town has taken much of its identity 
from George Washington and the symbols surrounding him 
For instance many streets are named after types of cherries 
including Royal Anne Montmorency and Bing said Ms Davey 
Businesses have names like the Martha Inn the Colonial Market 
and the Cherry Tree 
A highlight of todays activities at the community center will 
be an 18squarefoot birthday cake in the shape of a mountain with 
George Washingtons face drawn on it said Glenda Jenkins 
president of the organizing group known as the Georgettes 
The theme is George Washingtons head on Mount Rushmore she 
said of the cake which she believes will feed 1000 people 
although about 800 showed up last year 
George actually throws a bigger celebration including a parade 
during the Fourth of July because the weather is better said 
Carol Michael another organizer
