Australian Craig Logan picked a crisp cloudless 
day for his first trip to the top of the Empire State Building 
Wednesday But he did it the hard way he ran 
Logan led a field of 79 men and 27 women who thundered up the 
stairwell to the top of the 102story landmark for glory fitness 
and the firstplace prize of a MacIntosh computer in the 11th 
Annual Empire State Building RunUp His winning time was 11 
minutes 29 seconds 
It wasnt too bad really Logan a 26yearold pastry chef 
from Melbourne said modestly Still he admitted It gets a bit 
boring going around and around and around 
The top womens finisher was Olympic hopeful Janine Aiello of 
San Francisco whose time of 13 minutes 43 seconds was 28 seconds 
off her womens record in the event set in 1985 
Ms Aiello a native of Suffern NY interrupted her training 
for the Olympic marathon to compete for the fifth time in the 
event It feels great she said after her victory My mom was 
here my aunts from New York It was just so great to see their 
faces 
Logan said he won the opportunity to compete in the Empire State 
Building RunUp by winning a similar event last August in a 
56story hotel in Melbourne That one felt harder he said 
He attributed his victory in part to being the first man into 
the stairwell no small advantage considering the crunch of 
bodies that followed him

Naked as the day she was poured a nude 
woman on display with 22 other sculptures in a tony art gallery is 
attracting more than passing glances 
You can tell shes real look at the dirt on the soles of her 
feet Its a dead giveaway one spectator said Tuesday as he 
viewed the kneeling polyvinylid sculpture titled The Sphinx by 
Californian John De Andrea 
The eyecatching work is part of an exhibit showing through 
March 8 at the Helander Gallery in this posh island resort 
The 86000 sculpture with blue eyes ashen hair pulled into a 
loose bun and pearl earrings was chosen as the window piece 
because she is an exemplary of the exhibit and an excellent work of 
figure said gallery curator Wendy Cohen Also because we knew 
the effect she would have 
The only drawback is that we have to clean the windows five 
times a day because of the hand prints and noses pressed to the 
glass said Helander owner Bruce Helander 
It took five painstaking months for De Andrea to cover the 
figure with layers of transluscent fleshtoned paint and add 
veins freckles and beauty marks Ms Cohen said

Buck Bundy cleared the hurdles and 
pulled ahead of the pack with determination in his beady eyes When 
he crossed the finish line first the men in business suits cheered 
The race over the victorious mouse and 49 other racing rodents 
like him are loaded into an aquarium until the next gig 
Buck Bundy and his friends are on the fast track for 
success judging from the way the mouseracing business has been 
going for Ron Penland of Kansas City Mo 
Penland 38 has been taking his mice on the road to entertain 
at parties and conventions for 11 years He was in Springfield 
Tuesday for a meeting of the Illinois Grain and Feed Association 
Penland known as the Mouse Man makes a good living calling 
the mouse races The going rate to set up the 16foot track adorned 
with cat photos in Kansas City is a minimum of 350 
The creatures need very little training before hitting the 
track he said 
Their colors gray white black spotted or twotone help 
distinguish them during the heat of competition Lookalike mice 
get their tails colored with felttip markers 
Penland says he doesnt encourage gambling but just in case he 
posts the career winnings of the mice in each race on a posterboard 
The entrepreneur says he has never been bitten by the mice but 
did acknowledge one job hazard the smell which can be as bad as 
that of racing pigs
