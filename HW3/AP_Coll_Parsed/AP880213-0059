Researchers in Japan Switzerland and the United 
States are experimenting with a new class of ceramics which may 
carry larger electric currents than other superconductors a Swiss 
scientist reported 
Karl Alex Muller a 1987 Nobel laureate in physics told a 
breakfast meeting at Boston University on Friday the new ceramic 
compounds were discovered in Japan in January 
He said they were duplicated and improved by researchers in his 
Zurich laboratory 
Meanwhile Du Pont Co scientists Friday said they had been able 
to duplicate the Japanese results and had also identified the 
structure and composition of the ceramics 
Muller is scheduled to address the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science which is holding its annual meeting here 
on Monday 
I am very glad Im delighted that we have found these new 
compounds said Muller who received an honorary doctorate from 
the university Thursday With these temperatures you can be much 
more optimistic about achieving high currents 
The new ceramics may overcome a problem with other materials 
which bar the running of large currents through hightemperature 
superconductors researchers said 
Superconductors are materials which allow transmission of 
electricity with no resistance or loss of energy Materials which 
can carry high electric currents and generate large magnetic fields 
might lead to very fast computers andlong distance transmission of 
electricity 
A team of scientists at the National Institute for Metals in 
Tsukuba Japan was the first to find superconductivity in the new 
ceramics working at 243 degrees below zero 
The material is made up bismuth strontium calcium and copper 
mixed with oxygen 
Muller indicated that his team working for the International 
Business Machines Corp also had been able to identify the 
materials structure 
He said his group had achieved superconductivity at higher 
temperatures than the Japanese but declined to provide details 
Researchers are writing a report on the results said IBM 
spokesman Gerald Present 
Researchers in superconductivity have sought to find a stable 
reproducible material that works at temperatures above 288 degrees 
below zero Superconductivity becomes stronger as temperature drops
