Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner avoided a 
prison term for federal income tax evasion but agreed Friday to 
pay 3 million to help South Floridas homeless pay more than 4 
million in back taxes and penalties and give 5000 hours in 
community service over five years 
The 69yearold Miami Beach businessman whose holdings include 
controlling interests in Royal Crown Cola and Arbys had little to 
say after the sentencing hearing but told reporters 
Ive been involved in charity works all my life and Ive 
given millions and millions to charity 
US District Judge Eugene P Spellman cautioned Posner in court 
Not one dollar of the funds of this project are 
taxdeductible 
Posner faced up to 40 years in prison after pleading no contest 
Sept 29 to evading more than 12 million in federal taxes by 
inflating the value of land he donated to a Bible college as a tax 
exemption 
A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt only a statement 
that the defendant will offer no defense For sentencing purposes 
it is equal to a guilty plea or conviction 
Aside from paying the 4 million in back taxes penalties 
interest and fines Posner was ordered to pay the cost of his own 
prosecution 
Spellman said the homeless project will include Dade Broward 
and Palm Beach counties and he appointed a committee of civic 
leaders to determine how the money will be spent 
The judge warned that failure to abide by the terms of the 
agreement could result in jail time for Posner 
The judge directed that as part of his community service 
Posner spend five hours a day for one day each of the next eight 
weeks at Camillus House a downtown Miami mission for the homeless 
During the hearing Posners attorney Edward Bennett Williams 
of Washington DC pleaded for an alternative to jail time 
Williams said Posner had always considered the tax case a civil 
matter But the Internal Revenue Service did not see it that way 
and started a criminal investigation eight years ago 
Because it is a unique case it provides the court with an 
opportunity under which Mr Posner could give of himself and his 
resources for the benefit of South Florida Williams said 
There are matters crying out for remedy Williams told the 
court It would serve no useful purpose to incarcerate this 
defendant I appeal to your mercy and I appeal to your justice 
Assistant US Attorney Neil Cartusciello argued that a jail 
term was necessary as a deterrent to others 
Mr Posner lied to the Internal Revenue Service and he 
corrupted others he said In his statement to the probation 
officers he makes the same claims and tells the same lies 
He doesnt show hes remorseful that hes sorry The honest 
taxpayers end up paying a disproportionate burden the prosecutor 
said 
Posner entered the plea a month before he was to be retried His 
1986 conviction was set aside because of jury irregularities 
He pleaded in September to 10 charges conspiracy to evade 
income taxes four counts of tax evasion and five counts of making 
false statements in a tax return 
Posner was indicted in 1982 accused of filing false returns 
between 1975 and 1979 and evading 12 million in taxes by 
inflating the value of property he donated to Miami Christian 
College 
Miami real estate broker William H Scharrer Sr was charged 
with aiding and abetting in the tax violations He was convicted in 
1984 and sentenced to 18 months 
Posners holdings also include controlling interests in Sharon 
Steel and the Graniteville textile company He was named Americas 
highestpaid executive by Business Week magazine in 1985 
The industrialist who rarely grants public interview 
reportedly earned 86 million in 1986 and his fortune was 
estimated at 240 million by Forbes magazine in 1984 
He has sold off holdings in recent years to pay company debts 
His Evans Products Co and Sharon Steel filed for reorganization 
under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law
