Four men tried to hijack a 
Tanzania Airways jet to London but were overpowered Sunday after 
the pilot duped them into thinking he had flown them out of the 
country sources said 
Capt Dominic Ngandile was stabbed in the neck and hand and his 
copilot Christopher Mnika suffered cuts on his hands when the 
hijackers slashed at them after realizing they had been tricked 
said airline and security sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity They said the injuries were not serious 
None of the passengers on board the Boeing 737 was injured 
Officials said there were 70 passengers including the 
hijackers and a crew of six 
The sources said the hijacking occurred Saturday night aboard a 
Tanzania Airways flight between Dar es Salaam the capital and 
Kilimanjaro the northern town near the Kenya border 
Passengers said at 917 pm about midway through the 50minute 
flight four men forced their way into the cockpit and threatened 
the captain and copilot with knives 
Airline sources said the men demanded to be flown to London 
with a stop in Addis Ababa the Ethiopian capital so the plane 
could be refueled 
Ngandile told the hijackers that the plane did not have enough 
fuel to reach Addis Ababa and suggested he refuel instead at a 
small airport at Ludwar Kenya the sources said 
The hijackers agreed 
Instead of heading for Kenya Ngandile flew the plane in a wide 
arc and headed back to Dar es Salaam airport He also managed to 
send a secret distress signal to the control tower at Dar es Salaam 
Airport officials turned off the terminal lights and some of the 
runway lights to give the appearance that the plane was landing at 
a small airport 
The jet landed at about 1030 pm Security forces called to the 
airport stormed the plane and took the men into custody 
The four hijackers were described as residents of the 
semiautonomous island of Zanzibar They were believed to be 
between the ages of 16 and 20
