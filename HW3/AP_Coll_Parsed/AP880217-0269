Campeau Corp today boosted to 61 a share its 
tender offer for Federated Department Store Inc and promised to 
sweeten the offer again to 66 a share if Federated agrees to be 
acquired by midnight Sunday 
The move came a day after the giant retailers board rejected 
Campeaus separate proposal to pay 66 a share or about 585 
billion for Federated in a definitive merger agreement 
Federateds board meeting in New York on Tuesday instead 
approved a financial restructuring that could include the sale of 
most assets other than the companys department stores 
Campeau sweetened its tender offer to 61 a share or about 54 
billion from the 47 a share roughly 42 billion it initially 
offered on Jan 25 Federated rejected the initial tender offer as 
inadequate 
Federated stock fell 287 to 6087 a share in early New York 
Stock Exchange trading 
Federated also has rejected Campeaus alternative offer for a 
definitive merger agreement twice including the latest 66 
proposal and Campeaus initial 61 a share offer because it was 
not convinced Campeau had the necessary financing 
But Campeau spokeswoman Joele Frank said in New York today that 
financing for a 66 bid is absolutely solid 
On Tuesday Campeau said Youngstown Ohio developer Edward J 
DeBartolo agreed to increase his previously announced 400 million 
loan to 480 million to help support the buyout Torontos 
Reichmann family through its Olympia amp York Enterprises Ltd has 
agreed to buy a 260 million interest in Campeau Corp Campeau 
spokesmen said 
Campeau said the Bank of Montreal and Banque Paribas of France 
had agreed to provide 200 million each in equity and to coax 
another 100 million in equity from other banks 
The developer reiterated today that First Boston Corp said in a 
letter it is highly confident it could provide up to 1 billion 
in bridge financing 
Campeau said in a statement that it will increase its tender 
offer to 66 a share if Federated enters into a definitive 
agreement to be acquired by midnight Sunday 
The tender offer is conditioned upon certain recently enacted 
antitakeover legislation being invalidated or not applicable to 
the offer Campeau said in a statement 
The developer is challenging a new antitakeover law in Delaware 
as unconstitutional While Federated is based in Cincinnati it is 
incorporated in Delaware 
Federated said Tuesday its bankers and financial advisers 
studied the latest bid and decided that Campeau did not have the 
financing for such a transaction and that its ability to arrange 
financing continued to be questionable 
Federated said its investment bankers believed the companys 
shareholders could be hurt if Federated entered into an agreement 
with Campeau and the transaction couldnt be completed at the 
specified price 
The Federated board of directors then authorized negotiations 
with other unspecified parties that have shown an interest in 
buying Federated or some of the companys assets 
The company said in a statement The board also considered a 
restructuring plan which would involve sales of most of 
Federateds nondepartment store assets the possible issuance of 
preferred stock and either an extraordinary dividend or the 
repurchase of more than 50 percent of Federateds outstanding stock 
The board requested that management proceed intensively with 
the further development of such a plan and authorized management 
to negotiate the terms of such preferred stock and to obtain prompt 
bids for all of Federateds nondepartment store assets 
Federateds directors said a shareholders rights plan adopted 
by the board last month would take effect Thursday The plan known 
as a poison pill defense is designed to discourage an unwanted 
takeover by making such a move more expensive 
The company which operates about 650 stores in 36 states and 
had sales exceeding 11 billion in 1987 said Nov 28 it had 885 
million shares outstanding 
Federated said it spent the weekend negotiating with numerous 
parties including Campeau which bought Allied Stores Corp in 
December 1986 
Among those believed to be interested is the takeover specialist 
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp Co based in New York 
Last week in a letter to Henry Kravis Campeau Chairman Robert 
Campeau warned that any agreement between Kohlberg Kravis and 
Federated would be challenged in court 
After the Allied purchase Campeau sold several Allied divisions 
but retained several retailing chains including Ann Taylor Brooks 
Brothers and Jordan Marsh 
Federateds holdings include the New Yorkbased Bloomingdales 
and Abraham and Straus Filenes of Boston Burdines of Miami 
Richs in Atlanta Bullocks and Bullocks Wilshire in Los Angeles 
I Magnin in San Francisco and Lazarus in Ohio
