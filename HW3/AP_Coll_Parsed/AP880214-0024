Panama skating on the edge of a fiscal 
disaster was awaiting word from private bankers this week on 
whether they will accept a bailout scheme that could keep the 
country out of default 
Ricaurte Vasquez Panamas planning minister met in New York 
late last week with a committee representing 150 commercial bank 
creditors in a new effort to keep the country afloat by delaying 
loan interest payments 
Panama owes the private banks 200 million in interest this 
year with the bulk of it scheduled to come due in midMarch But 
the countrys dollar reserves are virtually depleted and it is 
unlikely it can meet its commitments 
Vasquez first met with the creditor committee in December and 
asked that 100 million of the interest due this year be added to 
the principal for future payment The bankers were said to have 
shown little interest in that plan 
It was not known if Vasquez offered the bankers a new bailout 
plan last week but he said recently that his government might have 
to dismiss as many as 15000 public employees next month to reduce 
its cash flow 
One out of every four Panamanian workers is employed by the 
government many owing their jobs to loyalty to the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party which has close ties to the countrys de facto 
leader Gen Manuel Antonio Noriega 
Much of what little popularity Noriega still retains comes 
from the public sector said a Western diplomat If the 
government is forced to make layoffs in that sector it obviously 
wont help Noriegas image 
Noriega has been under pressure to resign since last summer from 
a broad but loose coalition known as the National Civic Crusade It 
counts more than 200 civic business professional labor and other 
groups as members 
The oppositions charges of corruption against Noriega were 
given added weight earlier this month when he was indicted by 
federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa Fla on charges of drug 
smuggling money laundering and racketeering 
The general who dominates the counrys civilian government as 
head of Panamas Defense Forces sent his army into the streets 
last year to quell demonstrations by the Civic Crusade and the 
opposition has increasingly turned to what one official called 
economic warfare 
The tactics which have added to the governments fiscal woes 
include removal of deposits from state banks and the avoidance or 
late payment of utility fees and taxes The Civic Crusade also has 
called several nationwide strikes but none has been particularly 
successful 
The Crusades activities are an annoyance Im sure said 
the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity But thats a 
really small part of Panamas problem 
The problem which Noriega inherited comes from a huge public 
debt rolled up by a predecessor Gen Omar Torrijos who came to 
power in a 1968 coup and began an ambitious program of building 
schools health clinics roads and other public facilities 
The World Bank put Panamas total foreign debt at 48 billion 
at the end of 1986 the latest year for which figures are 
available The US Commerce Department says the government 
declared itself in informal indefinite default to all 
governmental lenders last year meaning it made no interest or 
principal payments 
The United States halted all aid to Panamas government last 
year and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also 
cut off lending programs pending compliance by Panama with an IMF 
demand for a restructuring of its social security programs 
Diplomats and private economists say the government has been 
loathe to make the reforms for fear of losing further popular 
support particularly among the lower and middle classes who 
benefit most from the programs 
The governments fiscal crisis appears to have had little effect 
on the private economy particularly among the more than 120 
foreign banks that maintain offices here and make Panama one of the 
Western Hemispheres largest banking centers 
The banking sector could face problems if the crisis deepens 
because it is highly dependent on a sense of confidence and 
stability the diplomat said But so far there have been no 
failures nobody has pulled out and deposits remain relatively 
stable
