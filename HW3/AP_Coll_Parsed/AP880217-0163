Gary Dotson the convicted rapist who was 
freed from prison in 1985 after his alleged victim recanted on 
Wednesday was ordered behind bars for at least six months for 
violating the conditions of his parole 
The Illinois Prisoner Review Board rejected Dotsons plea for 
another chance and ruled that he had violated the terms of parole 
for failing to report to his parole officer last Dec 24 
The board ordered Dotson held in state prison until Aug 16 
when he will be eligible for parole again and may be released from 
prison if he complies with conditions set by the board said Nic 
Howell a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections 
Dotson was ordered by the board to undergo a substance abuse 
treatment program while in prison 
Dotsons case drew national attention when Cathleen Crowell 
Webb now a New Hampshire homemaker recanted her testimony that 
Dotson had raped her when she was a suburban teenager 
After three days of hearings in 1985 Gov James R Thompson 
commuted Dotsons sentence of 25 to 50 years to the six years he 
had served The governor did not pardon Dotson saying he did not 
believe the recantation 
Since then Dotson has had numerous scrapes with the law which 
under the goodconduct terms of his commutation could result in him 
being ordered to serve out the remainder of his sentence 
Dotson was imprisoned last year for violating his parole terms 
by being convicted on drunken driving charges Thompson freed 
Dotson a second time when he modified his 1985 commutation order to 
allow Dotson out on Dec 24 in what the governor called a 
lastchance deal 
Two days later Dotson was arrested after a bar fight in 
suburban Calumet City Prosecutors later dropped battery charges in 
that incident but Dotson remained in jail on a parole hold 
Dotson told the review board during a hearing Tuesday that he is 
an alcoholic and needed treatment 
The ruling disappointed Dotsons family 
I just dont understand why theyve got to keep him in jail 
said Laura Dotson one of his five sisters Why cant they just 
put him in a halfway house or something Hes been in jail long 
enough for something he didnt do We want him in a rehab but not 
in jail
