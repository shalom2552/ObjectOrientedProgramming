Bushs 28 percent Given the polls 5 percent margin of error they 
are essentially tied 
Rep Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson had 12 percent each former 
Delaware Gov Pete du Pont 7 percent and 6 percent were undecided

According to a poll for the Boston Herald and WBZTV Dole leads 
Bush 32 percent to 31 percent On Feb 9 one day after Doles 
victory in the Iowa caucuses Bush led Dole 32 percent to 23 
percent The other GOP candidates were in single digits according 
to the survey of 500 likely Republican voters The margin of error 
was 4 percent 
On the Democratic side Dukakis held comfortable leads in the 
Gallup and HeraldWBZ surveys 
The Gallup poll showed the Massachusetts governor at 39 percent 
followed by Richard Gephardt at 18 percent and Paul Simon at 16 
percent The other Democrats trailed far behind among the 424 
likely Democratic voters surveyed The margin of error was 4 
percent 
The HeraldWBZ survey put Dukakis at 38 percent Next came 
Gephardt at 19 percent and Simon at 13 percent among the 500 likely 
voters polled 
A CBS News poll and a ABC NewsWashington Post survey both 
released Sunday also suggested that Dole who is coming off a 
convincing win in last weeks Iowa caucuses is now even with Bush 
Among the Democrats Dukakis remained the runaway leader with 
Simon of Illinois and Gephardt of Missouri fighting for second 
The CBS poll gave Gephardt a slightly higher level of support 
The CBS survey was conducted Feb 1213 while the ABCPost poll 
was based on interviews Feb 1113 
Among Republicans the CBS survey ran down the race this way 
Dole 31 percent Bush 30 percent Kemp 11 percent Robertson 10 
percent Dupont 10 percent and undecided 8 percent 
Given the 4percentagepoint sampling error margin for the 
survey Dole and Bush are essentially tied In a previous CBS 
survey on Feb 1011 Dole had 32 percent and Bush had 29 percent 
In the ABCPost interviews among Republicans here was the 
breakdown Dole 31 percent Bush 28 percent Kemp 13 percent 
Robertson 11 percent du Pont 11 percent Former secretary of 
state Alexander Haig who dropped out Friday drew 1 percent and 4 
percent were undecided 
The ABC survey was based on interviews with 374 likely GOP 
voters The CBS survey was based on interviews with 594 likely GOP 
voters 
Among Democrats the ABC poll laid out the race in this fashion 
Dukakis 40 percent Simon 17 percent Gephardt 16 percent Jesse 
Jackson 7 percent Sen Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee 7 percent 
Former Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt 6 percent Former Colorado Sen 
Gary Hart 3 percent undecided or others 5 percent 
The CBS survey gave Gephardt a bit of an edge and Simon a 
smaller number Dukakis 42 percent Gephardt 18 percent Simon 
12 percent Jackson 4 percent Gore 4 percent Hart 4 percent 
Babbitt 3 percent undecided 13 percent 
The CBS survey was based on interviews with 483 likely 
Democratic voters The ABC survey was based on interviews with 383 
likely GOP voters 
As with all random sample surveys these polls are subject to 
variations because of chance fluctuations in the sample 
For polls based on about 400 interviews such as both ABC polls 
that sampling error margin is 6 percentage points either way 
That is if all likely New Hampshire voters with telephones were 
interviewed the results of these polls would vary by 6 percentage 
points simply because of chance variations in the sample 
For polls based on aout 500 interviews like the CBS Democratic 
survey the sampling error margin is 5 percentage points For 
polls based on about 600 interviews like the CBS Republican 
survey the sampling error margin is 4 percentage points
