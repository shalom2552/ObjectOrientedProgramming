Judges used broad discretion granted under the 
newly enacted Bail Reform Act of 1984 to jail a sharply higher 
percentage of people awaiting trial for federal crimes the 
government said Sunday 
The chances of being jailed while awaiting trial for people 
accused of serious narcotics violations were 20 percent higher 
after the law took effect than previously said the study by the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics 
After the bail reforms took effect in November 1984 the 
probability of being jailed was 63 percent higher for people 
accused of causing injuries It was 23 percent higher for those who 
had used firearms and 17 percent higher for those classified as 
dangerous during pretrial interviews 
Overall 29 percent of the defendants awaiting trial on federal 
criminal charges were incarcerated until they appeared in court 
This was an increase from 24 percent who were held during the same 
period in 1983 
The study was based on information collected during a sixmonth 
period in 1985 
The act permits federal courts to deny bail altogether if the 
government proves that no conditions of release will reasonably 
assure either the safety of the community or the appearance of the 
defendant at trial 
The report suggests that pretrial detention is being used as an 
alternative to holding people under high bail
