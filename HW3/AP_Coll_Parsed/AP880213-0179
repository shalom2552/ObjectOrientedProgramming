A note purportedly from the kidnappers of 
two UN relief workers said Saturday the hostages would be freed 
within a week if their interrogation proved their innocence

to protest the kidnappings which the UN relief agency blamed on 
Palestinian individuals acting without a political motive

services that cover 270000 refugees in Lebanon if the two 
Scandinavians were not released
