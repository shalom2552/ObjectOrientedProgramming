AntiCastro militant Orlando Bosch returned here 
confident he will have freedom after his third acquittal in 
Venezuela on charges he planned the 1976 explosion of a Cuban 
jetliner that killed 73 people his lawyer said 
Bosch immediately was taken into custody by US marshals upon 
his arrival Tuesday from Caracas He faces charges of violating 
parole on his 1972 conviction in a bazooka attack on a Polish ship 
here 
Bosch 61 made a brief appearance before US Magistrate Linnea 
Johnson who scheduled a preliminary parole hearing for today No 
decision was expected 
Boschs attorney Hank Adorno said his client should be 
released because he voluntarily returned to face the charges 
Adorno said Bosch fled the United States in 1974 only because his 
life was in danger 
He served 11 or 11 years in a Venezuelan prison for a crime 
he didnt commit Adorno said He should be allowed to live as 
a productive member of the CubanAmerican community 
But Adorno said legal technicalities made a quick release for 
Bosch unlikely 
He knew when he came here what he was getting into said 
Boschs wife Adriana We are confident when it is all over he 
will be free 
The news of Boschs arrival took Miamis closely knit Cuban 
community by surprise but initial reactions were positive 
At last the man is free said Jorge Mas Canosa head of the 
influential Cuban American National Foundation adding that the 
communitys reaction is one of rejoicing 
He said he recently received a letter from Bosch indicating an 
embracing of the foundations more peaceful approach to 
democratizing Cuba 
Bosch was found innocent in Venezuela of the bombing charges for 
a third time Aug 7 and was held in a secret location by Venezuelan 
police for security reasons while awaiting an appeal by the 
prosecution But no appeal was filed within a 90day limit and the 
acquittal held 
After Bosch fled to Venezuela he was charged with planning the 
Cuban airliner explosion Most of those killed in the blast were 
Cuban athletes who had competed in a Central American and Caribbean 
Games competition in Venezuela 
Venezuelans Hernan Ricardo and Freddy Lugo were sentenced to 20 
years for the bombing A fourth defendant Cubanborn Luis Posada 
Carriles escaped from jail in 1986 and reportedly was fighting 
with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua 
Bosch contended he was framed by proCastro forces for the 1968 
attack on the Polish freighter which was engaged in trade with 
Cuba The ship was dented and there were no injuries but the 
United States formally apologized to Poland and the FBI cracked 
down on militant antiCastro groups
