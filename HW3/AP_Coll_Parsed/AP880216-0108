Lawyers for American Telephone amp Telegraph Co 
argued Tuesday that the company should be awarded government 
telecommunications contracts worth millions of dollars because a 
General Services Administration employee leaked secret ATampT bid 
information to competitors 
ATampT attorney C Stanley Dees told the GSA board of contract 
appeals that the federal agency had received information on at 
least three occasions suggesting that ATampTs price had been 
disclosed but GSA let the bidding proceed anyway 
GSA attorney Edward Gregorowicz defended the contracts to 
upgrade the federal telephone system known as FTS saying there 
was no basis for ATampTs charges 
The real issue is that ATampT has been the queen mother of the 
FTS network for 25 years it got fat fell asleep and lost its 
throne Gregorowicz said 
The contracts worth 55 million for 12 large electronic 
switches are being investigated by the GSAs inspector generals 
office the Justice Department and the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee 
The procurement has been watched closely because GSA is also 
handling the bidding on contracts for an allnew federal phone 
system worth as much as 25 billion over 10 years 
ATampT the only company to bid for all 12 switches protested 
after it won contracts for only five switches It had been the sole 
bidder for four of the five 
Regional Bell phone companies won contracts for the other seven 
Bell Atlantic BellSouth and US West each got contracts for two 
switches in their areas and Pacific Telesis got one 
ATampT says it should get the contracts for all 12 switches 
because of the alleged GSA improprieties 
After the contracts were awarded last October ATampT charged that 
GSA had misled the company during bidding and evaluated ATampTs bid 
differently than the regional companies proposals in an effort to 
give the contracts to companies other than ATampT 
Later ATampT added another charge that GSA engineer Sureshar L 
Soni provided confidential ATampT price information to Bell Atlantic 
BellSouth and US West 
BellSouth has offered to withdraw from its contract because its 
own internal investigation found that its bid may have been 
compromised by information passed to the company 
Soni has refused to answer questions about his role in the 
procurement invoking his Fifth Amendment right against 
selfincrimination in a deposition earlier this month He also 
refused to answer questions about his daughter Neelam who was 
hired by BellSouth as a managertrainee last April when bids were 
being formulated 
Bell Atlantic and US West deny they received proprietary 
information and used it to develop their bids Bell Atlantic has 
said the information Soni offered was of no value because he 
appeared to be restating ATampTs current rates which are publicly 
available 
GSA alleges that ATampT also may have received confidential 
information and used it to develop its bids ATampT says that when 
Soni told an ATampT official the companys initial bid for the 
Washington DC switch was not good enough to win he was 
stating the obvious since ATampT knew its initial bid did not reflect 
GSAs required 10 percent discount of current prices 
Gregorowicz said ATampT could have raised alleged improprieties 
with the board of contract appeals during the bidding but did not 
This conduct cannot be rewarded by the board he said
