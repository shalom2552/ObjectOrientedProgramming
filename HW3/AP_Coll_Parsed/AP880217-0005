Former television evangelist Pat Robertson 
took in stride his bottomofthepile finish in the New Hampshire 
primary Tuesday saying he was ready to shine in the South in my 
backyard 
With returns nearly complete in the Republican primary 
Robertson was last among the five contenders 
We played in Bob Doles backyard in Iowa and I beat George 
Bush there Robertson said We played in New Hampshire which 
according to George Bush is his backyard and he won convincingly 
Tomorrow morning I go into the South and theyre going to be 
playing in my backyard Robertson said in a concession speech at 
a hotel ballroom as several hundred supporters cheered stomped and 
chanted We want Pat 
Robertson 57 with his wife Dede at his side said 
Im throwing the gauntlet down to Bob Dole and George Bush 
South Carolina is the first Super Tuesday state and Im going to 
beat you there convincingly 
South Carolina Republicans actually vote the Saturday before 
Super Tuesday when 20 states hold caucuses or primaries 
The crowd cheered again when one supporter yelled out Youve 
got the biggest backyard Pat 
Earlier Robertsons national field director Richard Pinsky 
acknowledged that after Robertsons surprise secondplace showing 
in the Feb 8 Iowa caucuses We were hoping to do better here 
Robertson said in an interview on NBCTV Our polling showed 
we would have a strong third place We came up very short on that 
Pinsky blamed Robertsons showing on two controversies in the 
past week Kemps charges about allegations made by a group from 
which Robertson distanced himself and Robertsons claim during a 
GOP debate Sunday that the Soviet Union has nukes in Cuba 
Robertson was hounded Monday by questions on his statement 
during the debate and subsequently said his was not a 
categorical statement per se 
But in his concession remarks Robertson said he will meet with 
Cuban leaders in Florida this week and It may be that something 
happened in the debate here which may be the key to victory in 
Florida 
Later he said Weve got an issue that came out of here on the 
Cuban missiles I wasnt expecting it to play this way but Im 
getting reports from Texas and Florida that the people down there 
are with me on this issue So New Hampshire may have given me the 
key issue to win the two biggest states in the South
