An airport restaurant employee who gave Mayor 
Eugene Sawyer a 495 beef sandwich without charging him was fired 
Friday for misappropriation of company funds 
Police officers at the airport get free coffee sandwiches and 
doughnuts Michael Bueschel 23 said after getting his pink 
slip I figured if Chicago police officers could get a free 
sandwich why couldnt the mayor 
Bueschel said he was fired by management of Midway Airport 
Restaurant Inc when he reported to work Friday afternoon 
He said the reason for his dismissal was listed as 
misappropriation of company funds 
Sawyer upon hearing about Bueschels firing was not pleased 
said the mayors press secretary Monroe Anderson 
He thought that they had carried policy to its extreme limit 
and that if the young man didnt find a job hed find him a job or 
give him a job himself because he didnt think the punishment fit 
the crime Anderson said 
Bueschel said restaurant managers Guy Accetura and Michael 
Oswald told him he was dismissed from the 5anhour job at the 
Cafe Volare as a result of not charging Sawyer for a sandwich 
Thursday 
Oswald told The Associated Press he would have no comment He 
said Accetura wasnt at work late Friday There was no home 
telephone listing for Accetura in Chicago directory assistance 
WLSTV reported that restaurant managers thought they had to 
fire Bueschel because other company employees had been dismissed 
for giving food away and they feared that making an exception would 
lead to a discrimination lawsuit 
Its company policy not to give anything for free to friends 
and such but as far as the mayor is concerned I thought this was 
the way to take care of the guy Bueschel said 
Sawyer was at the airport on his way to a speaking engagement in 
Alabama when he got his free meal from Bueschel a sixmonth 
employee of the cafe 
A security officer for the mayor had ordered the sandwich which 
he then received with a note from Bueschel on the takeout box 
Mr Mayor keep up the good work Compliments of Cafe Volare 
Bueschel said the mayor then returned the favor with a handshake 
and said Thanks for the sandwich 
Bueschel is a sophomore at Richard J Daley College a school 
named for the longtime mayor who died in office 
Sawyer was appointed mayor by the City Council last year after 
the death of Mayor Harold Washington
