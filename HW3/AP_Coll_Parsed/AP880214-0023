The University of Rhode Islands 
traditional Thursday night fraternity parties have succumbed to the 
complaints of professors who teach Friday morning classes 
The Interfraternity Council voted last week to stop holding the 
beer blasts after professors complained that too many students were 
sleeping in class or skipping it entirely the next day 
We feel that the fraternity system has a commitment to 
education and Thursday night parties seemed to hinder us in 
attaining that goal said Eric Andreozzi of Phi Gamma Delta 
president of the council 
In addition Thursday night parties dated from a time when most 
URI students were Rhode Island residents who headed home on Friday 
but more students these days are likely to live on campus
