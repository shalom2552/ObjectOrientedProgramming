The late Roy Cohn says in his autobiography that 
the judge in the famous Rosenberg spy case decided before the trial 
that he would put Julius Rosenberg to death 
Cohn was a member of the prosecution team Excerpts from his 
yettobe published autobiography written with journalist Sidney 
Zion were published Tuesday in New York Magazine 
Cohn who was 24 at the time of the 1951 spy trial also 
asserted that US District Judge Irving R Kaufman telephoned him 
during the trial to seek his advice on a penalty for Ethel 
Rosenberg 
Cohn said he recommended the death penalty 
The Rosenbergs were convicted of selling atomic secrets to the 
Soviet Union and were executed in 1953 
A law clerk for Kaufman who is still on the bench said The 
judge is not available and its the policy of the chambers not to 
comment on press reports 
Cohn who became chief counsel to Sen Joseph McCarthy during 
the Red scare hearings of the 1950s died of heart failure and 
AIDSrelated illnesses in August 1986 
During a stormy career that included bitter runins with the 
Internal Revenue Service and many public figures Cohns veracity 
was frequently challenged 
In the book Cohn recalled that Kaufman said he sought divine 
guidance before deciding on the Rosenbergs sentences 
I cant confirm or deny this So far as I know the closest he 
got to prayer was the phone booth next to the Park Avenue 
Synagogue He called from that booth to a phone behind the bench in 
the courtroom to ask my advice on whether he ought to give the 
death penalty to Ethel Rosenberg There was never any question 
about Julius Kaufman had told me before the trial started that he 
was going to sentence Julius Rosenberg to death 
Cohn said Kaufman was concerned about public reaction to a woman 
being executed 
Cohn said he told Kaufman that shes worse than Julius so 
unless youre willing to say that a woman is immune from the death 
penalty I dont see how you can justify sparing her
