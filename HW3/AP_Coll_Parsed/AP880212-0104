Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern didnt mind 
playing two squares in the comedy hymn to marital fidelity Shes 
Having a Baby In fact they liked the movies emphasis on 
oldstyle morals 
Oldfashioned is newfashioned lets face it Bacon said 
Directorwriter John Hughes is basically an oldvalues type of 
guy in all his movies McGovern said And his story of a young 
couple Jake and Kristy Briggs is a tribute to suburbia and to 
the virtue of commitment 
Though the actors are young Bacon is 29 McGovern is 26 both 
are examples of another oldfashioned virtue hard work They 
recently talked about just how hard it was to bring out Baby 
One scene the Briggs wedding was shot over 26 consecutive 
hours It was filmed in the Winnetka Congregational Church in 
Illinois which was available for only a limited time 
Two versions of the scene were filmed a straightforward 
account of the wedding and Jakes hallucination about what his 
wedding vows really mean 
Wilt thou listen to endless conversations about childrens 
clothes and decorator checkbooks the minister asks in the 
fantasy version 
The marathon session demanded a lot of Bacon I actually fell 
asleep on my feet he said 
Bacon who previously appeared in Diner and Footloose 
is on the screen in almost every frame of the film In one scene 
Jake sits outside the church with his best man who tries to tempt 
him not to get married 
The struggle Bacon says was to win the audiences sympathy 
despite the fact that his character is on the brink of jilting the 
beautiful Kristy 
I really wanted him to seem like a little boy in a monkey 
suit and that was difficult Bacon said 
McGoverns travails were more subtle Her character Kristy 
appears bland But shes not said the actress 
Kristy is very strong although she doesnt necessarily appear 
on the surface to be strong said McGovern who first drew 
attention in the industry with her portrayal of Timothy Huttons 
girlfriend in 1980 in the Academy Awardwinning Ordinary 
People The next year she had a supporting actress Oscar 
nomination for her role in Ragtime 
Shes a person you wouldnt ever think twice about McGovern 
said But before the end of the movie The door opens on her soul 
and you see how much there is she has to offer 
Both actors lauded Hughes direction As strong and 
independent as I come off on the set I need a director who will 
say OK thats good you got it Bacon said Hughes did that 
for him 
McGovern agreed I always felt supported and I always knew 
that he would guide me 
By the end of the filming Hughes trusted Bacon to improvise 
One touching and funny result has Jake trying natural childbirth 
methods massaging his abdomen and panting while Kristy gives 
birth in another room 
By that point Id been playing this character so many times 
and in so many different situations that I really felt that I knew 
him and John knew him And he just kind of said Well turn 
the camera on and you just hang out in the room and do what you 
would do 
The tension Bacon has felt in front of the camera in other 
movies didnt apply in this one he said John sort of blows all 
that tension right out of the water by letting the camera roll 
during retakes instead of shouting Action or Cut a lot 
The atmosphere during filming was relaxed enough for Bacon to 
bring along his dog Jane whom he calls a Labrador deceiver 
a mutt thats part Lab 
Bacon and McGovern are both accomplished on the New York stage 
and are used to feeding on the energy of an audience But in a way 
McGovern said the director filled that function 
When he was looking at me he would see Kristy he wouldnt see 
Elizabeth she said
