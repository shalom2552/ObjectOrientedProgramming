A historian on the panel that investigated 
President Kurt Waldheims wartime past said Britain or America 
could have missing records that show whether Waldheim was involved 
in the executions of six British commandos 
Historian Gerald Fleming who is pressing US archivists about 
the German army records spoke Wednesday a day after Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher ordered a new investigation into 
Waldheims alleged connection with the executions 
The commandos were captured in the Balkans in 1944 and 
interrogated by the German army unit in which Waldheim was an 
intelligence officer 
We need to know who signed the interrogations and who 
initialed them The honor of this country is at stake said 
Fleming in an interview 
This will give us that final stone in the large mosaic on 
which the commission labored said Fleming the only British 
member of the international commission that investigated Waldheim 
The commissions report released last week questioned 
Waldheims moral integrity saying he was in close proximity to 
Nazi atrocities when he served as a lieutenant in the German army 
during World War II 
The panel left open the question of whether Waldheim committed 
war crimes but it concluded that Waldheim tried to cover up his 
involvement in the war 
It also found that Waldheim knew of Adolf Hitlers orders for 
the merciless extermination of captured Allied commandos 
The Austrian government appointed the commission in 1986 after 
the US Justice Department banned Waldheim from the United States 
placing him on a watch list of undesirable aliens 
Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing during the war 
In Vienna meanwhile a session of the conservative national 
leadership was called today to discuss the negative impact of the 
historians report 
The conservative tabloid Kurier today quoted unidentified 
sources as saying the meeting of Peoples Party leaders would 
reconsider its defense of the president 
Waldheim who is not a member of the Peoples Party has enjoyed 
unqualified support from its senior oficials But recently several 
prominent conservative politicians have criticized the president 
In Britain Mrs Thatcher ordered the commando investigation 
reopened under pressure from a British legislator Robert Rhodes 
James who was on Waldheims staff while Waldheim was UN 
secretarygeneral from 197282 
Rhodes James claims the Soviet Union knew at the end World War 
II that Yugoslavia accused Waldheim of being a war criminal He 
also contends that Britain and America also may have covered up 
facts when Waldheim became UN chief 
Yugoslavia dropped its charges against Waldheim but never has 
explained why 
In the interview Fleming dealt diplomatically with questions 
about a possible AngloAmerican coverup of the commando incident 
I incline to the view they the interrogation records are 
in the hands of some military authority or government authority 
over here or in America 
If they do exist it would seem extraordinary that they have 
not come to light up to now he said 
Fleming said he has had no reply to a letter he sent Jan 23 to 
Robert Wolfe head of the US Modern Military Archives in 
Washington asking about the interrogation records 
Fleming who has written again said the silence is unusual when 
contrasted with prompt responses he has received previously 
A raiding party of Greek partisans and seven British commandos 
was captured in a small boat off the Germanoccupied Greek island 
of Alimina 
One commando divulged military secrets and survived The rest 
who refused to talk were handed over to representatives of 
Waldheims immediate superior Lt Col Herbert Warstorff British 
Foreign Office records show 
Fleming said German military documents of the capture known as 
the Alimina file lack records of the second interrogation of the 
commandos by Waldheims unit before they faced firing squads 
Attached to the Alimina file was a note scrawled in English 
saying Do not film this sheet Interrogations reports removed 
because of security classification 
Some of the British Foreign Office and Defense Ministry 
documents about the commandos have been destroyed The Foreign 
Office said the files were shredded in 1978 in routine 
housecleaning 
A 1986 inquiry based on remaining British government records did 
not link Waldheim to the executions 
But Rhodes James pressed this week for another inquiry following 
the historical commissions investigations 
The role of successive British governments must be examined 
Rhodes James a member of Mrs Thatchers Conservative Party told 
reporters Tuesday There is a consistent pattern of a coverup
