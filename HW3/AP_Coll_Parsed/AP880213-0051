It could be months before an ironworker 
learns whether he will regain the use of a hand torn off in an 
industrial accident and joined to his abdomen for 2 months to save 
it doctors say 
Twelve doctors reattached Mike Thomas hand to his arm during 
22 hours of surgery that ended Friday Thomas 31 of Cleveland 
Ala was in serious condition in an intensive care unit at 
University Hospital 
To our knowledge this is the first time a severed limb has 
been kept alive this way in the United States said hospital 
spokesman Hank Black 
Even if the surgery turns out successful the nerve damage to 
the hand was such that Thomas will never be able to do the type 
work he did before said one of the surgeons Paul Sauer 
Hopefully we will have a hand which will at least have enough 
feeling to serve as a helper to Mr Thomas other hand and one 
that is cosmetically superior to a prosthesis he said 
He said that Thomas would be required to keep his left arm and 
hand in a cradlelike position 
Sauer and another surgeon Michael Miller said it might be 
months before Miller learns whether he will be able to use his left 
hand at all If the reattachment doesnt work they said the hand 
might have to be amputated 
Meanwhile he will go through intensive therapy 
We think that we can achieve adequate circulation to the hand 
and that the bone will grow together but how well the nerves and 
muscles will regenerate is the question Sauer said 
Using microscopes and sutures thinner than a human hair the 
surgeons reattached two of the three main nerves to the hand 
Thomas lost the hand wrist and a small part of his forearm when 
he grabbed a cable to break a 70foot fall from a girder while he 
was working at a church Nov 24 The cable wrapped around his 
forearm and pulled the hand off 
Because the break was not clean doctors said they were not 
sure at first whether the nerves were damaged too badly to allow 
the implant 
To gain time to study the problem they decided to attach the 
hands arteries veins and skin to those on his abdomen 
Such an attachment has been used twice once successfully in 
Yugoslavia with a broken limb attached to blood vessels under an 
arm doctors said 
Thomas is expected to return home within two weeks
