aides will apply to travel to Australia next month to attend an 
international trade union meeting a spokesman for the banned 
Polish union said Wednesday

Melbourne on March 1418 to attend the World Congress of the 
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions

Trade Unions Onyszkiewicz said 
Contacted at home in Gdansk Walesa said he received the 
invitation and would like to make the trip but declined further 
comment

Poland since the union was declared illegal after the 1981

abroad but did not receive it for technical reasons Walesa 
said

for the Australian trip very soon but the spokesman said he was
