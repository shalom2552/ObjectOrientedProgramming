A runoff election will be held next week 
between a proWestern conservative and a communistbacked 
millionaire to determine who will replace President Spyros 
Kyprianou who lost his bid for a third term 
Final results from Sundays presidential election in the Greek 
Cypriot part of this wardivided Mediterranean island put 
conservative Glafcos Clerides on top with with 333 percent 
followed by businessman George Vassiliou with 301 percent and 
Kyprianou with 273 percent 
Kyprianou 55 who remains head of the centrist Democratic 
Party conceded defeat in a televised address and said he will 
continue striving on the basis of the same policy as before He 
was running for a third fiveyear term 
I see the result as approval by the people of a nonparty 
independent candidate to unite the people said Vassiliou an 
independent backed by the Communist Party I am sure next Sunday 
will complete the renewal to enable us to face the difficult future 
for the settlement of our problem said Vassiliou 56 founder of 
the largest market research firm in the Middle East 
The results made the Feb 21 runoff between Clerides and 
Vassiliou certain since neither polled more than half of the vote 
as required by the constitution of Cyprus which gained 
independence from Britain in 1960 
Clerides 69 a proponent of an allparty national unity 
government said There has been no victor or vanquished in this 
election since I will ask the other parties including the 
Democratic Party to participate in a coalition Cabinet His 
rightwing party is considered proWestern 
The leader of the small Socialist Party Vassos Lyssarides 
polled 92 percent With all 334407 ballots counted Clerides had 
111491 Vassiliou 100635 Kyprianou 91262 and Lyssarides 30832 
An independent Thrassos Georghiades had 187 votes or 006 
percent 
Voting was uneventful Sunday despite mudslinging during the 
campaign and warnings by the rival candidates of imminent 
assassination attempts bombings and other violence A midday car 
bomb explosion in the southern port city of Limassol killed three 
senior Palestinian guerrilla officers But a Cyprus government 
statement said the blast had nothing to do with the election 
The candidates agree on only one thing that the main issue is 
how to reunify the nation divided into Turkish and Greek sectors 
after Turkey invaded its northern third in 1974 
Dinos Michaelides the Interior minister said 95 percent of the 
362928 registered Greek Cypriot voters had cast their ballots when 
polling stations closed at 6 pm Voting is compulsory 
In previous presidential elections the result was always a 
foregone conclusion with the leading candidate either running 
unopposed or with insignificant opposition 
Since 1974 the northern third of the island has been under 
Turkish military control Turkey invaded Cyprus ostensibly to 
protect the Turkish Cypriot minority in the wake of a coup by 
Greek Cypriot extremists seeking union with Greece In 1983 the 
150000 Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own breakaway state 
which has been recognized only by Turkey 
A 2300man United Nations peacekeeping force patrols a dividing 
line splitting the island east to west Efforts at reunification 
through a UNsponsored federation plan have been deadlocked for 
more than two years 
Kyprianous main plank was the rejection of any resumption of 
negotiations with the Turkish side unless the 35000 Turkish troops 
and 65000 settlers from mainland Turkey withdraw from northern 
Cyprus 
His two main rivals also supported the withdrawal demand but did 
not make this a precondition for negotiations
