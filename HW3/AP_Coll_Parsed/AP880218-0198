The House on Wednesday balked at a Senate plan 
to outlaw dialaporn telephone services after some members raised 
constitutional questions and said they had a better way to keep 
children from calling 
The lawmakers voted 3820 to instruct negotiators on an omnibus 
education bill one that now includes the Senate ban to agree on 
new provisions aimed at solving the dialaporn problem short of an 
outright ban 
The alternative pressed by some conservatives would have been 
to instruct the negotiators to accept the ban But others argued it 
would be vulnerable to court challenges based on the right to free 
speech 
Rep Edward Markey DMass said the vote paved the way for a 
solution involving access codes that would prevent children from 
calling the pornographic toll numbers unless their subscriber 
parents gave them the code 
There is uniform concern in the House over this problem We 
want to get a bipartisan solution said Markey chairman of the 
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on communications 
Sponsors of the successful motion said they didnt want to take 
the risk that the negotiators would drop the whole issue because 
the Senate ban seemed unconstitutional And they said they didnt 
want the negotiators to accept a plan that would result in an 
immediate court challenge and injunction 
It would be litigated for years before we got a solution 
said Rep Thomas Bliley RVa And maybe we would get to one we 
sought and maybe we wouldnt 
Bliley said the purveyors of dialaporn might well go to court 
anyway even over access codes but their cases would be severely 
weakened without the First Amendment grounds 
Sen Jesse Helms RSC sponsored the dialaporn ban last 
December as an amendment to an education improvement act renewing 
and expanding federal programs for elementary and secondary school 
students 
The Senate approved the Helms measure 980 despite some 
senators reservations about its constitutionality and the American 
Civil Liberties Unions prediction that it would be challenged if 
it became law 
Rep John Dingell DMich chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and of the Houses negotiating team praised the House 
action Wednesday and promised that we will go as far as we can 
constitutionally to bring to a halt this obnoxious practice 
That was not enough for some conservatives who said neither 
children nor adults should have access to pornographic messages via 
their telephones 
We should be voting here today to eliminate dialaporn from 
the culture of America said Rep William Dannemeyer RCalif He 
tried and failed to win a vote on instructing the negotiators to 
accept the Senate ban
