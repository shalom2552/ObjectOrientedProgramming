The Iowa Supreme Court today said lower 
courts may authorize sterilization of mentally retarded people but 
refused to spell out guidelines under which the procedure is 
appropriate 
In a narrowly drawn opinion the justices agreed that courts can 
act on a request that mentally retarded people be sterilized even 
though a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977 
We conclude that our district courts possess subject matter 
jurisdiction over and accordingly may hear and determine 
applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentally 
incapacitated ward the high court said 
A stinging dissent said the court was wandering into a subject 
shot through with searching social and ethical questions 
In taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself to 
the eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendant 
social and ethical issues said Justice K David Harris Future 
litigants faced with unanswered questions of great social and 
ethical dimensions or with missing ingredients of a vague 
application process will continue to press us for determinations 
we are singularly unfit to reach 
But the majority rejected that reasoning 
Stated another way we do not believe our courts lack 
jurisdiction over a case merely because the case is important or 
unavoidably includes a constitutional dimension the court said 
The 71 decision came in a Polk County case in which Jan and 
Tekla Matejski are the legal guardians of their 33yearold 
mentally retarded daughter court records said 
The couple filed an application with a lower court seeking 
authorization to have their daughter sterilized but a lawyer 
appointed by the court to guard the womans rights objected 
claiming theres no provision in Iowa law allowing sterilization 
Polk County Judge Glenn E Pille agreed and dismissed the 
application 
Both sides appealed arguing over whether courts have the power 
to order sterilization but going one step further and asking the 
high court to set groundrules 
Lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the Legislature 
repealed a law providing for sterilization of people who are 
mentally ill or retarded syphilitic habitual criminals moral 
degenerates or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society 
But while agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests 
the high court refused to spell out guidelines 
We are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given the 
posture of the present case the court said The excursion 
suggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisory 
opinion 
Harris said the decision would haunt the justices 
At what level of mental retardation can sterilization be 
compelled Harris asked What board or body if any will 
suggest statewide standards
