Vice President George Bushs ties to the Reagan 
administraton and support among voters who chose a candidate at the 
last minute helped him recover from his Iowa debacle and win New 
Hampshires Republican primary polls said Tuesday 
Among the Democrats Michael Dukakis political organization and 
his performance as governor of neighboring Massachusetts helped 
bring about his strong primary victory the exit polls said 
While preelection polls had indicated an extremely tight race 
between Bush and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas 
voters who made up their minds in the final days of the New 
Hampshire race selected Bush pollsters said 
The polls had it neckandneck and Bush is winning by more 
than that said Jerry Strom a polling consultant for NBC News 
The reason is that the late deciders were going to Bush 
One possible reason was Bushs organization CBS News found 
there was a substantially higher proportion of Bush voters who had 
been contacted directly by the Bush campaign than Dole supporters 
who had heard from the senators campaign I think the thing that 
won it for Bush was his organization said Warren Mitofsky the 
CBS polling chief 
Bush after leading strongly in public opinion polls in New 
Hampshire saw his advantage melt away after he finished third in 
the Iowa caucuses Feb 8 beaten by Dole and former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson 
Late polls showed Bushs decline in New Hampshire halt one by 
CBS Sunday and Monday gave him a slim 4point lead over Dole We 
said he had a small lead and thats what it looks like said 
Mitofsky 
Los Angeles Times and the CBS NewsNew York Times polls found 
that Bushs government experience weighed in his favor A third of 
Republicans told CBS that experience was the most important factor 
in their vote and 54 percent of them voted for Bush to 37 percent 
for Dole 
Dole beat Bush among Republicans who said they were chiefly 
looking for a strong leader with 48 percent to 21 percent for 
Bush But that group made up a smaller share of the Republican 
vote 19 percent CBS reported 
The Los Angeles Times found that a sizable portion of 
Republicans in New Hampshire favored the Reagan administration 
more so than was the case among Iowa Republicans and they 
predomninantly supported Bush said Times polling chief IA Lewis 
People think of Bush as someone just representing whatever Reagan 
does and they like that Lewis said 
Identification with with the Reagan administration clearly 
helped Bush said Mitofsky of CBS Reagan is popular and the 
people who like Reagan went for Bush fairly strongly 
Moreover Bush is doing well because of his long and solid 
support here said Lewis He said his poll indicated that almost 
half of Bushs supporters decide last year to vote for the vice 
president 
But many final decisions were made virtually at the last minute 
Of just over 1000 Republicans surveyed by CBS as they left the 
polls 46 percent said they had decided on a candidate after the 
Iowa caucuses and 32 percent said they decided in the last three 
days of the campaign 
Strom said NBC found that voters who decided in the last few 
days went predominantly for Bush as did those who decided more 
than three weeks ago Bush was winning early and late and Dole 
was winning in the middle immediately after his Iowa victory 
Strom said 
NBCs poll found that 14 percent of the Republican voters made 
their final decision on primary day and they went for Bush 36 
percent to 29 percent for Dole Those who decided during the 
weekend 11 percent of the total by NBCs measure also went for 
Bush 44 percent to 31 percent for Dole 
NBC also found that one potential trouble area for Bush never 
developed While half the Republicans believed Bush knew more than 
he was saying about the IranContra affair only a fifth thought it 
mattered Strom said 
Decisions also were made late among Democrats 38 percent said 
they chose their candidate in the last three days Support for 
Dukakis was broad he won among liberals moderates and 
conservatives alike according to an ABC NewsWashington Post exit 
poll 
The CBS exit poll found that 42 percent of Dukakis supporters 
had been contacted by the governors campaign workers while the 
other campaigns contacted only a third of their voters 
It also found that 55 percent of the Democratic voters gave 
Dukakis and excellent or above average rating as governor of 
neighborhing Massachusetts and 59 percent of them voted for him 
The margin of sampling error for the polls was about 3 percent
