About 2000 supporters of impeached Gov 
Evan Mecham turned out to sing songs sign petitions and bash a car 
symbolizing his foes with sledgehammers Saturday at a fundraising 
picnic 
Mecham and his wife Florence wearing boots blue jeans and 
checked cowboy shirts with silver and turquoise bolo ties barely 
finished their meal before fans began lining up for hugs 
autographs and words of encouragement 
There were Mecham For President Tshirts and cassette tapes 
of his January 1987 inaugural address There were leaflets and 
former Mecham administration aides and an auction in which a bidder 
paid 15600 for the 20000 car that Mechams auto dealership had 
let Mecham drive as governor 
Mecham brought the crowd gathered at a park here to its feet 
with a prediction that he would prevail despite what he said was 
the unwillingness of his opponents to abide by the 1986 election 
results that saw him win a threeway race on his fifth try at 
governor 
You know in some countries theyd call it a coup he said 
But in this state its not going to work 
He added without my threatened veto youre going to get your 
taxes increased this year unless I get back there before the 
appropriations bill goes through 
Booths offered voters petitions to force recall elections on 
Mechams political opponents much as the Republican governors 
foes have forced one on him for May 17 if he survives impeachment 
and a criminal trial 
Supporters flocked to a battered Chevy Chevelle with the words 
Media Bias Special Interest Groups Hidden Government 
and Selective Prosecution painted on it 
For 1 they bought three whacks at their favorite target with a 
sledgehammer A stream of children and adults some in coats and 
ties kept up a steady rain of blows until the sledgehammer broke 
Additional hammers were found and the battering continued 
Tucson chef Greg Seader put huge dents in a panel labeled 
Media Bias As his wife Cheryl took her turn he said Too 
bad it wasnt a couple of reporters 
Don Ruzicka chairman of a Mecham support group known as 
Concerned Arizona Voters had already taken his whacks but said 
Oh I see what I want to hit and promptly ponied up another 
dollar 
I had a hard time choosing he said Im going to have to 
spend more money to hit all of them 
Organizers say they sold 3000 tickets at 25 each Actual 
turnout was estimated at 2000
