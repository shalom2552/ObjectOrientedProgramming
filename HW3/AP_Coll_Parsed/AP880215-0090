Mayor Maureen OConnor has accused FBI 
officials of trying to spoil her proposed Soviet arts festival with 
their suggestion that residents be wary of KGB spies in artists 
clothing 
Local FBI officials last week said they would encourage 
residents who take in Soviet house guests during the proposed 
monthlong cultural exchange to report any suspicious activity to 
the bureau 
Theyre just putting a big wet damper on it if thats what 
theyre saying said OConnor who is organizing the event for 
1989 or 1990 
The mayor said her office is working with the US State 
Department and the US Information Agency to arrange the exchange 
Agent Bob Harman said the FBI is worried the festival will lure 
spies bent on befriending and cultivating residents for espionage 
Our experience is that they the KGB use these cultural 
groups on a regular basis Harman said 
The FBI is particularly concerned about festival organizerss 
proposal to house Soviets with residents of San Diego he said 
San Diego is a natural espionage target because of its military 
base which includes the Miramar training facility for Navy pilots 
and many defense contractors FBI agents said 
Soviet diplomats are watched closely and are forced to follow 
their itinerary but tourists can travel at will 
With that dancer there very well may be someone standing 
around with no apparent purpose Harman said And if I were 
involved in hosting that group there might be a little funny 
feeling there that something isnt right 
Its that somethingisntrighthere feeling that we want 
people to call us about he said 
The mayor said she has discussed the festival with Soviet 
officials in San Francisco and will travel to Moscow this spring to 
set plans
