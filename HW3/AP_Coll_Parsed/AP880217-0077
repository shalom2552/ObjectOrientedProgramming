attacked an army patrol with stones and bottles said an officer in

Norway during World War II

Foreign Ministry and met with the ministrys political 
directorgeneral Yossi Beilin

resident was killed by a shot that pierced the heart The Palestine 
Press Service identified him as Ismail Mohammed Hussein

gunshot wounds in the legs and arms and four women for beating 
injuries 
One of the wounded Khaled Abu Rumei told The Associated Press 
from his hospital bed that soldiers had entered the village at 
about 5 am to round up suspected agitators 
They started breaking into houses and taking people away 
said Rumeis mother who would not give her first name She said 
soldiers clubbed her when she tried to stop them from detaining one

Sair the site of frequent antiIsraeli protests the army official 
said He said soldiers detained several residents but did not have 
further details 
During the meeting with the Norwegian ambssador Beilin 
expressed his sharp protest to Anda said Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ehud Gol 
The ambassador expressed regret that his words were understood 
in a way which has caused embarrassment Gol said 
Anda told Israel radio after the meeting that there was a 
misunderstanding that I wanted to compare these two regimes and 
Im very happy to have the opportunity to clarify 
Anda told reporters Tuesday that many Norwegians were comparing 
the conduct of the Israeli army to the behavior of Nazi troops who 
occupied Norway for five years during World War II 
What the Germans did including beating and torturing 
prisoners and suspects was very bad the Jerusalem Post 
newspaper quoted Anda as saying But we do not remember them 
going out into the streets to break peoples arms and legs or 
pulling children out of their homes at night 
The army today said seven Palestinians were wounded late Tuesday 
in clashes at the Fawwar refugee camp south of Hebron Aliya

Jenin hospital officials said The army confirmed one protester 
was wounded in Kabatiyeh

Israel was involved in bombing the ferry that was to carry 130 
deported Palestinians back to Israel The Palestine Liberation 
Organization which sponsored the voyage has accused Israel of 
responsibility for the bombing Monday at the port of Limassol 
Cyprus 
Corfu warned that if the PLO bought another ship for the trip 
its fate will be the same 
Speaking on Israel radio Tuesday Corfu said We knew we 
wouldnt allow the boat to reach Israel If we could prevent its 
departure that was obviously the right thing to do 
In Parliament Tuesday Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was 
questioned about his policy of beating Palestinians to stop riots 
He said the beating orders were necessary and to the best of my 
knowledge and judgment are legal 
Rabin said soldiers have exceeded orders in many cases and 
confirmed troops used a bulldozer earlier this month to bury alive 
four Arabs near Nablus The Arabs were saved by other Palestinians 
Maj Gen Ehud Barak deputy chief of staff said a 
sergeantmajor and a noncommissioned officer were detained in 
connection with the incident 
Barak said soldiers had no choice but to use beatings to try to 
curb nearly 2 months of riots in the occupied lands 
He said more than 200 Israelis had been injured most of them 
lightly and that 53 Arabs had been killed since disturbances began 
Dec 8 The United Nations puts the death toll at 54
