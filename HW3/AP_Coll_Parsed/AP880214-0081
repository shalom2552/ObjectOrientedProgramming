Lawyers for Gen Manuel Noriega said Sunday the 
Panamian strongman has dynamite information that could 
influence the US presidential election and they threatened to 
use the files if we have to 
We were given access by General Noriega to files which contain 
political dynamite files which could affect the upcoming 
presidential election in the United States and the positions of 
other nations Raymond Takiff said after arriving at Miami 
International Airport He refused to elaborate 
Right now were just going to sit tight with them the 
files If we have to use them well use them said Frank 
Rubino another defense lawyer later in response to a question 
Takiff added General Noriega told us that he has always been 
a friend of the United States and is still a friend of the United 
States 
Noriega was indicted on drug trafficking charges by federal 
grand juries in Miami and Tampa earlier this month 
Takiff Rubino and fellow lawyers Neal Sonnett and Steven Kollin 
conferred with their client Panamas de facto leader Friday 
Sonnett the former chief of the criminal division in the Miami 
US attorneys office and Kollin returned to Miami from Panama 
City on Saturday Takiff and Rubino returned Sunday 
The defense attorneys also have material which portrays the 
long and intricate involvement of Jose Blandon former Panamanian 
consul general in New York with the Communist Party in both Panama 
and Puerto Rico Takiff said 
Blandon was a witness before the Miami federal grand jury that 
indicted Noriega and has testified before a US congressional 
subcommittee about Noriegas alleged involvement in cocaine 
trafficking He also alleged that the CIA provided Noriega with 
confidential information on Sens Edward Kennedy and Jesse Helms 
which the CIA denied 
He Blandon wants to be the next president of Panama 
Takiff said 
Meanwhile Noriegas attorneys planned to meet with prosecutors 
on Tuesday but they declined to comment on the purpose of the 
meeting 
Sonnett plans to file motions this week in federal court asking 
for dismissal of the indictment as being politically motivated 
Takiff said He said he also will ask for the minutes of the grand 
jury 
Also this week law firms in Philadephia Washington and New 
York city are expected to be added to the defense team Takiff said
