Authorities said three suspects were in 
custody today in connection with an aborted attempt to assassinate 
President Amin Gemayel by planting a bomb in a plane he was to take 
to North Yemen and Sudan 
A police spokesman said the three were being held in solitary 
confinement pending completion of investigation 
The spokesman who cannot be identified in line with 
regulations refused to give the suspects names He only said they 
were all Lebanese airport employees 
A onepound charge of TNT was planted under the pilots seat of 
the Middle East Airlines Boeing 707 that had been scheduled to 
leave for Larnaca Cyprus Friday and later fly Gemayel to North 
Yemen 
The bomb was found and defused by explosives experts at Beirut 
airport 
Gemayel 44 left on another Middle East Arlines Boeing 707 
today 
The president usually travels by military helicopter from the 
Christian heartland northeast of Beirut to Larnaca and flies from 
there to world capitals 
Gemayel a Maronite Catholic has not used the Beirut airport in 
the citys western Moslem sector since 1984 when Moslem and 
leftist militias wrested control of the sector from the Lebanese 
army 
The airport is now currently controlled by Syrian troops who 
deployed in the western sector nearly a year ago in an effort to 
end three years of militia anarchy 
The police spokesman said the explosive charge was equipped with 
a sophisticated pressure fuse that would have detonated it when 
the plane reaches an altitude of 30000 feet 
This means that the bomb was designed to explode during the 
presidential flight from Larnaca to Sana when the plane usually 
flies at 30000 feet and more the spokesman said 
Planes during the 20minute trip from Beirut to Larnaca 
usually do not fly at an altitude of more than 10000 feet he 
said 
Lebanon has been plagued by assassinations car bombings and 
kidnappings since its MoslemChristian civil war broke out in 1975 
The conflict has claimed more than 130000 lives 
Moslem Prime Minister Rashid Karami was killed June 1 by a bomb 
planted in a Lebanese army helicopter that was flying him from 
north Lebanon to Beirut 
Moslem leaders blamed the assassination on the Lebanese Forces 
a rightwing Christian militia alliance and accused Gemayel of 
covering up for them 
Gemayels brother Bashir who led the Lebanese Forces was 
killed Sept 14 1982 in a bomb explosion at a political gathering a 
week before he was to take office as elected president of Lebanon 
Amin Gemayel was later elected president
