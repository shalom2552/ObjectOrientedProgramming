The parents of Challenger astronaut 
Judith Resnik said they have reached a multimilliondollar 
settlement with the manufacturer of the shuttles rocket booster 
over their daughters death 
The settlement completed Tuesday concluded a year of 
negotiations between MortonThiokol Inc and Marvin and Betty 
Resnik 
Resnik placed the mount at between 2 million and 35 million 
the range of settlements received by other families of the 
sevenmember crew killed in the Jan 28 1986 Challenger disaster 
The shuttle exploded 73 seconds after blastoff when a joint in 
its rightside booster leaked flame and ignited the shuttles giant 
fuel tank 
The settlement leaves one claim pending against MortonThiokol 
from the family of Challenger copilot Michael J Smith Resnik 
said 
Morton Thiokol spokesmen did not return a telephone call for 
comment Wednesday 
It was commensurate with what some of the others got from 2 
million to 35 million Resnik said of the settlement Its 
all settled thank God he added It wasnt what we wanted It 
was OK 
Smiths parents filed a 15 billion suit against the 
government MortonThiokol and Lawrence Mulloy director of the 
space agencys solid rocket booster program at the time of the 
accident 
A portion of the settlement will go to the Resniks two 
grandchildren and most of the rest will be placed in educational 
and scholarship funds established in Judith Resniks memory in Ohio 
and Maryland Resnik said
