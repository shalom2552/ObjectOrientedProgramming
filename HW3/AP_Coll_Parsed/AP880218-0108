Former Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt declaring 
I am free today abandoned his faltering campaign for the 
Democratic presidential nomination but vowed to carry on his fight 
for the politics of truth 
The first Democratic casualty of 1988 Babbitt said he was not 
ready to endorse any of the six Democrats still in the race 
After finishing fifth in Iowa and sixth in New Hampshire 
Babbitts campaign for the Democratic nomination clearly had no 
place to go 
At a news conference the former governor whose wit had drawn 
sympathetic coverage from the media said drew laughter when he 
said people had told him You fought a good fight you were in it 
right up to the beginning 
I dont know why we fared no better he went on Ill 
leave that for others to ponder 
Looking back on his campaign Babbitt said I cant say I 
loved every minute of it but I loved most of it 
He recalled the occasions during his campaign when he asked 
people to stand up if they supported his call for candor 
especially his advocacy of a national sales tax to help reduce the 
federal budget deficit 
Ill never forget the people in audience after audience who 
stood up out of their chair to join me in a demonstration of belief 
for the politics of truth he said 
I stood up for what I believed in he added They stood up 
for me Thats what this last year has been about Because a 
campaign is more than a candidate A cause is more than a campaign 
This candidate is withdrawing This campaign is closing down But 
the cause that it stood for has just begun 
In answering reporters questions Babbitt displayed the wit and 
selfdeprecating humor that characterized his campaign Asked if he 
would consider the vicepresidential spot he replied You 
probably ought to select a vicepresidential candidate from a state 
with more than seven electoral votes 
He added that if reincarnated he would try to be from the 
neighboring delegaterich state of Texas 
Asked how the generally favorable press coverage he received 
affected the race Babbitt joked You engaged in a deliberate 
conspiracy to destroy my candidacy by making me into kind of a 
house pet to destroy my credibility with the American people 
Addressing his party which has lost four of the last five 
presidential elections Babbitt said It is up to us to give our 
country a compelling reason to elect us to power 
Im going to wait and watch and do everything I can to insure 
the success of our party he said 
The 48yearold former Arizona governor spent Tuesday and 
Wednesday consulting friends supporters and family members about 
his decision which he planned to announce at a news conference 
today 
He said his two children urged him to stay in it as long as 
youve got half a chance while his wife Hattie contended 
conversely that timing and grace are a big part of life and 
politics 
Theres a point at which you just dont emulate Harold Stassen 
forever he added in reference to the perennial Republican 
presidential candidate from Minnesota 
Babbitt finished sixth out of a sevenman field on Tuesday in 
the New Hampshire primary garnering 5 percent of the vote Only 
former Sen Gary Hart of Colorado received less 
Babbitts campaign is broke and contributions slowed to a 
trickle after his fifthplace finish in last weeks Iowa caucuses 
where he had staked virtually all of his resources said campaign 
spokesman Vada Manager 
He said he would not endorse any of the other Democrats right 
away although Jesse Jackson has already sought his support 
And Hart urged him to stay in the contest when the two spoke 
Tuesday night Babbitt said 
He said Youve got something to say Youre a courageous 
guy Theres nothing shameful about losing 
Furthermore Babbitt said Hart noted that the large number of 
candidate debates this year allows them to have a platform without 
spending a lot of money 
Babbitt is about 150000 to 200000 in debt aides said 
Manager said donations slowed to a trickle after Babbitts poor 
showing in Iowa 
But money was not the main problem said Babbitt noting in his 
usual wry style A lot of my friends are saying the moneys never 
been a problem You never had any money so why should you get 
excited about not having any money now 
Babbitt approached his campaign with a nontraditional style 
from the beginning turning to unusual outdoor attentiongetters 
such as a bicycle ride across Iowa an ascent of Mt Washington in 
New Hampshire and a rugged crosscountry ski tour in northern 
Arizona 
He attracted favorable press reviews for his candor his wit 
and the depth of his economic proposals Babbitt often poked fun at 
himself and his low standing in the polls with such quips as 
Nobody ever told me I was going to be a frontrunner and so far I 
have fulfilled that expectation 
He said his New Hampshire loss was not surprising after the Iowa 
defeat but that he had hoped to get at least 10 percent of the 
vote 
Asked to explain what went wrong in his campaign which he 
launched last March 10 Babbitt said 
I would sum it up by saying this When you have a new 
messenger and a different and challenging message at the same time 
its a hard sell 
Babbitt left open the possibility he might take another shot at 
the presidency in 1992 
It was a great try and I dont regret a minute of it he 
said Who knows maybe Ill ride back into town again
