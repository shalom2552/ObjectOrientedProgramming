Johnson amp Johnson will significantly 
expand its market share in the tampon field with the acquisition of 
the maker of Playtex tampons analysts say 
On Tuesday Johnson amp Johnson said it has agreed to pay 726 
million for the Playtex Holding Co division that makes the tampons 
The addition of Playtex Family Products would give the health 
care giant more than 30 percent of the US tampon market of which 
it already has about 6 percent with the OB brand tampon one 
analyst said 
Johnson amp Johnson the leading manufacturer of sanitary napkins 
in the United States and Playtex said in a joint announcement that 
the transaction is still subject to government approval 
Playtex Family Products is one of three operating subsidiaries 
of Stamford Connbased Playtex Holdings itself once part of BCI 
Holdings Inc the company formed by the April 1986 leveraged 
buyout of Beatrice Cos 
The Family Products Divsion also makes disposable baby nursers 
household gloves and toothbrushes The division accounts for half 
the companys sales and 70 percent of its profits said Chairman 
Joel E Smilow 
The other two divisions are Playtex Jhirmack Inc maker of hair 
care products and Playtex Apparel a leading worldwide 
manufacturer of bras girdles and pantyhose 
Proceeds from the sale of the Family Products Division would go 
towards paying off debt incurred in the December 1986 leveraged 
buyout of Playtex from BCI said Smilow who had been chairman of 
BCIs consumer products division 
He said the Jhirmack division would likely go on the selling 
block next week The divestments would allow Playtex to concentrate 
on its intimate apparel lines Smilow said 
The apparel division last year had operating profits of 45 
million on sales of 300 million 
Analyst Lucy Olwell of Merrill Lynch in New York estimated sales 
from Playtex tampons at 125 million or about 25 percent of the 
more than 500 million domestic tampon market and sales from the 
other family products lines at about 100 million 
Tambrands Tampex line is the market leader with 55 percent she 
said 
Johnson amp Johnsons more than onethird of the sanitary napkin 
market should give it leverage in finding shelf and distribution 
space for the Playtex line said Ms Olwell Its experience in 
feminine hygiene products should also allow for cost savings
