President Kurt Waldheim today defied 
widespread calls to resign because of his wartime past and vowed 
not to retreat before slanders hateful demonstrations and 
wholesale condemnations 
His decision announced in a prepared text for a nationally 
televised speech seemed certain to deepen Austrias growing 
political crisis 
The 69yearold president was addressing the fierce controversy 
that reached flashpoint last week when a historians report 
questioned Waldheims moral integrity and said he was in close 
proximity to Nazi atrocities during his World War II service in 
the Balkans 
Today Waldheim declared I cannot but state that parts of the 
report do not correspond to the facts but are built on presumptions 
and hypotheses For that reason the conclusions drawn cannot be 
upheld 
Waldheim stressed that he will cling to his embattled presidency 
despite calls from across the political spectrum that he should 
step down 
In the course of the renewed discussion the question was also 
put about my premature departure from the office of federal 
president Waldheim said 
I want to take a stand in all clarity You my dear Austrians 
have elected me federal president with a convincing majority in a 
secret and direct election for six years 
Thus it is no longer a matter of the man Kurt Waldheim 
Waldheim ruled out resignation saying It is a fundamental 
principle of our democracy that an election result cannot be 
subsequently corrected 
A head of state must not retreat in the face of slanders 
hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations he said 
Earlier today Alois Mock the foreign minister and chairman of 
the conservative Peoples Party reiterated his support for the 
president as some other conservatives appeared to back away from 
Waldheim 
On Sunday Socialist Chancellor Franz Vranitzky sharply 
criticized Waldheim in a televised interview and made it clear the 
controversy was threatening the government coalition between 
Socialists and conservatives 
Vranitzky runs the government in Austria while the presidency 
is a largely ceremonial post The Socialists are the senior partner 
in the coalition government with the conservative Austrian Peoples 
Party which backed Waldheim when he won the presidency in 1986 
Vranitzky said he himself would consider resigning if his 
leadership continued to be affected by the controversy over 
Waldheim 
The chancellor won rare praise from some conservatives for what 
the generally proWaldheim tabloid Kurier called a great moment 
of television 
Vranitzky has made a huge gamble the tabloid added 
Robert Graf a top conservative politician and economics 
minister voiced impatience over Waldheims failure to act 
The president must take a decision which is very important for 
our country Graf emphasized in an Austrian radio interview 
Graf who represents influential conservative business 
interests said he was concerned about Austrias battered image 
abroad and had no idea how to get out of the crisis 
The 202page historians document suggested there was no proof 
that Waldheim took part in war crimes while with the German army 
but said he had made every effort to conceal his wartime past until 
his Balkans service was first disclosed in March 1986 
The report commissioned by the government at Waldheims 
request also seriously questioned Waldheims moral integrity as a 
lieutenant in the German army in Yugoslavia and Greece 
About 1500 Austrians including the nations most prominent 
intellectuals signed a threepage advertisement in the news weekly 
Profil demanding Waldheims resignation About 5000 Waldheim 
opponents staged a demonstration in downtown Vienna 
On Sunday Vranitzky questioned Waldheims ability to perform 
his duties saying the federal president must be an integration 
figure not a disintegration figure 
On Friday former Foreign Minister Karl Gruber stirred outrage 
by claiming that members of the commission were Waldheims enemies 
because they were either socialists or Jews 
Referring to Grubers statement Vranitzky said The president 
must in the very next hour distance himself from such statements as 
Grubers and not wait until the chancellor sends a public apology 
and other officials express their dismay 
In an interview with the Kurier Waldheim belatedly described 
Grubers comments as unacceptable but he qualified his remarks 
by saying Gruber was a resistance fighter I believe he did not 
want to express an evil sense 
The commission of historians was appointed to investigate 
Waldheims wartime record after the US government put him on a 
list of undesirable aliens which effectively bars him from 
entering the United States 
US officials said Waldheim was a lieutenant in a German unit 
that sent thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps The charges 
originating with the World Jewish Congress had first surfaced 
during Waldheims candidacy
