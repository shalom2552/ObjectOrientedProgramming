EDITORS NOTE When presidential aspirant Joseph Biden was 
caught in rhetorical plumage borrowed from a British politician an 
uproar ensued But how many candidates or other movers and shakers 
write their own speeches and quip their own quips Their eloquence 
is manufactured by selfeffacing anonymous ghosts who work 
overtime in an election year

No one Walter Lippman said can write 
an authentic speech for another man It is as impossible as writing 
his love letters for him or saying his prayers for him 
When he speaks to the people he and not someone else must 
speak For it is much more important that he is genuinethan that 
he be bright clever ingenious entertaining eloquent or even 
grammatical 
No specialized talent is required Lippman said Anyone who 
knows what he is doing can say what he is doing and anyone who 
knows what he thinks can say what he thinks 
Lippman was an important columnist whose judgments were closely 
attended by presidents tycoons and other pillars of power But on 
the matter of speech writing no oracle was ever more widely 
ignored then or now 
Especially now an election year when the full monsoon is upon 
us Never were more people cleaving the air with more speeches 
written by other people 
In the stupefying war of words 12 of the 13 original candidates 
for president used at least one mercenary each as do most 
senators representatives governors mayors bank presidents 
tycoons and assistant tycoons Humble Gary Hart has no speech 
writer 
The Super Bowl of course is the White House where President 
Reagan has five fulltime writers four researchers and assorted 
freelance specialists to help him with a portentous speech on the 
crisis in Iran or Wall Street with a oneliner for reporters a 
tidbit for a teteatete with visting royalty in the Rose Garden 
an inspiring sermon on the State of the Union taped birthday 
greetings for Jimmy Stewart a proclamation summoning the attention 
of his countrymen to Dairy Goat Awareness Week 
For three days of summitry with Mikhail Gorbachev the boys in 
the back room provided the Great Communicator with warm words of 
welcome and farewell one treaty signing statement one evening 
broadcast two dinner toasts and nine Russian proverbs for targets 
of opportunity He used seven 
Cooling or thawing the Cold War is fought with the menace of 
vast armadas of planes aircraft carriers submarines guided 
missiles nuclear bombs and speech writers 
Ted Sorensen wrote for John Kennedy Fyodor Burlatsky wrote for 
Nikita Khrushchev They met for the first time in New York two 
years ago 
In effect we have met before said Burlatsky We have 
corresponded 
Really 
You helped write President Kennedys messages during the 
missile crisis I helped write Chairman Khrushchevs answers 
Eyeball to eyeball typewriter to typewriter the twain met 
William Safire wrote for Richard Nixon Georgy Kornienko wrote 
for Leonid Brezhnev In 1972 in the Great Hall of the Kremlin 
after the signing of the first treaty limiting strategic weapons 
the writers sat side by side basking in the warm glow of the toasts 
they had written for the two world leaders 
Kornienko particularly basked during Brezhnevs delivery of 
his toast 
Can you not hear the steps of history going by us he 
whispered to Safire ghost to ghost 
The example may be Russian rococo but it is history they say 
that lures perspiring writers to aspiring presidents The chance 
that one day their words may soar out of the Oval Office or a joint 
session of Congress is the fuel propelling most of the 
practitioners now pounding typewriters in planes trains buses 
cars motel rooms bathrooms and the dank wings of theaters The 
hope of marble sustains them in their frantic anonymity 
Ever after their words become history a curious honor code 
prevails among presidential speech writers Even at this late date 
neither Clark Clifford nor Ted Sorensen will tell you which golden 
phrases he crafted for Harry Truman or John Kennedy It was years 
before we learned that honest George Washington got help on his 
farewell address from three ghosts named Madison Jefferson and 
Hamilton 
Safire and Pat Buchanan reveal nothing about the language they 
supplied Nixon or Reagan but on a vice presidential level they 
have confessed their connection with the pusillanimous 
pussyfooters and nattering nabobs of negativism immortalized 
by Spiro Agnew 
Among Jimmy Carters writers the vow of silence was 
particularly easy to observe after his speech before a 
distinguished audience in Mexico City None was tempted to rush 
forward to claim authorship of his jocular remarks about jogging in 
Mexico because of Montezumas revenge 
Besides his humor Carters writers worried about twists of his 
tongue To their horror in a major speech they heard him identify 
a huge block of voters as eyetalians and one of the partys 
saints as Hubert Horatio Hornblower nee Humphrey Gerald 
Fords writers tried to keep him away from judgment which he 
insisted on making judgament 
Reagans writers luxuriate in his masterful delivery of their 
lines but their ulcers stir when he strays from the text At such 
times he has been known to come up with a statistic or item 
unchecked by White House researchers which later requires 
correction This president literally saves his own supply of speech 
goodies in a shoe box 
Sen Robert Doles staff worries most about his wit which seems 
clearly the best among the candidates but unreined lunges for the 
jugular George Bushs two writers tense up when he adlibs 
something folksy Trying to explain why he did poorly in an Iowa 
straw poll the vice president said his supporters were probably 
busy that day with other things like a daughters coming out 
party This in a state gloomy with farm foreclosures
