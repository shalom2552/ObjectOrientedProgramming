The PLO today threatened to attack 
Israeli targets around the world to avenge the killing of three 
guerrilla commanders and the bombing of a ferry being readied for a 
protest voyage by Palestinian deportees 
The Palestine Liberation Organization has blamed Israel for the 
slayings on Sunday and the explosion aboard the Sol Phryne ferry on 
Monday 
Israel knows that the PLO is not handcuffed The blood of 
our martyrs will not go unavenged said a statement issued in 
Nicosia 
The PLO officers Col Marwan Kayyali Lt Col Mohammed Sultan 
and Lt Col Mohammed Buheis were killed in a car bombing in 
Limassol on Cyprus southern coast apparently after arranging the 
sale of the Cypriot ship to a PLOaffiliated firm for the socalled 
Ship of Return voyage to Israel 
We had adhered to the Cairo Declaration to halt military 
operations against enemy targets outside the borders of our country 
Israel the statement said It is not logical or possible for 
the halt to continue unilaterally This is a doubleedged weapon 
it added 
PLO chief Yasser Arafat declared during a visit to the Egyptian 
capital of Cairo in 1985 that his guerrillas would restrict their 
attacks in the ArabIsraeli conflict to targets inside Israel and 
halt terrorist attacks on Israelis abroad a policy the PLO had 
pursued since Arafat took over its leadership in 1969 
An official at the PLO office in Nicosia said today There are 
alternatives We are not desperate when asked what the PLO 
planned to do after the explosion that crippled the Sol Phryne 
The official who spoke on condition of anonymity would not say 
whether the PLO has found another boat to charter for the 130 
deportees and hundreds of sympathizers and reporters who planned to 
go on the voyage to protest the deportation of Palestinians from 
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
The PLO had tried to launch the voyage from Greece but it was 
repeatedly delayed reportedly under Israeli pressure 
The deportees sympathizers and reporters were taken in buses to 
Athens airport Monday and were told they would be flown to Cyprus 
to board the boat After news of the blast reached Athens most 
returned to their hotels 
Another PLO official in Nicosia had disclosed that the 
40yearold ferry which was sold Saturday only a few days before 
it was to be auctioned had a hole blown in it by an underwater 
blast caused by a mine that was stuck probably by frogmen onto 
the vessel It was attached to a time fuse 
The boat was supposed to sail to the Israeli port of Haifa but 
Israeli officials have said they will refuse to let the vessel 
enter their waters 
The planned voyage resembles in some ways the 1947 trip of the 
Exodus in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned 
back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to Palestine 
In Athens Bassam Abu Sharif the PLOs chief spokesman who has 
been overseeing preparations for the voyage said on Monday We 
are continuing our plans and we will sail in spite of Israeli 
terrorists who are using bombs against ideas noble ideas 
Fouad alBittar the PLO diplomatic representative in Athens 
said The damage to the ferry is not very severe 
But the ships captain Cleanthis Vlahopoulos said it would 
take several months to make the Sol Phryne seaworthy again 
A man claiming to speak for the Jewish Defense League on Monday 
said the USbased extremist group was responsible for the device 
that planted the 6151ton Sol Phryne 
The JDL is responsible for the bombing at Limassol he said 
This is only a warning Next time we will bomb it with all the 
people on it 
The man made the claim in a telephone call to The Associated 
Press but there was no way to authenticate it or verify the 
callers identity 
He said no comment when asked if the JDL also was behind the 
car bombing that killed the PLO officials Snday 
The JDL advocates use of violence in the ArabIsraeli conflict 
It was founded in the early 1960s by New Yorkborn Meir Kahane now 
a member of Israels Parliament and head of extremist antiArab 
Kach Party 
The head of the Jewish Defense League Irv Rubin told The AP in 
a telephone interview on Monday from Los Angeles that JDL was not 
involved
