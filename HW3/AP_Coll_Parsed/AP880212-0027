Sen Bob Doles presidential campaign is 
wasting no time in trying to lure national convention delegates 
away from Vice President George Bush even though only a handful 
have been chosen so far 
Doles Pennsylvania campaign has gone to work on at least some 
of the 18 delegates who were chosen there last week by the 
Republican State Committee and so far one delegate has been 
enticed to defect while another is complaining of being harassed 
Theyre after me Grace Jesberger said Friday in a telephone 
interview from from Ridgway Pa Im just getting a little miffed 
that people are trying to pressure me 
The effort has intensified since Bushs thirdplace finish in 
the Iowa caucuses but Francis Shane who leads Doles Pennsylvania 
campaign said nobodys trying to twist arms 
Since Iowa were getting calls from people rethinking their 
positions he said 
Dole spokeswoman Katie Boyle said Jesberger had been persuaded 
to switch support to the Senate minority leader but Jesberger 
herself said thats not true 
Jesberger said she has often indicated that she has no 
problems with Dole But she said she was sticking with Bush at 
least for now because he is the best qualified candidate 
However Doles campaign did succeed in winning over Ronald 
Reese an insurance adjuster from Philadelphia who was a member of 
Bushs state steering committee 
Reese did not return calls to his office or home Friday but he 
told The Pittsburgh Press that he left the Bush campaign in part 
because it was not paying enough attention to black Republicans 
His defection brought the national delegate count to 46 for Bush 
and 35 for Dole Rep Jack Kemp has 32 delegates former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson 8 and another 8 remain uncommitted There 
are still 2148 Republican delegates to be chosen
