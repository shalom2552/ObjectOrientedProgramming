A grand jury investigating the IranContra 
affair again heard testimony from Attorney General Edwin Meese III 
after appearances in recent weeks from other members of Meeses 
staff 
Meeses appearance Wednesday before the grand jury was his 
seventh The panel is believed to be focusing on Meeses Nov 
2223 1986 investigation that uncovered the diversion of 
armssale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels 
The attorney general has refused to comment on his grand jury 
appearances but the Justice Department says he is cooperating with 
the investigation being conducted by independent counsel Lawrence 
E Walsh and is not a target 
The grand jury recently heard testimony by Assistant Attorney 
General William Bradford Reynolds who found a memo revealing the 
diversion in National Security Council files and Assistant 
Attorney General Charles J Cooper another member of the team 
Former White House chief of staff Donald T Regan who was 
present when President Reagan ordered Meese to conduct the 
investigation and when the attorney general reported his findings 
has also testified recently 
Meeses investigation was criticized by congressional committees 
that held hearings last summer on the IranContra affair The 
panels faulted Meese for not recruiting Justice Department lawyers 
with more experience investigating criminal cases and for failing 
to take notes during interviews with top administration officials 
after he learned about the diversion 
The congressional committees said Meeses failure to secure 
National Security Council files allowed documents to be shredded by 
thennational security adviser John M Poindexter NSC aide Lt 
Col Oliver L North and others 
Poindexter resigned and North was fired after Meese announced 
that armssale profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels 
Poindexter and North are targets of the Walsh investigation 
Indictments are expected to be returned in the coming weeks 
Meese also has testified six other times before a different 
grand jury investigating his financial dealings with a former 
officer of the scandalplagued Wedtech Corp
