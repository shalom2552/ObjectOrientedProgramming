Some law enforcement and other government 
officials are challenging the credibility of witnesses who gave the 
Senate a startling detailed account of ties between Latin American 
leaders and a huge Colombian drug cartel 
But the two senators who ran last weeks hearings Massachusetts 
Democrat John Kerry and New York Republican Alfonse DAmato are 
unbowed by the criticism and promise more revelations to come 
When youre trying to prosecute the devil said Kerry 
referring to Panamanian strongman Manual Noriega you dont go to 
heaven for the witnesses 
Though Noriega who denies all charges is under federal 
drugtrafficking indictments in Miami and Tampa and the 
administration has distanced itself from its onetime ally some 
officials are challenging parts of the Senate testimony as 
undocumented and tainted by the criminal background of key 
witnesses 
The critics include Vice President George Bush officials of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration the US attorney in Miami and 
Democrat David Boren chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee 
Kerry is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee 
on terrorism and narcotics which has spent the past year 
investigating ties among Latin American leaders and drug kingpins 
in Colombia 
Last weeks hearings produced dramatic testimony from Jose I 
Blandon a former close associate of Noriega who was fired last 
month and Ramon Milian Rodriguez an accountant who is serving a 
43year prison term for laundering money for the drug cartel 
At one point Blandon said the CIA had provided Noriega with 
details about the personal lives of US senators 
The CIA categorically denied that assertion Boren traveling in 
Europe said he had no reason to believe that there is any 
truth to the charge 
Kerry said Blandon was a very credible witness I havent 
talked yet to Sen Boren about his statement but I intend to when 
he returns from Europe 
DAmato who has been interested for years in the way drugs 
reach the United States sided with Kerry Blandon is credible 
DAmato said I dont know about the truth of every single 
statement he made but an awful lot of what he said can be checked 
out and has been fully checked out 
Blandon also said that two hours before the US invasion of 
Grenada on Oct 25 1983 Bush passed a warning to Cuban president 
Fidel Castro that Cuban troops shouldnt oppose the US action on 
the Caribbean island 
Bush said hed never given such a warning 
Rodriguez testified about the money laundering operations of the 
drug cartel based in Medellin Colombia He asserted that the 
cartel had helped bankroll the USbacked Nicaraguan rebels and 
also said he received money from the CIA 
Echoing complaints of federal drug agents Richard Gregory 
chief deputy US attorney in Miami said When Rodriguez was 
arrested in 1983 he never told us any of the things hes talking 
about now Ive talked to the agents in this office who worked on 
his case and they dont believe him Every time anything reached 
headline status in the last five years hed say he knew about it 
When US Attorney Leon Kellner sought the indictment in Miami 
against Noriega returned two weeks ago Rodriguez wasnt used 
Gregory said 
Gregory also said investigators from Kerrys subcommittee were 
told that Rodriguez wasnt credible but Kerry used him anyway 
You know said Kerry if you go back to the IranContra 
hearings there were witnesses who came forward with totally 
different stories totally inconsistent with each other day after 
day That has not appeared here Witness after witness has 
corroborated the money laundering corroborated the drug network 
corroborated the names 
Kerry added that I certainly dont quickly forget the fact 
that there were long and indignant and repeated denials by the 
White House and others about selling arms to Iran There were long 
and repeated denials by the CIA and State Department about those 
and many other things including illegal support of the Contras 
DAmato agreed A lot of people dont want to believe the 
things that Blandon and Rodriguez are saying so their credibility 
is attacked he said But if you look at it very closely an 
awful lot of what they are saying has been corroborated by 
documentation by statements from other people The international 
drug trafficking problem is very serious and it wont go away by 
attacking someones credibility 
When the hearings resume next month Kerry says he plans to 
focus on the alleged connections among the drug cartel the Contras 
and the CIA
