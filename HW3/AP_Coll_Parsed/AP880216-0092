Ukrainian Communist Party leader Vladimir V 
Shcherbitsky has been awarded the Soviet Unions highest civilian 
honor the Order of Lenin in honor of his 70th birthday the Tass 
news agency said Tuesday 
Announcement of the award appeared to solidify the position of 
Shcherbitsky long rumored to be in trouble with Mikhail S 
Gorbachevs reformminded leadership one day before a plenary 
meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee 
The policymaking Central Committee is the only group empowered 
to make changes in the ruling Politburo Shcherbitsky has been a 
full member of the ruling body since 1971 
Shcherbitsky and his Ukrainian party organization have come in 
for sharp criticism for failing to meet targets for industrial and 
farm production In a Jan 26 report the Communist Party newspaper 
Pravda said a meeting of top Ukrainian party officials criticized 
Shcherbitsky and other top officials by name 
It said local officials receive too many directives from the 
top even though central authorities are inefficient and seem to 
not have worked out a general development plan for the republic 
Shcherbitsky has survived other criticism and predictions that 
he was about to be ousted perhaps indicating that Gorbachev does 
not have the strength to replace him or does not want to risk 
alienating Ukrainians
