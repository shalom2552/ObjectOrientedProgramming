Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael 
Dukakis leave New Hampshire today with a slight bump in their 
delegate totals that keeps them both on top in the race for their 
parties presidential nominations 
But the lift from the early primaries and caucuses is more 
psychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1139 
delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination or 
the 2082 delegates for the Democratic nomination 
Vice President Bush who picked up 38 percent of the Republican 
vote in Tuesdays primary gained 11 of New Hampshires 23 
delegates to the GOP National Convention In all Bush now has 61 
delegates 
Dukakis who got 36 percent of the Democratic vote in the 
primary won 9 of the states 18 pledged delegates to that national 
convention The Massachusetts governor has 445 delegates 
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas gained 7 delegates 
in New Hampshire to bring his national total to 42 while Rep Jack 
Kemp of New York won 3 delegates to raise his total to 35 
Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri the winner of last weeks 
Iowa Democratic caucuses gained 6 national convention delegates 
for his secondplace showing in New Hampshire and Sen Paul Simon 
of Illinois followed with 3 delegates In the popular vote in New 
Hampshire Gephardt won 20 percent while Simon had 17 percent 
Gephardt now has 39 delegates while Simon has 33 
Under Democratic Party rules the national convention delegates 
were awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15 
percent of the vote In effect that disqualified Jesse Jackson 
Sen Albert Gore of Tennessee former Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt 
and former Colorado Sen Gary Hart from receiving any delegates 
from New Hampshire 
Jackson won 8 percent of the vote Gore 7 percent Babbitt 5 
percent and Hart 4 percent 
New Hampshire Republicans have a similar rule but the threshold 
is 10 percent That meant former Delaware Gov Pete du Pont who 
had 101 percent picked up 2 delegates but former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson who was within 1100 votes of du Pont 
received no delegates because he had just 95 percent of the vote 
Robertson already had 8 delegates while du Pont had none before 
Tuesdays primary 
Among the Democrats Gore already had 1055 delegates Jackson 
had 98 and Babbitt had 4 
The delegate totals for the Republicans include results from 
Michigan Kansas Pennsylvania New Hampshire and Guam Although 
Iowa and Hawaii both have held GOP caucuses precise delegate 
figures cannot be calculated until later because of the way the 
selection process is structured 
The Democratic totals include results from Iowa and New 
Hampshire as well as an Associated Press survey of Democratic 
governors and Democratic National Committee members who will serve 
automatically as delegates to their partys convention Some of the 
Democratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention
