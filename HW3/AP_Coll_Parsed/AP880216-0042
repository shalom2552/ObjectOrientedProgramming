About 15 parents and community activists seized 
an elementary school classroom to protest the transfer of a 
teacher and three parents were arrested in a demonstration one 
protester called a great civics lesson 
Parents blocked the door to a room at Brentano Elementary School 
on Monday while the thirdgrade teacher and about 30 students were 
inside They refused to let the new teacher enter to show that 
sometimes you have to stand up against those kind of policies that 
hurt people said the Rev Bruce Rickley one of the protesters 
After a sixhour impasse the three parents were arrested and 
charged with criminal trespass a misdemeanor before they were 
released on their own recognizance said police officer John Lyons 
The other parents dispersed 
They could go to jail up to a year for it It is one thing to 
protest it is another thing to deter the operation of a school 
Lyons said 
The transferred teacher Louise DeGroot had taught the children 
since the beginning of the school year but was not yet certified 
she said School officials considered her a substitute teacher 
When a teacher at another school received certification the two 
were directed to switch classrooms as of Monday But Ms DeGroot 
showed up Monday in her old classroom to protest 
Ms DeGroot 40 said she hopes the protest will persuade the 
school board to put her back in her classroom but she realizes it 
may jeopardize her future as a teacher in Chicagos schools 
Ms DeGroot was told she was being transferred Thursday after 
school was over and since Friday was a school holiday she said 
had no chance to say goodbye to her pupils 
Children become very attached with a teacher so it is very 
traumatic for them Its very traumatic for me too Ms DeGroot 
said in a telephone interview Monday night 
The protesters met Monday night and decided to start picketing 
in front of the school this morning Ms DeGroot said 
A teacher is not something to be ripped away from them without 
a chance to say goodbye said Rickley whose three children 
attend another school 
Most of the students who were in the room when it was seized 
about 9 am Monday were removed and assigned to other classrooms 
after police arrived an hour later said Aracelis Figueroa a 
district superintendent for the city Board of Education Four 
students whose parents were involved in the protest remained in the 
room throughout the daylong demonstration she said 
We figured this kind of thing was a great civics lesson 
Rickley said 
Removing their teacher was something the children understood 
as very unfair said Rickley who knows Ms DeGroot from North 
River Community Church the Baptist church where he preaches 
Ms Figueroa said Ms DeGroot wants to be placed back at 
Brentano but there is no such thing as assigning anyone 
permanently to a school as a substitute 
A substitute is just a substitute Ms Figueroa said
