A white man accused of threatening blacks with a 
baseball bat and yelling racial slurs would be ordered to work for 
the NAACP under a proposed sentencing agreement 
I think working 200 hours for the NAACP is certainly going to 
teach him something Cook County Judge Stuart Nudelman said 
Hes going to learn how to be a responsible human being 
James Kalafut 22 is charged with aggravated assault and ethnic 
intimidation He is accused of joining a group of six whites and 
Hispanics who brandished baseball bats and threw bottles as they 
chased two blacks from a transit stop last August 
Neither black was injured police said 
Nudelman said he plans to sentence Kalafut Feb 23 Officials of 
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 
could reject the courtarranged agreement after interviewing 
Kalafut 
Kalafuts lawyer Barry Silver said his client will accept the 
agreement to perform community service work for the NAACP If the 
agreement falls through Kalafut would stand trial and would face 
up to a year in jail on each charge if convicted 
The sentencing is a very good move by the judge to help the 
young man remove a prejudice Silver said It is a terrific 
idea it lets the punishment fit the crime 
Perhaps with his gang he could be a terror but when he has to 
survive in the middle of the black community he might have a whole 
different presence said Edward McClellan executive secretary of 
an NAACP branch on the South Side 
If theres a new way to deal with old kinds of problems why 
shouldnt we interact he said 
Still McClellan said he wants to interview Kalafut to gauge 
his attitude about the sentence If it is not constructive in 
nature then I give him back to the judge he said 
Kalafuts teenage brother Larry was sentenced last March to 
six years in prison for firebombing the home of a black family who 
moved into Gage Park a predominantly white neighborhood
