Black activist Virgil Hawkins who waged a 
28year battle to practice law in Florida and helped break the 
color barrier at the University of Florida Law School died after a 
lengthy illness He was 81 
Hawkins had been in poor health for several months He died 
Thursday at Munroe Regional Medical Center in Ocala after suffering 
acute kidney failure his wife Ida said Saturday 
Hawkins who was born in Okahumpka near Leesburg taught school 
and was a principal in Lake County schools in the 1940s after 
graduating from BethuneCookman College in Daytona Beach 
In 1949 at the age of 41 he applied for admission to the 
allwhite law school at the University of Florida in Gainesville 
and was rejected because he was black 
Hawkins challenged the states segregated school system and in 
1956 the US Supreme Court ruled that he should be admitted to the 
school 
But the Florida Supreme Court invoked states rights to deny him 
admission and the states Board of Control then adopted rigid 
entrance requirements that made it impossible for Hawkins to enroll 
even if he won court approval 
In 1976 the Florida Bar urged the state Supreme Court to allow 
Hawkins to take the state bar examination even though he had 
attended an unaccredited law school in Massachusetts 20 years 
earlier The Bar said he should be given special consideration 
because of his ill treatment while trying to enter law school in 
1949 
In November 1976 the Florida Supreme Court ruled 70 that 
Hawkins should be allowed to practice law and waived a requirement 
that he first take the bar exam 
After a 28year fight Hawkins opened his law practice in a tiny 
office off Main Street in downtown Leesburg 
But at the age of 77 he found himself before the state Supreme 
Court again in November 1983 because of complaints about his legal 
competence and allegations that he misappropriated 15000 
entrusted to him by a client 
In January 1984 the Florida Supreme Court censured Hawkins and 
placed him on probation for two years because of errors he made in 
his first cases 
Hawkins facing two additional complaints was allowed to resign 
from the Florida Bar in April 1985
