Richard P Feynman the brilliant 
mischievous physicist who called his Nobel Prize a pain in the 
neck and helped shatter NASAs claim that cold weather didnt 
doom the shuttle Challenger has died of cancer at the age of 69 
The theoretical physicist who also helped develop the atomic 
bomb during the Manhattan Project of World War II died Monday 
night at UCLA Medical Center after an eightyear battle with 
abdominal cancer said hospital spokesman Rich Elbaum said 
The California Institute of Technology professor was noted for 
his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles his provocative 
mischievousness his indignant impatience with pretension and 
hypocrisy and his talent for oneupping anybody who tries to 
oneup him Al Hibbs a former student and NASA scientist said 
in the introduction to the bestselling 1985 autobiography Surely 
Youre Joking Mr Feynman 
It was certainly in character for Feynman to conduct an 
impromptu experiment as a member of the presidential commission 
that investigated the Jan 28 1986 explosion of the shuttle 
Challenger in which all seven crew members died 
Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
initially played down any possibility that cold weather impaired 
the resiliency of Oring seals on the shuttles booster rockets 
thus allowing burning fuel to erode through the rings to cause the 
fatal blast 
But at a recess during the comissions hearings in February 
1986 Feynman showed Oring resiliency was sharply reduced by cold 
He compressed a piece of rubberlike Oring material with a simple 
clamp dropped it into a glass of ice water pulled it out and 
released the Oring piece demonstrating that it lacked any 
resiliency for a few seconds 
I believe this has some significance for our problem he 
said 
The commission agreed in its final report concluding Floridas 
prelaunch freeze contributed to an Oring failure that caused the 
accident 
Feynman also wrote an appendix to the commissions final report 
accusing NASA of playing Russian roulette with the shuttle fleet 
and astronauts lives and of exaggerating the rockets safety to 
the point of fantasy 
Born in New York City on May 11 1918 Feynman started learning 
mathematics while still in his high chair He earned a degree from 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1939 then earned a 
doctorate at Princeton University in 1942 After working on the 
Manhattan Project he moved in 1945 to Cornell University where he 
did his Nobelwinning studies then moved to Caltech in Pasadena in 
1950 
In 1965 Feynman shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Julian 
S Schwinger and Shinichero Tomonaga for developing an improved 
theory of quantum electrodynamics The theory allowed scientists to 
predict the effects of electrically charged particles on each other 
in a radiation field 
The truth was I didnt really want this prize Feynman said 
in his autobiography explaining how the recognition disrupted his 
privacy and his life 
Its nice that I got some money I was able to buy a beach 
house but altogether I think it would have been much nicer not 
to have had the Prize because you never any longer can be taken 
straightforwardly in any public situation he wrote In a way 
the Nobel Prize has been something of a pain in the neck 
Feynman often refused to explain his prizewinning work once 
declaring Hell if I could explain it to the average person it 
wouldnt have been worth the Nobel Prize 
Cornell University Professor Hans Bethe a former colleague 
there and on the Manhattan Project called Feynman the greatest 
theoretical physicist in the United States after World War II 
Feynman was not an ordinary genius He was a magician said 
Bethe who himself received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1967 
Nobody could have done what he did 
Marvin Goldberger director of the Institute for Advanced Study 
in Princeton NJ and a former Caltech president called Feynman 
a towering figure in 20th century physics who was always 
curious always modest always ebullient always willing to share 
his deep insights with students and colleagues 
Yet Feynman took pleasure in promoting his image as a funloving 
man who enjoyed outings to Las Vegas where show girls were all 
beautiful and I just love beautiful girls 
In his book Feynman also told how he demonstrated inadequate 
security at Los Alamos National Laboratory by learning to pick 
locks on file cabinets containing the nations Abomb secrets 
which didnt amuse his superiors on the topsecret Manhattan 
Project 
Feynman was especially popular with Caltech students who 
honored him for teaching excellence in 1982 He continued to teach 
freshman physics classes and to ham it up in school plays once 
taking on the role of a bongo player and appearing in the musical 
Guys and Dolls 
Caltech officials reported that when Feynman became ill a few 
years ago students and teachers overwhelmed local medical 
facilities with offers to donate blood 
Feynman is survived by his second wife Gweneth and two 
children 
Private funeral services for Feynman will be held later this 
week and will not be announced A public memorial service remains 
to be scheduled a Caltech spokesman said
