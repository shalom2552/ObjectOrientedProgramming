Presidential hopefuls looking to recover 
from poor showings or to get ahead going into Super Tuesday are 
stumping in Minnesota and South Dakota which offer the next big 
contests before the March 8 cluster of primaries and caucuses 
For Illinois Sen Paul Simon Minnesotas precinct caucuses and 
South Dakotas primary could make or break his Democratic 
presidential bid although Simon backed off from a statement that 
he would drop out if he lost in both states 
If I dont win either Minnesota or South Dakota Im going to 
drop out of the race I dont want to just continue indefinitely 
running second or third Simon had said early Wednesday But he 
later told reporters Were now hedging on that because of the 
reaction weve been getting from around the country 
New York Rep Jack Kemp in desperate need of a showing above 
third place also headed for Minnesota Wednesday 
Democrat Richard Gephardt left New Hampshire and flew straight 
to South Dakota Wednesday in an urgent search for a primary victory 
to make good his claim that his partys race is a twoman contest 
between him and Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis 
Dukakis the top Democratic votegetter in New Hampshire has 
waged the most aggressive campaign of the Democrats in Minnesota 
and has a strong campaign in South Dakota 
It gives us a tremendous shot in the arm Dukakis Minnesota 
campaign director Pat Forciea said of the New Hampshire win 
But Simon was staking his claim too 
The place where my natural roots are is right here in Hubert 
Humphrey land Simon said 
Hamilton Thompson Simons Minnesota campaign manager said his 
campaigns polling shows that 30 percent to 40 percent of 
Minnesotans who have attended caucuses in the past are undecided 
Additionally he said the polling suggests Simon is the second 
choice of many Jackson supporters and he expects some could come 
over to Simon if they decide Jackson cant win the race 
Gephardt who spent the most time campaigning in South Dakota 
and Dukakis were believed to have the best chances in that state 
according to state party leaders Simon also was considered to have 
strong support in South Dakota party officials said 
Kemp has one of the bestorganized Republican campaigns in 
Minnesota While his state campaign chairwoman Evie Axdahl 
expressed confidence that hell do well she acknowledged that his 
showing could be affected by wild card Pat Robertson the 
former television evangelist who has fared well in earlier caucus 
states 
Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas campaigned extensively in 
both states while Vice President George Bush made at least nine 
appearances in South Dakota but didnt campaign at all in Minnesota 
Prior to the Iowa caucuses Republican insiders said they 
expected Dole and Kemp to run a close 12 in Minnesota But 
Robertsons surprise secondplace showing in Iowa raised his 
supporters expectations and his opponents fears that he could 
do better than expected in the state 
Dole and Dukakis have spent substantially more than their 
opponents in the two states according to reports filed with the 
Federal Election Commission 
The Democratic events in both states are occurring earlier than 
national party rules allow and the states were embroiled for 
months in a heated dispute with the national party 
Under an agreement with national party officials South Dakotas 
Democratic primary results are officially nonbinding However 
state party officials say the delegates selected at a March 12 
statewide caucus will be be apportioned according to the popular 
vote 
The agreement Minnesota Democrats reached with the national 
party requires that a presidential preference poll taken at the 
precinct caucuses be kept secret until 5 pm on March 8 
However Minnesota Secretary of State Joan Growe plans to report 
caucusnight results from both the Democratic and Republican events
