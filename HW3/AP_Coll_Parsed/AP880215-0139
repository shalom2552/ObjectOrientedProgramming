Heat and hot water have returned after long 
absence to the rundown Brooklyn apartment building where the 
landlord is serving a 15day sentence of house arrest tenants said 
Monday 
But no other repairs are apparent tenants said 
Landlord Morris Gross 76 entered the building Friday to serve 
his sentence for failing to correct housing violations He also was 
ordered to apply 137900 in fines to repairs of more than 400 
violations that include roach and mice infestation lack of heat 
flooding and crumbling ceilings 
The first night of his stay heat was on all night I had to 
get up and open my windows said M Campbell a fourthfloor 
resident in the building 
But nothing is being done to my apartment said Ms 
Campbell who cited numerous problems within her apartment She 
also said she hasnt seen any repairs being done to the building 
itself or in the hallway 
But apartment 5C was replastered and painted before Gross moved 
in with two bodyguards Angry tenants and a banner reading 
Welcome Reptile greeted Gross when he arrived 
An ankle bracelet Gross is wearing lets authorities know he is 
staying in the apartment because it sends an electronic signal to a 
transmitter if he wanders more than 100 feet from it 
Joyce Stewart tenant association president said residents had 
been unable to talk to Gross about problems in the building and 
feared the heat will disappear once he does 
Ms Stewart had charged that cosmetic repairs had been done on 
only 10 to 12 apartments When you subtract that from 113 
apartments youll see the real McCoy
