Negotiators reached agreement Tuesday to end a 
nineday strike that has halted production at Ford Motor Cos 22 
plants in Britain and cost the automaker more than 300 million 
company and union officials said 
The deal will be submitted to Fords 32000 striking workers on 
Thursday and if approved could allow the automaker to resume 
production next Monday officials said 
The settlement came after Ford agreed to a twoyear pact with 
total minimum pay hikes of 14 percent negotiators said Ford 
previously insisted on a threeyear contract which auto workers 
opposed 
Ford said it will guarantee full pay to union members who are 
temporarily laid off The company said it would not permanently 
terminate any worker who does not volunteer to leave 
The agreement also stipulates that workrule changes would be 
decided at the plant level instead of being imposed by management 
said Mick Murphy chief negotiator for the 12 unions involved 
The contract also provides for increased pension benefits and an 
improved health plan 
We see it as a truly historic victory not only for Ford 
workers but for trade unionists up and down the country Murphy 
said after nine and a half hours of talks 
The deal was called a potential victory for common sense by 
John Hougham chief negotiator for Ford Motor Co Ltd the British 
subsidiary of the US automaker 
He denied that the automaker was pressured into the agreement by 
its Detroitbased parent or Ford of Europe 
The walkout which was Fords first strike in Britain in nearly 
a decade began Feb 8 three days after contract talks broke down 
Under terms of the agreement reached Tuesday weekly wages for 
an assembly worker making a basic 184 pounds or 320 will 
increase to 197 pounds or 343 in the first year of the new 
contract negotiators said 
Talks to provide the same benefits for hourly and whitecollar 
workers will be completed within two years the company said 
I do believe the company will get the changes in work 
practices it wants Murphy said But they will get them under 
the circumstances when they will carry the workforce with them 
There will be cooperation to bring about the changes we 
need Hougham said 
The strike prompted the layoff of more than 9700 workers and 
disrupted production at a Ford plant in Genk Belgium which 
suffered a shortage of Britishmade parts 
The strike has cost Ford 23 million pounds or about 40 million 
a day the automaker has estimated 
Fords British workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978
