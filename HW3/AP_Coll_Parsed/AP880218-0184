A majority of striking employees at Ford Motor 
Cos British plants voted Thursday to accept a twoyear contract 
offer signaling the end of the countrys first major industrial 
strike in three years 
The offer represented the first significant union victory in 
Britain in seven years Ford made several concessions to end the 
strike which began Feb 8 
Voter returns Thursday night showed 70 percent of the workers at 
the 22 British plants favored the offer Ford said The company 
said it expected workers to be back on the job Monday 
The Transport and General Workers Union which represents 
twothirds of the workers confirmed that about 70 percent of its 
members supported the proposal 
A final vote count was expected to be released Friday 
The settlement was worked out in negotiations Tuesday between 
company and union officials 
The company backed down on its demand for a threeyear contract 
offering the twoyear pact instead and agreed to a wage increase 
of at least 14 percent over the term of the contract 
Previously it offered an increase of 7 percent in the first 
year and 25 percent above the rate of inflation which is 
currently 33 percent over the next two years 
A middlerange worker earned 327 a week under the old contract 
Ford won some changes in work practices to boost productivity 
but they must be agreed to on the plant level rather than imposed 
by management 
The last major British union victory occurred in February 1981 
when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher backed off plans to close 
coal pits after miners threatened a nationwide strike 
The Ford strike has prompted layoffs of more than 9700 Ford 
workers in Genk Belgium It also threatened production at Ford 
plants in Spain and West Germany which rely on parts made at the 
British plants 
The car company said it didnt know when production at the Genk 
plant would return to normal 
Ford said the strike the to hit the automaker in Britain in 
nearly a decade was costing the company 350 million in lost 
production Fords British workers last struck in 1978 when they 
walked out for nine weeks 
The strike combined with a recent walkout by ferry workers and 
labor unrest in the staterun National Health Service and coal 
mines prompted concern that there might be a new wave of 
industrial strikes and an increase in pay demands in Britain 
Britain has been relatively free of labor strife since Mrs 
Thatchers Conservative government came to power and curbed the 
influence of Britains oncepowerful unions 
The last major industrial strike in Britain was a yearlong 
walkout by more than 90000 coal miners in 198485 It ended in 
defeat for their union
