A fad for jewelry made from the dials of old 
watches may pose a danger to unsuspecting wearers Many of the old 
watches used radium to make them glow in the dark and the 
radioactivity can cause cancer health officials say 
Were finding more and more of this stuff said Dr Jose 
Lopez supervisor at the Arlington regional office of the Texas 
Bureau of Radiation Control People suddenly think its cool to 
have necklaces earrings bola tie clasps and other things made 
with old watches 
But the radium on some old watch dials can cause cancer either 
on the skin or internally if the substance is inadvertently inhaled 
or swallowed 
Like calcium radium powder seeks the bone he said 
Radium jewelry definitely poses an increased risk of cancer 
Lopez said 
Radium was used in watches to make the hands and numbers glow 
he said Watch makers have since developed other ways to cause 
fluorescence 
When the watches were intact with glass covering the dial they 
were relatively harmless because the glass acted as a shield 
But the risk has increased since the watches have been 
dismantled to make jewelry and the risk is even greater to 
jewelers and other people who work with the timepieces than it is 
to buyers he said 
Three workshops in the Dallas area that were found to be 
handling the watches all registered some radioactive contamination 
he said 
Workers were getting the radium on their fingers and clothes 
Lopez said 
We found several places in the work areas that were hot with 
contamination he said 
Were sure there are other places out there he said 
The work is illegal as well as hazardous Lopez said People who 
handle radioactive materials must have a state license and to get 
one an applicant must take stringent precautions against 
contamination 
The radiation control bureau did not issue citations but told 
companies to remedy the contamination Lopez said 
Officials at the Texas Department of Health regional office in 
Arlington offered free testing of jewelry for radiation and free 
disposal of contaminated pieces Lopez said
