The latest appearance of a great white shark 
and Norman Mailers film of his own book received the dubious honor 
Wednesday of being at the top of the pack as the Golden Raspberry 
Award Foundation announced its picks for worst pictures of 1987 
The 8th Annual Golden Raspberry Award nominations also went to 
Bill Cosby Madonna Sylvester Stallone and the 35 million 
superflop Ishtar as the foundation took note of what it felt 
was truly terrible in motion pictures last year 
Jaws The Revenge and Tough Guys Dont Dance received 
seven Razzie nominations each with the acting considered so bad in 
the latest Jaws sequel that even Bruce the mechanical shark was 
nominated for worst actor 
The Razzies are a lighthearted parody of the Oscar ceremonies 
and coincide with the annual Academy Award nominations which will 
be announced Wednesday 
The Razzie ceremony will be held April 10 and will feature 
dramatic readings of the most ridiculous lyrics from some awful 
movie songs 
The winners if they dare to show up will receive a trophy of a 
golfball size raspberry glued atop a film reel and spraypainted 
with gold 
There are three basic theories of what qualifies as a 
Razzie explained John Wilson Razzie foundation president 
First Hollywoods own measure how much money did it lose 
Second a movie that was not supposed to be a comedy that generated 
enormous laughs from the audience Jaws was one of those and so 
was Norman Mailers Tough Guys Dont Dance which was laughed off 
the screen in Cannes 
The last is how excruciating it is to actually sit through a 
film Does someone have to pay you money or bribe you with popcorn 
Whos That Girl fits into that category he said 
Cosby received three nominations for star author and producer 
of Leonard Part 6 a movie that he disavowed and almost no one 
saw Madonna last years Worst Actress winner is a contender this 
year for Whos That Girl nominated for five Razzies 
Stallone the alltime Razzie champ with four wins is 
continuing the tradition with the maudlin armwrestling 
melodrama Over the Top which got three nominations 
The Golden Raspberry Foundation made up of film professionals 
and critics as well as frequent filmgoers in California and nine 
other states believe the worst pictures of 1987 were Ishtar 
Jaws The Revenge Leonard Part 6 Tough Guys Dont 
Dance and Whos That Girl 
Named for worst performances by an actor besides Bruce the 
Shark were Cosby in Leonard Part 6 Judd Nelson in From the 
Hip Ryan ONeal in Tough Guys Dont Dance and Stallone in 
Over the Top 
Worst actress nominations in addition to Madonna went to 
Sondra Locke in Ratboy Lorraine Gary in Jaws Debra 
Sandlund in Tough Guys Dont Dance and Sharon Stone in Allan 
Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold 
Worst supporting actor nominees are Billy Barty in Masters of 
the Universe Tom Bosley Mack Dryden and Jamie Alcroft all of 
Million Dollar Mystery Michael Caine in Jaws The Revenge 
and David Mendenhall in Over the Top 
Nominated for worst supporting actress are Gloria Foster 
Leonard Part 6 Daryl Hannah Wall Street Mariel 
Hemingway Superman IV Grace Jones Siesta and Isabella 
Rossellini for both Siesta and Tough Guys Dont Dance 
Worst director nominees were James Foley for Whos That 
Girl Norman Mailer for Tough Guys Dont Dance Elaine May 
for Ishtar Joseph Sargent for Jaws The Revenge and Paul 
Weiland for Leonard Part 6
