To the surprise of those who believed an 
economic downturn would be under way by now the number of people 
with jobs is at an alltime high generating concern of an entirely 
different sort 
The new concern finding expression among popular economists is 
that the nations fullemployment level might be approaching and 
with it the possibility of rising wages 
In short inflation 
As with all economic fears this too could evaporate But there 
exists some statistical evidence to suggest that a long period of 
wage stability could be nearing an end if the economic expansion 
continues 
In theory the approach of full employment means upward pressure 
on wages and a need to rely on lessskilled workers which combine 
to lower productivity and force prices higher 
More than 114 million civilians were employed in January 1988 
more than 5 million above the figure for January 1986 While the 
labor force has risen in that time the jobless rate has fallen to 
58 percent from 67 percent 
The socalled full employment level in which all who are 
willing and able to work have jobs other than for those who are 
between jobs is difficult to forecast since it reveals itself 
mainly in labor shortages and rising wages 
Viewing various sets of statistics economist J Patrick Bradley 
of PNC Financial Corp a Philadelphia bankholding company 
believes full employment hasnt been reached given the modest 
gains in wages relative to inflation 
Various reasons are offered for the absence of strong wage 
gains such as a decline in the level of unionism and a tendency 
for workers to be older and more experienced and already at peak 
earnings 
But says Bradley such explanations make little difference 
It merely means that the fullemployment rate has not yet been 
reached and therefore is not yet a source of inflationary 
pressure 
Those who place their faith in quarterly economic surveys by the 
National Federation of Independent Business are less certain that 
full employment is still a distance away 
That survey released this week shows very strong hiring plans 
among that organizations 500000 members Coupled with already 
recordhigh employment levels such intentions could be interpreted 
as spelling trouble 
Dean William Dunkelberg of Temple Universitys school of 
business who conducts the survey found 23 percent of firms had 
job openings in the final quarter of 1987 and that 19 percent plan 
to raise employment in the current quarter 
These are the strongest hiring plans recorded since 1978 on a 
seasonally adjusted basis he said noting that the intent to add 
workers was especially strong in manufacturing with 28 percent of 
such companies planning to hire 
The same survey suggested that wage pressure has begun showing 
up with 23 percent of all companies reporting higher labor costs 
in the final quarter of 1987 
Simultaneously the survey showed what Dunkelberg termed a 
surprising 5 percentagepoint jump in plans to raise compensation 
bringing to almost onequarter the number of companies with such 
plans 
He reasons that The rather large jump in plans to increase 
compensation may be an early indication that the longexpected 
problems on the wage front may have finally arrived 
Partly as a consequence the percent of companies planning to 
raise prices jumped 6 points to 27 percent of all companies That 
increase was the highest recorded for January in three years
