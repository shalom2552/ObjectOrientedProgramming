President Kurt Waldheim was quoted Sunday 
as saying he will not resign because a great and silent 
majority supports him despite the furor over his World War II 
conduct 
I feel the group who makes the demand that I should resign is 
relatively small compared to those who want me to stay in office 
the president said in an interview published in the tabloid Kurier 
On Saturday Chancellor Franz Vranitzky launched his harshest 
criticism yet of Waldheim when he said that mere noninvolvement in 
war crimes did not qualify one to be president of Austria 
A top government official disclosed meanwhile that a majority in 
the Socialist Party which is governing Austria with Waldheims 
conservative backers wants the president to resign 
Vranitzky a Socialist and head of government spoke in a radio 
interview about Waldheim whose duties as head of state are mostly 
ceremonial He criticized the presidents conduct throughout the 
international debate about his wartime past 
Without mentioning names Vranitzky berated Waldheim and his 
conservative backers for accepting word from six military 
historians who said they found no evidence Waldheim was involved in 
war crimes but dismissing the rest of their report 
The 202page document presented on Monday established 
Waldheims close proximity to wartime atrocities in the Balkans 
and seriously questioned his moral integrity as a German army 
officer during World War II 
Last year the US Justice Department barred Waldheim from the 
country as an undesirable alien and said his unit sent thousands of 
Jews to Nazi death camps 
Vranitzky told Austrian radio After all nobody has ever 
conducted an election campaign by saying Please vote for me 
because I am not a war criminal 
The federal president will certainly continue to be confronted 
with a series of questions and will have to face up to them 
In the Kurier interview Waldheim said I do not at all share 
the opinion of the historians commission that he had kept silent 
about or belittled his wartime activities 
I was also of the opinion that it did not belong in the 
framework of this task of the commission to make such assumptions 
and interpretations 
After all the surveys I am rather convinced that the great 
majority which is very often the silent one wants me to stay 
on he was quoted as saying 
Waldheim was in Innsbruck Saturday with Jordanian King Hussein 
and Queen Noor in his first public appearance since the 
commissions report was released 
The president was greeted by about 50 whistling protesters who 
called for his resignation and threw eggs at waiting limousines 
Waldheim was scheduled to address the nation in a fiveminute 
television appearance Monday night 
In West Germany Der Spiegel magazine said Saturday that a 
document linking Waldheim to the deportations of thousands of 
civilians during World War II was a fake and apologized for 
publishing it 
Spiegel regrets that it presented this document to its 
readers as the proof of Waldheims involvement the magazine 
said in its latest edition 
Spiegel said Bernhard Haas a document expert from Stuttgart 
concluded that the military telegram was in all likelihood a 
fake 
The telegram allegedly linked Waldheim to the deportation of 
more than 4000 civilians while he served as an officer in the 
German army in Yugoslavia in 1942 
The document was not used by the commission investigating the 
president 
Heinrich Keller a chief secretary in the Socialist Party 
reported that for the first time a majority of party members want 
Waldheim to resign 
Keller who was also interviewed by Austrian radio said he saw 
a turnaround in rankandfile sentiment in the wake of the 
commissions report 
The Socialists are senior partners in the coalition government 
with the conservatives 
At the Socialist Party congress last October a majority of 198 
delegates voted against a resolution calling for Waldheims 
resignation while 101 supported the motion There were 276 
abstentions 
I would believe that such a vote today would have rather the 
reverse outcome Keller said
