Gov Tommy Thompson asked Wisconsins 
attorney general today to prepare a lawsuit against Chrysler Corp 
because of its plans to close its automaking plant in Kenosha 
Wis but left open the possibility of a settlement 
Thompson said it was possible an agreement could be reached with 
Chrysler before the issue actually goes to court 
Asked about the odds of the matter actually ending up in court 
Thompson replied I dont want to engage in a percentage at 
this time 
The governor stressed that in such matters it is always 
desirable to negotiate before going to court 
That would certainly spare the trauma It would be better off 
for both parties to settle without going to court he said 
The attorney general has advised me that we do have a good 
and winnable case said Thompson who was joined at a news 
conference by Attorney General Don Hanaway 
Thompson said it could be some time before the suit is filed 
over Chryslers decision to lay off 5500 workers in Kenosha 
He said he talked Tuesday with Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and 
would meet later with other Chrysler officials He declined to say 
where or when the meeting would occur 
The lawsuit is a type of thing that can be won in several 
ways Thompson said 
The governor said he has asked Hanaway to check with local 
government officials in Kenosha and with United Auto Workers union 
Local 72 at the Chrysler plant there to see if they want to join in 
the lawsuit 
Thompson repeated his contention that Chryslers decision to 
abandon automaking in Kenosha was political and not economic 
He said OmniHorizon cars were being produced at Kenosha 
efficiently and were of the highest quality 
There is no reason he said for Chrysler not to live up 
to what the state contends was an agreement by the automaker to 
produce the cars at the plant for five years 
All of us at Chrysler are very sorry that the plant had to be 
closed We also feel very deeply for the pain and suffering of 
the workers and community Chrysler Motors Chairman Gerald 
Greenwald said at a news conference in Chicago after Thompsons 
announcement 
I guess you could say Chrysler was overly optimistic when it 
told workers and government officials in Wisconsin that it believed 
it could build the OmniHorizon small car at Kenosha for up to five 
years Greenwald said 
But we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no 
grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie he said 
Greenwald said Chrysler will repay the city and county of 
Kenosha more than 1 million the governments spent on improvements 
for the plant 
My position is the retention of 5500 jobs for five years 
Thompson said Those jobs dont necessarily have to be automobile 
jobs They could be other manufacturing jobs 
Hanaway said it had not been decided precisely what Wisconsin 
would seek in the suit but he said the state probably would ask 
the court for an injunction to delay the layoffs 
Thompson asked if defense contracts for the plant might be 
something the state would go after replied I think that is a 
possibility 
In fiscal year 1987 Chrysler Corp and three subsidiaries 
Electrospace Systems Inc Gulfstream Aerospace and American Motors 
Corp were awarded 375 Pentagon contracts worth more than 268 
million 
In the first two months of fiscal 1988 the contractors won 11 
million in contracts
