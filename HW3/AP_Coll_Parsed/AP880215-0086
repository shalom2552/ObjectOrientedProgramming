Alabamas NAACP president who was 
arrested during an effort to remove a Confederate battle flag from 
atop the state Capitol has vowed another day of reckoning 
I can tell you there will be another effort state Rep 
Thomas Reed said Sunday following a strategy meeting with other 
black leaders in Montgomery 
You have not seen anything yet Reed said but he did not 
provide details of his plans 
On Feb 2 Reed and 13 other black legislators were arrested on 
trespassing charges when they tried to climb a fence around the 
Capitol 
During the news conference the estimated 70 people who attended 
the black summit stood and clapped in support of a motion to 
continue efforts to remove the flag 
The meeting was attended by Earl Shinhoster southeastern 
regional director of the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People presidents of NAACP branches throughout the 
state and representatives of other black groups including the 
Alabama Democratic Conference and the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference 
Shinhoster asked those attending to wage an intensive lobbying 
effort and also to gather support from the heads of their local 
chambers of commerce He also said the NAACP will consider legal 
action concerning the Confederate flag in Alabama and three other 
states 
Last year the NAACP called for the removal of the Confederate 
flag that flies on state capitols in Alabama and South Carolina and 
is incorporated into state flags in Georgia and Mississippi 
Shinhoster said the effort to remove what he called an odious 
symbol of a bygone era has the most promise in Alabama because 
black legislators took the lead and hit the fence and went to 
jail 
Reed said the flag dispute could have been quickly settled by 
Gov Guy Hunt But Hunt has refused to remove the flag saying it 
has historical significance and should remain until the Legislature 
decides otherwise 
Reed said the Rebel flag is the last psychological weapon 
signifying oppression of black people He vowed that the oldest 
person attending Sundays meeting would live long enough to see 
that Confederate battle flag come down from the Capitol
