Frontrunner Michael Dukakis became the 
focus of attacks from his Democratic rivals Sunday as the 
Republican hopefuls traded barbs in one last debate in the 
increasingly bitter campaign for the New Hampshire primary 
Less than 48 hours before the first votes will be cast in the 
first primary GOP candidate Pat Robertson called for the gradual 
abolition of Social Security Opponent Jack Kemp said the former 
television evangelist has some offthewall ideas 
George Bush and Bob Dole running neckandneck for Tuesdays 
primary tossed charges back and forth in the hourlong League of 
Women Voters debate on Sunday night 
You were for it before you read it I waited to read it first 
Thats the difference Dole said about the new arms control 
treaty with the Soviets 
I was for it when the president proposed it Bush retorted 
Later in the debate Kemp blew up at Bush when the vice 
president used the 1960s phrase Give peace a chance 
You should be embarrassed to use Give peace a chance Kemp 
said Were the party of peace through strength 
Kemp also went after Dole 
I am convinced that Senator Dole has a secret plan to raise 
taxes on the American people Kemp said in Bedford NH before 
the debate That would totally frustrate the Republican message 
that we are the lowtax party 
On the Democratic side Sen Paul Simon of Illinois switched to 
attacking Dukakis the clear frontrunner in the Democratic field 
Simon dropped his controversial focus on Missouri Rep Richard 
Gephardt with whom he is battling for the No 2 spot 
I think it is increasingly clear that Paul Simon is now ahead 
of Dick Gephardt Simon told a Manchester news conference 
There is a difference and a clear alternative to Mike Dukakis 
Simon is emphasizing a new ad aimed at the Massachusetts 
governor 
In endorsing Paul Simon for president the Lawrence 
EagleTribune of Massachusetts said President Dukakis would head a 
bureaucracy President Simon would head a nation of people the 
ad said 
Simon denied that the ad change had anything to do with 
Gephardts harsh criticism of the commercials 
For his part Gephardt has a television ad calling Dukakis one 
of the biggest tax raisers in Massachusetts history The Missouri 
congressman rejected suggestions he embraced Reaganomics in 1981 as 
balderdash saying the question was were we for the tax cut 
for the middle class or we were not 
Dukakis rejected the suggestion in Simons ad 
We didnt have dozens and dozens of UAW members United Auto 
Workers up here working their heads off and dozens and dozens of 
firefighters working their heads off for me yesterday because they 
dont think Im for working men and women Dukakis said in 
Manchester 
Early in the debate Bush said the differences among the 
Republicans were not what they seem 
Were going to be together after thisSo it doesnt have the 
deep decisions that you might think from the agony of the moment or 
the ad of the moment or from the charge and countercharge Bush 
said 
But he and Dole continued their charges about leadership outside 
the debate format 
I dont think he has made any decisions in the last seven 
years the Kansas senator said of Bush in a CBS News interview 
broadcast Sunday 
Dole said he is pleased with his progress in New Hampshire 
where Bush once had a big lead I have come a long way in the 
last 30 days 
For his part Bush defended his campaigns ads that say Dole has 
straddled making decisions on several major issues 
The man is running on leadership Bush told reporters in 
Nashua I think it is fair to look at the results 
Robertson who ran second in the Iowa caucuses still grabbed 
the attention as he said he might do even better in New Hampshire 
I want to have the satisfaction of seeing the television 
anchormens faces when they have to report that Pat Robertson won 
New Hampshire the former television evangelist told a 
congregation at the Faith Christian Center in Bedford NH 
Church ushers ordered reporters not to take tape recorders or 
pens and paper into the service checking them at the door to 
enfoce the rule Robertson gave a political speech in which he 
talked of how his life had been guided by Gods messages including 
his race for the White House 
Asked if he might best Bush again Robertson said on CBSTVs 
Face the Nation Wouldnt that be a wonderful thing for the 
country 
Robertson said there isnt going to be any money available 
in Social Security in the next century when younger people retire 
Thus he wants to gradually abolish the system while paying 
current benefits over 40 years moving it into a private 
system 
Kemp who is battling Robertson for conservative hearts minds 
and votes lashed out at the former preacher 
He has said some offthewall things about the economy about 
foreign policy Kemp said on NBCTVs Meet The Press Asked 
for specifics Kemp said Robertson has said Credit cards are the 
mark of the beast and that we are going to hell in a hand basket 
because of the deficit 
Dole said he thought Robertson would not do as well in New 
Hampshire as in Iowa 
He broke a lot of china in Iowa and hes working very hard in 
the state of New Hampshire Who knows Dole said on ABCTVs 
This Week with David Brinkley I think it is a lot more 
difficult for him in a state like New Hampshire 
Kemp and Robertson both distributed literature at churches a 
tactic Robertson used successfuly last Sunday in Iowa Kemp workers 
were in the church parking lots passing out brochures headlined 
Jack Kemp The candidate for believers while Robertson forces 
once again handed out a Biblical Scoreboard 
Former Colorado Sen Gary Hart said he would not end his 
bornagain Democratic campaign if he does not do well in New 
Hampshire the state that gave him a miracle victory in 1984 
Of course not was his reply to the question on the NBC 
program 
And Hart said he is not just on an ego trip by continuing his 
campaign Im not a dog in the manger Im not a spoiler 
New polls by ABC News and CBS News showed Bush and Dole knotted 
at about 30 percent among Republicans Kemp Robertson and du Pont 
were tied at about 10 percent 
On the Democratic side Dukakis kept his big lead with around 40 
percent in both surveys Simon and Gephardt were fighting for 
second They were tied in the ABC poll but Gephardt held a tiny 
lead in the CBS survey Others trailed
