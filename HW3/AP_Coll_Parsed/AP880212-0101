The auto division achieved a turnaround in 1983 after more than 
10 years in the red It had piled up estimated debts and losses of 
about 416 million by 1979 The auto sector accounts for 50 percent 
of Fiats revenue now Industrial vehicles tractors and 
earthmoving machines bring the total to about 72 percent 
The group boosted its net earnings to 522 million in 1984 to 
11 billion in 1985 and 18 billion in 1986 
Fiat which last year took over statecontrolled Alfa Romeo to 
increase its dominance in the Italian market has a 61 percent 
share of the domestic market of automobiles a higher percentage 
than any other major European car manufacturer and a 143 percent 
share in Europe 
It holds a minor share of the US market as the bulk of its 
production is made up of smallsized cars However it has high 
hopes for the Alfa Romeo models The luxury 164 Alfa Italys most 
expensive massproduced sedan will be marketed aggressively in the 
United States while another Fiat subsidiary the prestigious 
Ferrari has a healthy market for its sports cars overseas 
In the face of growing automation and a modest increase of auto 
demand in Europe Besuzzo said Fiats auto employment is not 
expected to rise or decline through the 90s 
Franco Lotito secretary of the metalworkers division Unione 
Italiana Lavoratori UIL one of the largest Italian trade unions 
agreed with Besuzzos predictions 
Lotito emphasized that the sharp cut in employment resulting 
from robots at Fiat did not cause a dramatic social impact thanks 
to layoffs subsidized by a state fund early retirements and 
reemployment of some workers in state jobs 
At the beginning we had nourished the illusion that automation 
could coexist with a high rate of employment he added in an 
interview That proved wrong yet we did not oppose technology in 
the factories because we were aware it was the only possibility to 
keep the auto industry competitive Unions which opposed 
automation like in Britain only caused the collapse of the 
companies and massive dismissals 
The growing health of the group and of the Agnelli dynasty has 
recently been worrying some Italian politicians 
The Socialist Party whose relations with Fiat became tense 
following a bitter controversy over the candidate to head Telit a 
joint telecommunications venture between Fiat and the state holding 
copmpany IRI accused the Turin group and the Agnellis of 
dominating Italian industry 
Some politicians called for an antitrust law on grounds that 
industrial and financing holdings directly or indirectly controlled 
by the Agnelli family have a market capitalization equal to 228 
percent of the entire Italian stock market 
Fiats influence on the Italian news media also came under 
questioning Fiat owns the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa has 
effective control of the Rizzoli publishing house and Milans 
influential Corriere della Sera newspaper and has expressed some 
interest of moving into commercial television 
Giovanni Agnelli recently cooled down the controversy noting 
that Fiat revenue accounts for less than 4 percent of the gross 
domestic product 
The three major statecontrolled holding companies together 
account for 10 percent and this is not causing any worry Agnelli 
said 
Agnelli is such a wellknown public figure that he is often 
referred to merely as Lavvocato the title for a laywer in 
Italy he holds a law degree He is always widely quoted whether 
it be on business or politics or Italys most successful soccer 
team Juventus which he owns
