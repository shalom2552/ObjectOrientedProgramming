Sen Paul Simon said today that unless 
he wins in either Minnesota or South Dakota next Tuesday he will 
drop out of the race for president 
Im having a press conference where Im going to say I 
have to win in either Minnesota or South Dakota receive additional 
funding from small donors or Im going to have to withdraw from 
the race Simon said on ABCs Good Morning America 
Simon said his thirdplace finish in New Hampshire was 
strong but added that he cant indefinitely come in second 
and third 
We have a good base in Minnesota and South Dakota I think 
we have a real shot at one or both of those states he said 
Minnesota holds caucuses next Tuesday while South Dakotans go to 
the polls in a primary election 
Simon said earlier that while finishing behind New Hampshire 
Democratic winner Michael Dukakis and secondplace Richard Gephardt 
wasnt what he had hoped for he will not change the focus of his 
campaign 
No absolutely not the Illinois Democrat said as he edged 
out of his election night headquarters amid a swarm of reporters 
and cameras The message has to be the same Thats what I 
believe 
Speaking earlier to supporters gathered at a restaurant he 
vowed to be the advocate for a nation that once more cares for 
working men and women that fights for the less fortunate that 
stands up for middleclass Americans who want to send their 
children to college that reaches out to build a world that is 
safer for our children and generations to come 
Simons national campaign spokesman attempted to put the best 
face on the thirdplace showing maintaining that the candidate 
turned conventional wisdom topsyturvy even before the New 
Hampshire vote 
Spokesman Terry Michael said Simon was able to blunt Gephardts 
momentum coming out of Iowa and that New Hampshire was a lock for 
Dukakis 
Simon has acknowledged that finances are a problem for his 
campaign and he had hoped for a secondplace showing in New 
Hampshire to aid in fundraising 
Michael said the Simon campaign had debts of about 500000 
with about 200000 on hand but expected to raise another 300000 
to 400000 this week 
Simon after congratulating his backers for their efforts urged 
them not to give up 
You have not been campaigning just for some fellow wearing a 
bow tie he said You have been campaigning for a cause 
Simon was accompanied on a makeshift stage by his wife Jeanne 
and other supporters when it partially collapsed as he began his 
remarks 
Recovering quickly Simon joked Believe it or not the 
platform I stand on is a bit solider
