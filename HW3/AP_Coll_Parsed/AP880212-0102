Getting food to hungry people caught in 
Mozambiques guerrilla war has become more and more risky and 
expensive for international relief agencies 
Antigovernment guerrillas who have sabotaged rail lines and 
roads now have threatened to shoot down relief planes 
The International Red Cross stopped flying to areas outside 
provincial capitals last Christmas after receiving a threat from 
the guerrillas 
CARE International which runs a famine relief food transport 
program in cooperation with Mozambiques government is now 
operating airlifts to remote areas the Red Cross once served 
But we dont know how long we can keep it up said David 
Neff an American who is CAREs director in Mozambique 
He said it costs eight times more to move food by air than by 
truck but 16 districts in four provinces can be supplied only by 
plane Six towns cannot be reached at all he added because of 
sabotage to the rail and road routes or the heavy concentration of 
the Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas fighting the 
Marxistled government 
On a recent CARE flight that carried reporters to Sena the main 
highway could be seen below pitted with trenches and blocked by 
tree branches Tracks on the railroad line were torn up 
The guerrillas have rocketpropelled grenade launchers many of 
captured from the army but they can bring down a plane with a 
pistol if they hit you right said Mike Mispelaar CAREs 
international operations manager 
The guerrillas have blown up the longest railroad bridge in 
Africa near Sena They often carry away railroad tracks set 
explosives on the lines and have made road travel so dangerous that 
85 percent of Western food aid doesnt move unless it can join an 
army convoy 
We cant count the cost of vehicles sitting idle waiting for 
convoys said Neff 
Most of the difficulty in getting grain from a seaport to a 
hungry refugee in the droughtstricken bush is due to guerrilla 
attacks on the transportation system 
Until last year the guerrillas kept one of the nations primary 
rail road and oil pipeline routes the Beira Corridor inoperable 
most of the time 
But in 1987 Mozambique arranged for troops from neighboring 
Zimbabwe to guard the corridor between Harare and Beira and help 
defend the Indian Ocean port The corridor is Zimbabwes cheapest 
route to the sea 
Other neighbors also help Soldiers from Malawi are stationed 
along the NampulaNacala route in the northern part of Mozambique 
where sabotage still occurs regularly troops from Tanzania have 
been assigned to guard recaptured towns freeing Mozambican troops 
to retake other vital targets 
If you protect 10 percent of Mozambique you protect 90 percent 
of the economy of the country said Trade Minister Manuel Jorge 
ArandaSilva in an interview You need only have the transport 
system linked with that 10 percent This is survival It is not 
growth 
Most of the Beira railroad track has been relaid with concrete 
ties instead of timber ones Canadian rails and heavier ballast 
It is much harder to sabotage and an explosion is less likely to 
derail a train 
The NampulaNacala line most useful for Malawian exports in the 
north still needs to be relaid as does a line from Zimbabwe down 
the Limpopo River to Maputo It goes through arid regions where 
security is difficult and where the track is so flimsy a saboteur 
can simply walk away with the rails 
Moving donated food from overseas to nearly half of the 
Mozambican population under such conditions requires constantly 
shifting strategies explained Mispelaar who is from India 
Immediately after you hear about a local highway blocking you 
move spare food up on available charters get everything off the 
roads in that area move other shipments up by sea reschedule 
certain donations so they go to a different port he said 
When the bandits rebels came to know about a shipment and 
attacked 60 kilometers 37 miles north of Chokwe we couldnt move 
the other trucks we had kept back on standby Bags start piling up 
looting starts You can tip the balance with the smallest mistake 
CARE nevertheless distributes more than 300 tons of food a day 
to market places and refugee centers throughout the country 
Planes unload bags of corn and rice on air strips Women wearing 
only wrapped skirts in the blazing sun trudge in single file for 
hours carrying the bags on their heads They often are guarded by 
soldiers 
Some food is loaded onto tractors and taken over roads where 
land mines are hidden Other bags are carried by canoes to isolated 
farming settlements 
Food is a priority so there are shortages of clothes tools and 
seeds 
There are more people coming out of the bush to the 
resettlement camps said Mispelaar They come with nothing but 
if you can give them a few seeds basic tools some bamboo poles 
and a little food they start building they start planting they 
are not totally dependent on handouts
