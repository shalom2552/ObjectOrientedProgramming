Attorneys for relatives of a murdered woman will 
try to convince a federal jury that an ad in the military magazine 
Soldier of Fortune led to her death and that the magazine should 
pay them 225 million 
Robert Black of Bryan was sent to the Texas death row for paying 
10000 to a hitman to kill his wife Sandra in 1985 The alleged 
triggerman John Wayne Hearn is serving life terms in Florida for 
other killings 
Marjorie Einmann Mrs Blacks mother and Gary Black the 
victims 18yearold son contend in their civil suit that an ad 
Hearn placed in the Denverbased publication brought him to the 
attention of Robert Black 
They are seeking 25 million in actual damages and 20 million 
in punitive damages from the magazine which calls itself a 
publication for professional adventurers 
Our case is there was another party in this crime Soldier of 
Fortune Ron Franklin attorney for the plaintiffs said at the 
start of the trial Tuesday He accused the magazine of giving Black 
the means to accomplish the murder 
Magazine attorney Larry Thompson defended the publication of the 
ad 
No one at Soldier of Fortune suspected anything criminal in 
that ad or any other ad in Soldier of Fortune We think the 
evidence will clearly show Soldier of Fortune was not negligent 
he said 
Among questions asked prospective jurors earlier Tuesday before 
a panel was selected was whether they owned a gun or had watched 
Rambo and John Wayne movies 
The trial could last through next week US District Judge 
David Hittner said 
The ad in question appeared in four issues of the magazine in 
late 1984 and sought former Marine and Vietnam veterans and 
weapons specialists with jungle warfare expertise for high risk 
assignments in the United States or overseas 
CBS News reported Tuesday that Hearn said in a court deposition 
that he had received 10 to 20 calls a day in response to the ad 
Most of the callers wanted to hire him for illegal acts including 
kidnappings bombings and murder the network said 
Hearn claimed he was contacted by one group to murder Canadian 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney 
From a defense perspective theres no doubt Hearn and Black 
met as a result of the ad Thompson said But that is the only 
thin thread with regard to Soldier of Fortune With that ad there 
was no way for anyone to determine he was seeking criminal 
conduct 
You bet were going to win publisher Robert Brown said I 
have no doubt about it 
Brown wearing a pinstriped suit and cowboy boots flipped 
through the pages of one his magazines while Hittner took about an 
hour to review motions filed by attorneys in the case 
The suit filed 13 months ago originally sought about 100 
million in damages Glenn Einmann Mrs Blacks father recently 
and without explanation removed himself as a plaintiff 
Franklin in arguments over pretrial motions said Brown has 
published and run ads in the magazine for books on learning how to 
be a commando 
Robert K Brown says that never in his wildest dreams would he 
think that the ad would result in criminal conduct Franklin 
said Yet in the same issue of the magazine he has an ad for How 
To Be A Hitman
