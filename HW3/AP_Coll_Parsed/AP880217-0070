A convicted member of the Red Brigades 
terrorist organization was freed from prison after the government 
overturned a court decision to extradite him to Italy 
Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas told reporters that 
Maurizio Folini 34 had been convicted on charges that were 
mainly of a political character 
Koutsogiorgas added that a request by Folini for political 
asylum in Greece would be considered as a separate matter The 
minister spoke to reporters after the government issued its 
decision Tuesday 
Folini convicted in absentia by an Italian court in 1986 on 
terrorism charges was arrested in Athens on June 22 1987 after 
entering Greece on a false passport 12 days earlier 
Italian authorities immediately requested his extradition 
Last September the Greek Supreme Court upheld a lower court 
ruling that Folini should be extradited but he remained in prison 
pending Justice Ministry confirmation of the decision 
Premier Andreas Papandreous socialist government had come under 
fire from radical leftwingers seeking Folinis release
