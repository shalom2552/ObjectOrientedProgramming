Two liberal Democrats are locked in a 
close primary battle for a chance to succeed Sen John C Stennis 
whose retirement has given Mississippi an open Senate seat for only 
the second time in 40 years 
Stennis 86 and a 41year veteran of the Senate announced Oct 
19 that he would not seek reelection 
The March 8 primary which coincides with the states Super 
Tuesday presidential primary pits Rep Wayne Dowdy a congressman 
since 1981 against Secretary of State Dick Molpus A third 
candidate Biloxi pipefitter Gilbert Fountain also is on the 
ballot but is trailing far behind 
No one is challenging Rep Trent Lott the House minority whip 
for the Republican nomination 
The MolpusDowdy battle rated a tossup in the most recent 
polls has been waged mostly in the media But in recent weeks the 
two contenders have been crisscrossing the state making brief 
campaign stops in a host of towns 
Dowdy 44 who gained his 4th Congressional District seat in a 
1981 special election has been stressing his experience in 
Washington Molpus 38 has been touting his record as director of 
federalstate programs under former Gov William Winter and as 
secretary of state since 1984 
Dowdy also a former mayor of McComb in southern Mississippi 
was the first candidate to enter tha race after Stennis said he was 
retiring 
It was a tough decision to give up my House seat said 
Dowdy adding he felt he could have a greater impact for his 
constituents in the Senate 
Molpus a native of central Mississippi said he entered 
government in the first place to make Mississippi a better place 
to live and believes he can do that most effectively in the 
United States Senate 
A poll conducted Feb 1213 for a Jackson radio station showed 
Dowdy with the backing of 405 percent of the Democrats questioned 
compared to 356 percent for Molpus Fountain 47 who ran for 
governor last year and finished seventh in the eightman field had 
25 percent and 22 percent were undecided The poll of 630 
Democrats had a 4 percent margin of error 
Another poll two weeks earlier for several state newspapers had 
Molpus leading 39 percent to 34 percent with 2 percent for 
Fountain and 26 percent undecided It surveyed 526 voters and a had 
35 percent margin of error 
Because Dowdy and Molpus differ little in their political 
philosophies some groups have found it difficult choosing whom to 
endorse 
The Mississippi AFLCIO gave Dowdy its backing but said if 
Molpus wins the Democratic nomination its endorsement will 
automatically go to him 
The politically active Mississippi Association of Educators 
endorsed both candidates and said it would support the primary 
winner 
Lott 46 who has served eight terms in the House says hell 
stress his own Washington experience when his campaign gets under 
way in earnest after the primary 
My role as whip in the House has prepared me well and 
certainly after 16 years in the House of Representatives I know my 
way around the halls of Washington the Pascagoula resident said 
The only other wide open fight for a US Senate seat in the 
last four decades came in 1978 when Sen Thad Cochran RMiss won 
a threeway fight for the seat that had been held since 1941 by the 
late Sen James O Eastland a Democrat and Delta planter 
Cochran became the states first GOP senator in a century by 
picking up 45 percent of the vote in a battle that included 
Democrat Maurice Dantin and black independent Charles Evers He won 
reelection in 1984 with 58 percent 
Stennis the nations oldest and most senior senator won his 
seat in a special election in 1947 taking the place of longtime 
state powerbroker Theo G Bilbo 
Stennis was a longtime Southern power broker in the Senate 
particularly on military matters and funding First as chairman of 
Armed Services and then of Appropriations he helped funnel 
millions in military projects and bases into the state 
In addition Stennis was a major proponent of the 
oftencriticized TennesseTombigbee Waterway which runs through the 
northeast part of the state Some critics claimed the 2 billion 
234mile project completed in 1985 was a classic example of 
federal pork barrel politics 
Stennis never faced a serious challenger until Haley Barbour 
left a political post in the White House to make the 1982 race But 
Stennis then 81 raised a 1 million and ran a slick media 
campaign He wound up carrying all but two of the states 82 
counties and beat Barbour by a 64to36 percent margin
