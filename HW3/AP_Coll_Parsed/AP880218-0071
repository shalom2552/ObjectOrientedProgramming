Mohammed Ali Hamadi denied 
involvement in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner according to 
testimony today at the kidnapping trial of his brother Abbas Ali 
Hamadi 
Abbas Hamadi is accused of kidnapping two West Germans in 
January 1987 in a bid to force the West German government to reject 
a US extradition request for Mohammed Hamadi 
The contents of several letters Mohammed Hamadi wrote to 
relatives in Beirut after his arrest in West Germany last year were 
read into the court record today 
West German federal criminal officers seized the letters before 
they could be smuggled out of the Frankfurt prison where Mohammed 
Hamadi is being held 
In a letter dated Jan 21 1987 Mohammed Hamadi wrote to his 
parents I found out today about the United States allegations 
I am being accused of something that I had nothing to do with 
In another letter to another brother Abdul Hadi Hamadi 
Mohammed wrote I only ask that the kidnappers take good care of 
the hostages Theyre just people being held like me 
On Wednesday federal investigator Klaus Pruefer said an 
acquaintance of Abbas Hamadis Hamsa Kassim told police the 
defendant informed him in a telephone conversation that West German 
businessman Rudolf Cordes had been kidnapped 
Kassim quoted Hamadi who was calling from Beirut as saying 
We have kidnapped a West German according to his statement to 
police 
Excerpts of Kassims statement to police were read into the 
court record on Wednesday Cordes was kidnapped Jan 17 1987 
shortly after Hamadis brother Mohammed was arrested in Frankfurt 
and later accused of the TWA hijacking 
In one excerpt read into the court record Kassim who lives in 
Saarland state said Abbas Hamadi told him that Mohammed Hamadi was 
arrested because he was one of the kidnappers of the American 
TWA jetliner 
Kassim also told police that Abbas Hamadi made the remarks on 
Jan 14 1987 one day after his brother Mohammed was arrested at 
Frankfurt airport carrying explosives 
Abbas Hamadi is accused of kidnapping the two West Germans in 
Beirut in a bid to force the West German government to reject a 
US request to extradite his brother West Germany turned down the 
extradition request but has since charged him in this country 
Last week former West German hostage Alfred Schmidt testified 
that Hamadi was not among the initial gunmen who kidnapped him from 
his Beirut hotel room Jan 20 He said Hamadi was older and taller 
than the men who abducted him 
Schmidt also said he did not think a man who questioned him in 
German in Beirut was Hamadi Abbas Hamadi lived in West Germany and 
speaks fluent German 
Federal officers have testified that Abbas Hamadis fingerprints 
were found on a letter Schmidt wrote to family members during his 
captivity 
Schmidt was released in September in what his kidnappers said 
was a goodwill gesture Cordes is still being held 
West German authorities last week charged Mohammed Hamadi with 
murder and air piracy in connection with the 1985 hijacking of the 
TWA jetliner to Beirut He faces the same charges in the United 
States A US Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans were held for 
17 days in the hijacking ordeal 
A trial date for Mohammed Hamadi 23 has not yet been set If 
convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison 
He remains in investigative custody in Frankfurt 
A third West German citizen Ralph Rudolf Schray was kidnapped 
in Beirut three weeks ago in an apparent attempt to increase 
pressure on West Germany to release the Hamadi brothers 
No one has claimed responsibility for that kidnapping
