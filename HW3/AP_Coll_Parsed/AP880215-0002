In Ottumwa Iowa Kathy Pietraszewski stood in the doorway at 
the place where the Republican caucus was held last Monday night to 
encourage shy voters to cross the threshhold for Pat Robertson 
She was a soldier in Robertsons invisible army 
There were two of mine that couldnt come because they were 
sick but there were four who surprised me says Mrs 
Pietraszewski 35 mother of two I knew them all as they came 
in I went out and personally met them so they wouldnt be afraid 
to go to the caucus 
When the heads were counted there were 64 and 43 of them gave 
the nod to Robertson 
Statewide Robertson finished second behind Bob Dole but ahead 
of Vice President George Bush a shock to many but not to some 
Robertson people who like Mrs Pietraszewski had been working for 
their candidate for months I told my family there will be lots 
of other Christmases but this ones different 
The Robertson ground troops new to politics and excited by 
success are starting to ask themselves if they have it within 
their power to put their man in office 
A lot of people have said well I agree with Pat Robertsons 
stands but I dont want to waste my vote the Rev Walter 
Holder pastor of the First Baptist Church told the Concord NH 
Monitor That was before Iowa My impression is now hes a little 
more electable There may indeed be a groundswell 
The Rev John Fortin of the Faith Christian Center in Bedford 
NH puts it this way If Pat is Gods man then somehow hes 
going to get in there But not without a lot of hard work and 
prayer 
And the Rev Ken Borchers pastor of the United Methodist Church 
in Ashland tells of a lunch that a group of clergymen had with 
Robertson After getting to know him as a person Borchers said 
We all laid our hands on him and prayed for him We prayed for 
strength and guidance and prayed if it is Gods will that he be 
elected 
Jeffrey K Hadden a University of Virginia sociologist and a 
Robertson biographer says Robertson came up with a masterstroke in 
insisting that three million followers sign petitions before he 
would decide to run The tactic gave Robertson an army 
He asked people to pledge that theyd work for him pray for 
him and give him money says Hadden Political historians may 
view it as one of the most ingenious things a candidate ever did 
These days Robertson soft pedals the churchbased foundation of 
his candidacy He says he should be thought of as a television 
network executive and the chancellor of a fully accredited graduate 
university To call him merely a TV evangelist he protests is 
bigotry and its an insult And it denigrates who I am and what I 
am and Im sick of it 
For all that most of Robertsons followers come out of the 
evangelical churches of America They know him best as a man of God 
and they speak of him often in language unblushingly tinged 
with theology 
I just believe Robertson is going to win says Gloria 
Widmann of Waterloo Iowa He operates in miraculous wonders in 
terms of what the Bible says prophecy healing miracles He 
operates just like Jesus did and he loves just like Jesus did And 
we need a man of God in the office 
In Port Huron Mich Billye Knoik who quit her job as a church 
secretary to work for Robertson scoffs at the term the press has 
given Robertsons political flock 
These are just your common everyday folks from various and 
sundry backgrounds and Pat is touching these people she says 
Mrs Knoik mother of three grown children got to know Robertson 
from watching the 700 Club on the Christian Broadcasting Network 
In New Hampshire where on Tuesday Robertson faces his first 
test in a primary Mrs Maria Farris 37 of Londonderry town 
chairman and Robertsons local coordinator says the conventional 
wisdom that Robertson will have trouble in a primary election 
has missed the point 
Its there she says of a Robertson postIowa surge 
Theres a tremendous force that hasnt been really identified in 
the normal political process 
Registration ended last weekend in New Hampshire and city and 
town clerks say they were so busy for three weeks they didnt have 
time to leave their offices and grab lunch 
The lines were long Nearly 1000 people registered in 
Manchester on a Saturday Many are firsttime voters Many 
registered undeclared meaning they can vote Democrat or 
Republican Secretary of State William Gardner estimates the late 
surge added 15000 to 25000 voters in a state where Ronald Reagan 
won the primary in 1980 with 73000 votes Gardner cant guess how 
many of the new registrants are Robertson supporters 
The Rev Keith Marsh a pastor at the Dartmouth Area Christian 
Fellowship in New Hamsphire says in 1986 about 50000 residents of 
the state gave money to the Christian Broadcasting Network 
After Iowa all the candidates flew to New Hampshire but 
Robertson went to Minnesota which holds caucuses Feb 23 and where 
a strong prolife movement has ties to fundamentalist churches 
Doles Minnesota cochairman Carl Ludeman says Jack Kemp is no 
longer Doles greatest threat We feel that in Minnesota we have 
only one competitor in grass roots organization thats Pat 
Robertson 
In Hawaii where Robertson won overwhelmingly in the Feb 4 
Republican caucuses GOP chairman Howard Chong credits a 60 percent 
rise in party registration tp Robertsons appeal 
Says Robertson cochairman Gene Ward We draw from mainstream 
conservatives evangelicals and those who know Pat from the 700 
Club 
In Iowa retiree Chuck Underwood of Des Moines a lay pastor 
says Robertsons appeal politicized the nonpolitical like 
himself 
Ive got to get with it Underwood tells a reporter Ive 
got to get involved Im ashamed to say thats the first caucus I 
ever attended 
Were Robertson people in Iowa told to be evasive to pollsters so 
the Robertson strength would come as a surprise 
No Underwood says People have a little bit of a problem with 
the role of the media They were tightlipped on the thing 
Guy Rodgers of Shenandoah Iowa a Robertson activist who has 
worked for a number of Christian causes We had a lot of people 
support Pat who we referred to as closet supporters I saw that in 
my own precinct I saw people we hadnt identified people we 
didnt know There were extra numbers here that we werent aware 
of 
The Rev David Nelms pastor a Des Moines Baptist Church says 
evangelical churches didnt outright support Robertson but they 
sure gave up preaching that politics is securlar business to be 
shunned in favor of the Lords work 
For years we heard Christians should stay out of politics 
he says Of late our leaders have encouraged the opposite
