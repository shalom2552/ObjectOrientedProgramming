A woman wounded by a spurned admirer in 
a shooting spree that left seven people dead says she was so afraid 
of the man she moved three times and sought a court order of 
protection 
Laura Black 26 who police say was the target of Tuesdays 
shootings at ESL Inc was haunted for four years by unwanted 
advances from Richard W Farley a former coworker her lawyer 
said Black was one of four people injured in the siege 
Black had asked a court to order Farley 39 to never bother her 
again but she was shot and seriously wounded in her office the day 
before her hearing authorities said 
I have been afraid of what this man might do to me if I file 
this action she said in her filing with the court However I 
am now at the end of my rope 
In the filing Black said she obtained an unlisted phone number 
and moved three times but Farley continued calling her at work 
driving by her house and following her to softball games 
San Jose Family Court Commissioner Lois Kittle who issued a 
temporary order against Farley on Feb 2 made it permanent 
Wednesday 
This was a consciousnessraising incident she said from the 
bench in tears It shows pieces of paper do not stop bullets 
Charges were being prepared against Farley who was being held 
in the Santa Clara County jail in San Jose prosecutor Alan 
Nudelman said Wednesday Police Capt Al Scott said he expected 
them to include multiple counts of homicide attempted murder and 
assault with a deadly weapon 
A portrait of Farley as a man with a deadly obsession but no 
apparent criminal background or pattern of job problems emerged 
from comments by authorities neighbors and former employers 
When police searched a motor home owned by Farley they found a 
stockpile of guns and ammunition along with cans of gasoline 
Scott said 
He had a lot of guns and a lot of gun knowledge apparently a 
lifetime hobby the captain said 
Police say Farley was a Texas native who never married served 
11 years in the Navy with an honorable discharge and started at 
ESL a Silicon Valley defense contractor in November 1977 It was 
there that he met Black 
When Farley failed to get dates with Black he began living in a 
fantasy world Blacks attorney Mary Bird said Farley took 
pictures of Black and used them to document their makebelieve 
life Bird said 
Neighbors said Farley who lived in a dilapidated cottage with 
peeling paint was a loner who never said hello to anyone 
Farley was fired in May 1986 from his 36000ayear job as a 
software development engineer after sending a letter threatening 
Blacks life said Jerry DeRuntz a company manager 
The attack said Scott and Lt Ruben Grijalva who negotiated 
the gunmans surrender was Farleys way of making a point that 
he wouldnt tolerate being spurned by Black or laughed at by other 
ESL employees 
He was in love with her from the first moment he saw her 
said Grijalva It was her smile 
After being fired Farley found other computer industry jobs 
and his current employer Sunnyvalebased Covalent Systems 
released a statement Wednesday saying his work was satisfactory and 
there was no indication whatsoever of problems 
At ESL which does such work as outfitting military spy planes 
president Robert Kohler met with about 2000 grieving employees 
outside the plant Wednesday He said the deaths were like losing 
members of your own family 
The company said the shootings did not result from any lapse of 
security Scott agreed noting that Farley gained access by 
blasting his way through a computercontrolled door 
The building where the shootings took place was closed 
Wednesday but other buildings at ESL were open 
Black suffered chest shoulder and spine injuries in the 
shooting 
Killed were Joe Silva 43 of Sunnyvale Buddy Williams 23 San 
Jose Glenda Moritz 27 Sunnyvale Ron Reed 26 Sunnyvale Helen 
Laparter 49 Sunnyvale Lawrence J Kane 46 San Jose and Ron 
Doney 36 Manteca 
Injured in addition to Black were Richard Townsley 44 of San 
Jose wounded in the chest arm leg and hand Gregory Scott 39 
of San Jose shrapnel wounds to the face and Patty Marcotte of San 
Jose who broke her forearm trying to break a window to escape
