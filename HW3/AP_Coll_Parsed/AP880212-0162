Gov Richard Celeste signed into law 
Friday emergency legislation that enables the state to assess the 
economic impact of takeover bids by foreign corporations 
The law which takes effect immediately and expires July 1 was 
prompted by Campeau Corps billion bid to acquire or merge with 
Federated Department Stores Inc Celeste said 
Campeau is headquartered in Toronto Federated is based in 
Cincinnati 
With the help of this bill we will use every resource 
available to investigate the impact of this offer and take whatever 
action is necessary to prevent the loss of jobs in the Cincinnati 
area Celeste said 
Separately Campeau Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert 
Campeau cautioned that any attempt by Federated to enter into 
agreements with other firms would be met with a vigorous legal 
challenge 
In a letter to Henry Kravis of the leveragedbuyout firm of 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp Co Campeau noted that it has been 
widely reported that KKR has expressed interest in Federated 
Campeau said the firm cannot enter into such arrangements 
without our having a full and fair opportunity to compete with any 
offer you make including providing us with any information 
provided to you or any other third parties 
Under Ohios new law foreign businesses trying to acquire an 
Ohio business are required to disclose financing plans and any 
intent to sell the target companys assets to pay for the 
acquisition 
Companies must make the disclosure to the Department of 
Development which is then authorized to conduct an economic impact 
review and also can involve other departments including commerce 
and taxation 
This legislation protects target corporations with a 
considerable presence in Ohio by requiring bidders to explain their 
financing plans the governor said 
Celeste said serious questions have arisen about the amount of 
debt involved in the transaction 
John Chester a Columbus attorney representing Federated said 
Thursday that enactment of the bill should send a signal to 
Torontobased Campeau that Federated has obtained some of the 
protection it wanted 
A companion bill requested by Federated effectively has been put 
on hold The measure would have expanded Ohios existing 
antitakeover law to include certain nonOhio corporations licensed 
to do business in the state 
But lawmakers said there were substantial constitutional 
questions and other concerns about the bill 
Campeaus 54 billion 61pershare offer to merge with 
Federated was made as an alternative to its outstanding 42 
billion hostile tender offer 
Federated employs about 16000 people in Ohio and has a payroll 
of 237 million annually
