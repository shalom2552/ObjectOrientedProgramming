International Business Machines Corp on Monday 
announced a new design and new internal software for its largest 
computers continuing a chain of enhancements dating back to the 
first System360 in 1964 
The worlds dominant maker of mainframe computers IBM controls 
about 70 percent of the market The huge computers are used by the 
government and almost all major businesses 
IBM said the improvements would allow computers to obtain access 
to information more rapidly and allow users to develop new programs 
for their own needs more easily 
IBM also unveiled new models of its biggest line of mainframe 
computers the 3090 series and of its slightly smaller 4381 
series IBM said the new architecture a way of putting computers 
and data storage devices together would permit more productive 
use of existing computers 
The computer giant said the new operating system which governs 
the internal workings of a computer was a major new development 
comparable to the advent of the System360 in 1964 the System370 
in 1970 and the 370Extended Architecture of 1981 
The Enterprise Systems Architecture370 the new operating 
system can be used in IBMs 3090 and 4381 mainframe computers 
The ESA370 which controls the division of room in a computer 
data storage device allows computers to reach 16 trillion 
characters of data that are held in virtual storage That is 
8000 times greater than the virtual storage accessible with IBMs 
current operating system 
Information held in virtual storage can be retrieved almost as 
quickly as information held in the computers main memory 
IBM also announced a program for helping computers get at stored 
information more rapidly IBM said the program called Data 
Facility Storage Management is the most significant storage 
advancement in 20 years 
It also announced a piece of hardware that allows the 3090 to 
run as if it were four different computers in one 
These new products have important benefits to our customers 
now and help them plan for the future by setting a path for IBM 
large system growth into the next decade said Edward Lucente 
IBM vice president and group executive in the US marketing and 
services group 
They establish a new foundation for future enhancements that 
will continue to help our customers take advantage of these new 
capabilities he said in a statement 
IBM said the 3090 models 280E and 500E would cost 49 million 
and 965 million respectively The 280E will be available in the 
second quarter of the year while the 500E will be available in the 
third quarter 
The 4381 models 91E is priced at 550000 and the 92E is priced 
at 920000 Both will be available in November
