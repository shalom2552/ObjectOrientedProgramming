Democrat Albert Gore Jr campaigning with 
country music star Johnny Cash on Friday cited increased violence 
and suicide among children as he defended his wifes efforts 
against raw music lyrics 
What she has said is parents should be more aware that younger 
and younger children are targets of increasingly brutal and 
explicit material Gore said 
Cash a country performer for more than 30 years appeared with 
Gore at a small rally in the railroad yard of the Virginia Museum 
of Transportation and planned to travel with the Democratic 
presidential candidate to New Hampshire But snow in New England 
forced Gore and Cash to abandon those plans and return to 
Washington to await better weather 
Gore who has campaigned less in New Hampshire than most of his 
rivals while concentrating on the Southern primaries hoped to make 
it to that state before Saturdays Democratic debate 
Cash wearing his trademark blackonly attire enthusiastically 
endorsed Gore and said his fellow Tennesseean was the only 
presidential candidate he has ever publicly backed 
You know the Soviet Union has a strong energetic man Cash 
told about 150 people who stood in subfreezing temperatures 
What we need is a strong energetic young brilliant man and 
thats what we have in Al Gore 
Cashs presence prompted numerous questions at a later news 
conference about Gores wife Tippers work against sexual and 
violent lyrics in rock music 
Gore responded by saying there were epidemics of teen pregnancy 
and suicide and an epidemic of violence by children against 
children 
In the face of that I think its legitimate to ask what is 
the effect of children seeing 18000 murders on television by the 
time they graduate from high school What is the effect of 
increasingly explicit material on younger and younger children 
Gore said 
Im very proud of what she has done 
He said she has never sought to impose censorship but favors 
voluntary efforts aimed at letting parents know what is contained 
in the music their children listen to 
Tipper Gores wellpublicized efforts in that cause have brought 
criticism from some in the entertainment industry But Gores poll 
takers and strategists say they find little opposition to his 
candidacy in the South or elsewhere based on his wife 
Cash said he saw no point in trying to censor what his child 
might hear in music but added I really dont think that Tipper 
Gore is advocating that kind of censorship anyway 
Mrs Gore did not accompany her husband but two of their 
children Albert Jr age 5 and Karenna 14 traveled with him 
As Gore and Cash spoke Norfolk Southern freight trains rolled 
by noisily just a short distance away prompting Gore to call on 
Cash to sing a train song Cash a country music performer for 
more than three decades complied 
Virginias attorney general Mary Sue Terry who is expected to 
run for governor next year appeared with Gore as did the 
districts Democratic congressman Jim Olin and the citys 
Republican Mayor Noel Taylor 
Gore blasted President Reagan for a lack of leadership on the 
deficit and the economy He said that after the stock market drop 
last October Reagan had nothing of substance to say 
The president came out of the White House and said What 
the helicopter engines were going you know He said They tell me 
Ive got to go Gore said Well hes got a point there 
Gore pinning his presidential hopes on the Southern primaries 
on March 8 contended that Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis is 
unlikely to gain great momentum out of an expected win in New 
Hampshire before the campaign turns South 
Its essentially a twoperson race in most of the South he 
said referring to himself and Jesse Jackson
