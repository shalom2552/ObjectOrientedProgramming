Federal Reserve policymakers decided in 
December that the easing of credit instituted by the Fed after the 
October stock market plunge was no longer needed according to 
minutes of the meeting 
The minutes released Friday showed that the majority argued in 
favor of ending efforts to push interest rates lower also because 
of concerns about the decline of the dollar 
Lower US interest rates put downward pressure on the value of 
the dollar because foreigners earn less on their dollardenominated 
investments 
The action was approved at a scheduled meeting of the Federal 
Open Market Committee on Dec 15 and 16 and reaffirmed during an 
unannounced telephone conference call Fed officials held on Jan 5 
Immediately following the record 508point drop in stock prices 
on Oct 19 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan promised that 
the central bank would do everything necessary to ensure that the 
economy had sufficient credit to weather the oneday loss of 500 
billion in wealth 
The December action was approved on a vote of 92 while the 
reaffirmation of the policy in January carried by a 101 vote 
Martha Seger dissented both times arguing that financial 
markets remained too unsettled to justify a shift away from 
easier credit 
Since the December meeting the dollar has stabilized in part 
because of massive intervention by the Fed and other central banks 
to prop up the currencys value on foreign exchange markets 
Fed policymakers met again Tuesday and Wednesday amid 
speculation by some private economists that the central bank has 
launched further easing moves These economists noted that a 
variety of interest rates including mortgage rates have been 
headed lower in recent weeks
