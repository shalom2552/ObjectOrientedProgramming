People who live on Barlow Street say they support 
two neighbors who face arraignment on charges of setting a house on 
fire The residents cheered because they said the house had been 
used since last summer to sell crack 
Residents of the workingclass neighborhood where blacks whites 
and AsianAmericans live side by side said the two men acted as 
good neighbors 
Robert Firmstone said hes taking up a collection to help pay 
legal expenses for Angelo Bruce Parisi 28 and Perry Kent 29 
who are free on 10000 personal bond pending a Feb 26 arraignment 
on two charges each of burning property 
Both men have admitted setting the fire but insist they are not 
vigilantes and their lawyers say they were acting in self defense 
They are not vigilantes said Firmstone who has lived on 
Barlow Street for 15 years They are not going around the city 
burning down crack houses 
Ninety percent of the people in this block support them When 
they set the fire everybody in the neighborhood knew they were 
going to do it and they knew why they were going to do it he 
said 
This is a peaceful neighborhood said Firmstone This 
isnt a rich street but we look out for each other 
However Guy Martin another neighbor said I dont agree 
with their means They did take the law into their own hands But I 
dont want a crack house in my neighborhood They did what they 
thought they had to do 
The suspected crack house was destroyed by fires Oct 28 and 
Nov 15 Parisi an unemployed landscaper and Kent an unemployed 
machinist are accused of dousing the house with gasoline and 
setting the blazes 
Lt Jon Bozich an arson investigator said he plans to question 
neighbors who told reporters they contributed to a neighborhood 
collection for the gasoline Neighbors could face conspiracy 
charges fire officials have said 
Earlier Parisi said he and Kent collected less than 10 from 
neighbors to buy gasoline and a can 
If I could do it over I would call the police Parisi said 
I wouldnt do this again Its scary 
Kent said he was so distressed he has sent his wife and three 
children out of town We did it for our kids now were not sure 
well be around to see them grow up he said 
Maybe we overreacted but something had to be done Parisi 
said All we want is a peaceful quiet neighborhood 
Renee Lynch president of Detroit Area Residents East applauded 
the goal of Parisi and Kent but not their method 
I think people get frustrated Lynch said You call those 
drug telephone numbers and the police and you dont get any 
feedback Those two men were thinking of their children I dont 
think they should go to jail though I fear they will be made an 
example of
