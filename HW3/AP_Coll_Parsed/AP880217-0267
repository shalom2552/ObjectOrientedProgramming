US industrial output rose 02 percent while housing 
construction dropped by 19 percent in January the governemnt 
reported today 
The Federal Reserve said production at American factories mines 
and utilities increased for the fourth consecutive month despite 
a sharp drop in the production of autos following gains of 04 
percent in both November and December 
Those gains helped push the production level up by 6 percent in 
the past 12 months providing further evidence of the strength in 
the manufacturing sector 
The weaker dollar has been a major benefit to US industry 
making American products competitive once more on overseas markets 
and boosting exports to record levels 
Earlier the Commerce Department said Januarys seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of housing construction stood at 138 million 
units a month the lowest level since the end of the last recession 
Some analysts had expected a small rebound in the building of 
new homes and apartments following Decembers 155 percent plunge 
in December 
They have been keeping a close eye on the housing sector since 
it is often one of the first sectors to turn down at the start of a 
new recession 
But the jury is still out on that question 
On Tuesday Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspans remarks 
that the economy appears to be balanced riled the bond market but 
Wall Street ignored him and gave the Dow Jones industrial average 
its best showing in more than a month 
Greenspans comments in a Washington speech Tuesday were 
interpreted by bond traders as a signal that the nations central 
bank wont move quickly to push interest rates down to stimulate 
the economy as had been widely expected He spoke against a 
background of government statistics that suggested the economy 
isnt slowing down despite the warning signs given by the stock 
crash four months ago On Friday for example the government 
reported that the nations trade deficit shrank in December and 
inflation increased 
The 30year Treasury bond the most closely watched issue fell 
about 10 per 1000 in face value after Greenspan spoke though 
the price recovered somewhat later The bonds yield which moves 
inversely to price and can be a sensitive indicator of interest 
rates rose to 846 percent from 843 percent late Friday 
On Wall Street investors largely overlooked Greenspans remarks 
and the bond markets reaction buying stocks in a lateafternoon 
rally that baffled strategists because signs of higher interest 
rates usually depress stock prices 
The Dow Jones average rose 2271 points to 200597 its first 
finish above 2000 since Jan 8 when computerized selling and a 
presidential panels report on the October stock crash sent the 
index down 14058 points to 191131 
The value of all US stocks rose 169 billion Tuesday 
according to the Wilshire Associates 5000 Equity Index 
In other economic news Tuesday a national real estate trade 
group said sales of existing homes steadied in 1987 at close to 4 
million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the stock market 
collapse 
The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes and condominiums totaled 3885 million units 
last year down 03 percent from the 1986 level of 3897 million 
units Sales in both years were the fastest pace of this decade
