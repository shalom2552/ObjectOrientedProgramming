Rep Thomas Luken DOhio wants the Federal 
Trade Commission to explain why it decided not to pursue an 
indepth review of an attempted takeover of Cincinnatibased 
Federated Department Stores Inc 
Luken chairman of the House Energy and Commerce transportation 
subcommittee has scheduled a hearing on the matter for today 
The commissioners of the FTC were scheduled to testify as was 
Sen Howard Metzenbaum DOhio chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
antitrust subcommittee Metzenbaum has said the takeover raises the 
possibility of reduced competition in several cities higher 
prices less consumer choice and a substantial loss of jobs 
Luken said Tuesday that documents suggest the FTC based its 
decision on state and regional impact rather than on individual 
metropolitan areas 
He said that according to an FTC memorandum the agencys staff 
recommended against seeking additional information on the proposed 
merger between Federated and Campeau Corp of Toronto on the basis 
of the competitive situations in Florida and New England as a whole 
In other cases of department store mergers Luken said the FTC 
has used individual metropolitan areas to gauge potential 
anticompetitive effects 
Theyve used a totally false basis for denying the heart of 
competition he said 
FTC spokeswoman Susan Tichnor said the agency declined comment 
Federated operates about 650 retail stores in 36 states and had 
sales exceeding 11 billion in 1987 
Its holdings include the New Yorkbased chains of Bloomingdales 
and Abraham and Straus Lazarus in Cincinnati Filenes of Boston 
Burdines of Miami Richs in Atlanta Bullocks and Bullocks 
Wilshire in Los Angeles and I Magnin in San Francisco 
Campeau a retailing and real estate development company on 
Tuesday sweetened its bid for Federated to 66 a share or about 
585 billion in cash but Federated rejected it saying Campeau 
lacked adequate financing for the takeover 
According to the FTC memo of particular competitive concern 
were Federated stores in New England and Florida that compete with 
Campeaus Jordan Marsh stores 
However the FTC said that based on 1982 figures Campeau held 
only 15 percent of the New England department store market compared 
with 77 percent for Federated In Florida each company held 164 
percent of the market the FTC said 
Although this acquisition would combine the first and 
thirdlargest department store chains in the country we do not 
feel that it raises competitive concerns the memo concluded 
Campeau bought Allied Stores in December 1986 then sold several 
divisions of the company However it retained several retailing 
chains including Ann Taylor Brooks Brothers and Jordan Marsh 
Ohio politicians are worried that Campeau will buy Federated 
sell major portions of the company and fire or lay off large 
numbers of its employees Federated operates 63 stores in Ohio 
employing about 16000 workers in the state 
Federated has spurned Campeau three times Federated rejected 
Campeaus initial 47ashare 42 billion takeover offer as 
inadequate 
It later turned down an improved 61ashare 54 billion bid 
as well as Tuesdays increased offer because it was not convinced 
Campeau had the necessary financing
