All airports in the Philippines have 
been put on alert following reports that ousted President Ferdinand 
Marcos or his relatives may attempt to return to the country an 
air transport official said today 
Victorino Palpallatoc chief of the Air Transportation Office 
issued the alert order Friday to the countrys 86 airports his 
spokesman said 
The spokesman who demanded anonymity said the order was just 
a reminder of a longstanding order issued nearly two years 
ago when President Corazon Aquinos government revoked the 
passports of the Marcos family 
Marcos and his wife Imelda have been living in exile in 
Honolulu Hawaii since the February 1986 civilianmilitary uprising 
that ended Marcos 20year rule and swept Mrs Aquino to power 
The alert came three days after Mrs Marcos and two aides 
reportedly were about to board Philippine Airlines flight for 
Manila but changed their minds at the last minute 
In his new order Palpallatoc told airport officials to be on 
the lookout for any unusual movement of persons who are 
restricted from entering the country 
The order did not mention the Marcoses by name but they are 
included on a list of persons not allowed to return to the country 
Palpallatocs spokesman said 
Joe Lazo a Honolulu travel agent and confidante of Mrs Marcos 
said the former first lady wanted to return to Manila to rendezvous 
with her daughter Imee Manotoc who reportedly lives in Morocco 
and wants to come home for medical treatment
