report that a Japanese cargo vessel had struck a mine off the 
United Arab Emirates saying it now appeared that the ship may have 
collided with a recently sunken freighter 
The US helicopter carrier Okinawa headed down the gulf to 
return to the United States with the four helicopter mine sweepers 
sent to the region last August 
The RH53D Sea Stallions originally eight in number spent six 
months searching for mines ahead of convoys of USflagged Kuwaiti 
tankers Although they found none the aircraft accomplished their 
mission of protecting the convoys US officers say 
The Kuwait news agency quoted French naval officials in Paris as 
saying the corvette Montcalm today had used gunfire to destroy an 
old mine earlier found floating in the northern gulf 
It gave no other details but it appeared the mine may have been 
one previously spotted by Saudi Arabias navy several days ago The 
mine sank and was lost the Saudis reported

believed laid by Iran that its navy had found and destroyed in 
recent months

suffered mysterious damage to its bottom while sailing off Dubai on 
Wednesday may have struck the submerged superstructure of the 
Greekowned motor vessel Mare

water off the port of Jebel Ali on Feb 4 while being towed to a 
shipyard It had been gutted by fire in an Iranian gunboat attack

heading for home port at San Diego 
Its departure will eventually scale down the force from 17 to 16 
ships including six ocean minesweepers that arrived in November to 
replace the helicopters

from the US task force operating in the Arabian Sea outside the 
gulf in support of the navys escort operations
