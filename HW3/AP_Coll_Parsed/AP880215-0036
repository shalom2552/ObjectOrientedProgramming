If Pete du Pont and Bruce Babbitt stumble in 
this weeks New Hampshire primary as badly as they did in Iowa 
future candidates may think twice before arguing for any changes in 
the 260 billion Social Security program 
Whatever the fate of their candidacies it is almost certain 
that Social Security will remain an issue in this campaign just as 
it has been in the last three national elections 
What the surviving candidates are likely to be debating 
however is not du Ponts idea for allowing young workers to open 
taxfree retirement accounts or Babbitts call for taxing all of 
wealthy retirees benefits but who can offer the most ironclad 
promise to keep those Social Security checks and costofliving 
increases coming 
Concern about Social Security is in the bone marrow of the 
electorate said Democratic pollster Peter Hart 
Six years ago when Social Security had barely enough money in 
the till to pay benefits on time each month senior citizens had 
something to worry about 
But after the bipartisan rescue plan of 1983 which increased 
some taxes froze benefits for six months and raised the retirement 
age to 67 in the next century the Social Security system began 
rolling up big surpluses The economic spurt after the 198283 
recession and the sharp drop in unemployment hastened its recovery 
Social Securitys trust funds started this year with 67 
billion By next January they will have grown to 104 billion 
They will swell to 400 billion by 1994 and 1 trillionplus before 
the turn of the century 
Those big surpluses are the main reason the socalled notch 
babies are mounting a widening campaign to have their benefits 
raised closer to those born in 1916 and earlier Congress made a 
mistake in 1972 that gave the latter group more than they were 
entitled to The notch babies primarily the 7 million people born 
between 1917 and 1921 contend they got cheated when Congress 
rejiggerred the benefit formula in 1977 
Several Democrats and Rep Jack Kemp RNY have promised to 
look into the issue of equity for the notch babies whose benefit 
increases would cost tens of billions of dollars 
Du Pont the former Delaware governor who contends the system 
will crash in the next century under the weight of the retired baby 
boomers unless drastic changes are made finished a distant fifth 
in Iowa 
Republican Pat Robertson who like du Pont favors moves to 
privitize Social Security finished a strong second but it was his 
stand on moral issues not pensions that galvanized his Iowa 
supporters 
Kemp the Republicans most vigorous defender of the status quo 
in Social Security was fourth but hoping to move up in New 
Hampshire with his unbridled attacks on Sen Bob Dole and Vice 
President George Bush for supporting a freeze on Social Security in 
1985 
Dole tells voters everywhere he goes about his role on the 
National Commission on Social Security Reform in 1983 when the 
Kansas senator helped hammer out a lastminute compromise that put 
Social Security back in the black 
You dont have to worry about it being broke You dont have 
to worry about getting your checks And there I made a 
difference says Dole who also points out that Kemp voted 
against the Social Security rescue plan The New York congressman 
says he didnt like its payroll tax increases 
Du Pont has accused Kemp of repeatedly misrepresenting his plan 
to allow workers to set up taxfree savings accounts if they 
relinquish future Social Security benefits Du Pont says Kemps 
attacks remind me of the demagoguery practices by the Democratic 
Party in the 1982 elections 
Dole and other Republicans have said it was the Democrats 
pounding on senior citizens fear of Social Security cuts or 
freezes that cost the GOP control of the Senate in 1986 
On the Democrats side Babbitt has called for a universal 
needs test to discipline government programs including Social 
Security and suggested making wealthier retirees pay income tax on 
all their benefits instead of half 
Gary Hart also has suggested taxing 85 percent of the benefits 
The other Democrats generally have been vowing to safeguard 
Social Security and its COLAs As Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri 
put it Were going to keep it away from the Republican budget 
knives forever 
But Social Securitys trust funds will always be tempting for 
budget knives They are expected to peak at 12 trillion 25 
trillion in todays dollars around 2020 then be drawn down to 
nothing by 2050 to help pay the baby boomers retirement 
Du Pont and Robertson have argued that even when the trust funds 
are full they will contain nothing but government IOUs To pay 
off those IOUs actually interestbearing Treasury bonds du 
Pont says we face a big tax increase 
When du Pont asked 80 people at a debate in Manchester NH 
how many thought Social Security would be there for them at 65 
three people raised their hands 
More scientific polls have shown young workers remain dubious 
about their personal prospects for Social Security 
But that sentiment has not translated into support for 
politicians such as du Pont and Babbitt who suggest overhauling or 
even tinkering with Social Security 
Social Security will always be a political issue simply because 
it is such a massive part of what the government does and the 
single largest source of income for 35 percent of the elderly 
Paul Maslin Simons pollster said The elites have attempted 
to move the debate in a direction the voters dont want to move 
yet Young voters dont expect to get Social Security themselves 
Maslin said but they do expect it to be there for their parents 
For all of the provocation the voters are still on the side 
of protection said Maslin They understand that if the 
government does not provide those benefits they are going to have 
to pay for their parents retirement or health problems
