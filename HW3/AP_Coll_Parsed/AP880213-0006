The charge of manslaughter is the 
latest weapon in the fight against heroin in this city of fishermen 
and artists where heroin overdose is the leading cause of death 
among young adults 
There have been 10 overdose deaths in less than 18 months in 
Gloucester population 25000 
Last week Louis Catalina 36 a fisherman became the first 
person in the history of Massachusetts to be indicted on charges of 
involuntary manslaughter in connection with a drug overdose 
He is accused of supplying a fatal dose of heroin to Grace 
Randazza 31 the mother of three 
Police later arrested Frank Auditore 41 a stevedore and 
charged him with manslaughter in the death of his sisterinlaw 
Anne Swanson 33 a former medical secretary and mother of one 
District Attorney Kevin Burke said both women died after 
injecting heroin of exceptional purity To convict on a charge of 
manslaughter a jury must find the defendant provided the drugs 
that caused the death and did so wantonly and recklessly he said 
Manslaughter charges carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison 
Gloucester is an extraordinary place having perhaps the 
highest per capita number of heroin addicts in the state said 
Burke 
It makes Gloucester an appropriate place to deliver the 
message that when theres an overdose the supplier just cant walk 
away 
Auditore said he has been trying to kick his own drug habit in a 
methadone program He pleaded innocent and was released on bail but 
said he has been evicted from his apartment and shunned by some 
acquaintances since being charged with manslaughter 
Im very sorry it happened to her but it was just a matter of 
time She was strung out he said of the death of Ms Swanson 
Theyre trying to scare people so they wont deal he told 
The Boston Globe They want people to think Hey someone might 
die I better not sell this heroin or I might be up for 
manslaughter 
But it wont work Heroins got people hooked so bad here 
its never gonna let go Its like AIDS which doesnt scare anyone 
either 
There is no known cure for AIDS which can be spread by sharing 
contaminated hypodermic needles 
Authorities say they arent sure why heroin has made such 
inroads in Gloucester 
Auditores brother Vincent 37 runs a dropin center for 
recovering addicts and said he was one of a small group of young 
men who made the first local heroin connection in 1968 
There arent many still alive who know how it started with a 
couple of guys from Boston who came down here in a big Lincoln 
Continental he said 
There were about 20 of us After that it just mushroomed 
Now you stand anywhere long enough in this city someones going 
to ask if youre looking to buy 
Police Chief Earland Worthley said overdose deaths began in 
1968 Police detectives made 87 heroin arrests last year 300 
percent more than in 1986 and they seized 1020 bags of heroin 
400 percent more than in 1986 
Estimates of the number of addicts in the city range as high as 
250 and the annual heroin trade reportedly is at least twice the 
26 million budget of the Police Department
