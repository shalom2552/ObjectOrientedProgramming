Gov Tommy G Thompson who made a crusade 
out of wooing business to the state is now threatening to sue 
Chrysler Corp for breaking what Thompson says was a promise to 
keep an auto plant open 
Thompson said Chrysler promised it would build OmniHorizon cars 
for five years at a Kenosha plant it took over when it bought 
American Motors Corp and that a suit will be filed if the state 
cant get a satisfactory settlement 
Chrysler officials have denied the plant closing would break a 
legal commitment We did not lie to anybody company chairman 
Lee Iacocca told reporters when asked about the Kenosha decision 
last week 
Late last month Chrysler announced it would halt production at 
the 86yearold plant The move will result in the layoff of about 
5500 workers by late summer 
Thompson maintained the company made the fiveyear pledge in 
exchange for a state promise of money to help retrain workers 
Wisconsins business image as well as the image of Chrysler and 
Iacocca could be affected if the case goes to court some 
legislators and business leaders say 
Stewart Macaulay a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law 
School said Wisconsin would have an iffy lawsuit but good 
arguments by the state could lead to an outofcourt settlement 
The audience the state is trying for now is Chrysler 
lawyers said Macaulay who has taught contract law for 30 years 
Thompson said West Virginia is preparing to go to trial with a 
similar lawsuit filed last fall after an Anchor Hocking Co glass 
factory closed in Clarksburg and put 940 people out of work 
He insists the lawsuit can be won even though there is no 
signed contract calling for autos to be produced in Kenosha for 
five years 
There is no reason for Chrysler not to live up to its 
agreement he said But we are going to explore every 
possibility to settling this as quickly as possible he added 
Members of the business community the Legislature and the legal 
profession express doubts about the wisdom of filing a suit 
Were working very hard to project Wisconsin as a 
businessfriendly state said James Haney president of the 
Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce a 3000member association 
Haney said a states reputation in the business community can be 
set back real fast if you arent careful 
This will undo all the governor has sought to do to improve 
the business climate in his first 13 months in office said 
Democratic state Sen Russell Feingold 
Were going to get a black eye in the business community 
across the nation said Feingold a frequent foe of the 
Republican governor 
But Thompson said failure to enforce the verbal agreement would 
send the wrong message They broke their word There is no other 
way to describe it he said 
State Attorney General Donald Hanaway has advised Thompson that 
despite the lack of a written contract Wisconsin has a clearly 
enforceable agreement with Chrysler 
Gerald Greenwald Chrysler Motor Corp chairman said company 
officials were sorry the plant had to be closed 
I guess you could say Chrysler was overly optimistic when it 
told workers and government officials it believed it could build 
the OmniHorizon in Kenosha for up to five years he said 
Hanaway said the state could sue for breach of contract and 
demand Chrysler keep the factory open or pay damages for 
unemployment benefits and other social costs of the mass layoff 
Damages could approach 100 million he said
