Jesse Jackson took a 1930sera train 
through New Hampshires Lakes Region Sunday to tell voters to get 
the country back on track by choosing him in Tuesdays 
presidential primary 
Standing on the back of the red caboose in Plymouth Jackson 
told about 300 supporters including 100 who came on school buses 
from Concord to stand up against what he calls economic 
violence 
Most poor people in America are not on welfare he said 
They work every day And when they get done working theyre 
still poor 
We the people can win he said 
The crowd endured 20degree temperatures and a brisk wind as 
they stood in front of the station its roof dripping with 
threeand fourfoot icicles 
Its worth all the cold feet said Holly Anathan who came 
from Boston to ride Jacksons train She said she liked the way he 
addressed the problems of lowerincome people 
Tenyearold Elijah Proule held up a Valentine that said I 
Love Jesse He handed Jackson the Valentine and a red rose 
Supporters then got on the Rainbow Express which chugged 
along at 10 to 15 miles per hour to Laconia 
A retired teacher from Nashua said I like the way he says 
things and hes mature Last night the others acted like 
children she said 
Banjo player Court Dorsey went from chilly car to car singing 
Its a Rainbow Train acoming 
We are winning together gether gether Jackson sang with 
Dorsey as the train passed Lake Winnipesaukee which was covered 
with ice fishing huts and snowmobile tracks 
And we are freezing here together Jackson added The coal 
stove in one of the three cars went out several times on the trip 
In Laconia and Tilton Jackson addressed crowds of between 200 
and 300 people and asked them repeatedly Whore you going to vote 
for 
Jesse they responded 
Ive stood with you On Tuesday I want you to stand with me 
he said 
Brenda Wright who had come to Tilton from Henniker said she 
wouldnt be standing with Jackson in the primary although she 
thought he was the best candidate 
I admire him greatly Hes done a lot for the underdog and it 
would be a thrill to see him in the White House she said I 
wont vote for him because I dont think he has a chance 
The train run by the Winnipesaukee Railroad Co cost the 
campaign 1500 to use Its trips are normally limited to fall 
foliage tours and some freight hauling 
Daris Dixon said he had come up with a group of 31 students from 
Cheyney University in Pennsylvania to canvass for Jackson 
This has been a great trip Id do it again in a minute he 
said 
A group of 10 and 11year old girls who shivered next to the 
stove near Jacksons car werent so sure 
Were never going to get home said one 
At the end of the line in Concord Jackson spoke to a rally of 
workers from Guilford Railway Co who have been on strike since 
Nov 13 He has held numerous rallies throughout his campaign 
supporting workers on strike 
Kathy Ramsey East Coast Coordinator for the Organization to 
Reach Acceptable Condititions for Railway Workers said she would 
back Jackson because he supports workers rights over corporate 
greed 
Hes the only one addressing the issues at hand she said
