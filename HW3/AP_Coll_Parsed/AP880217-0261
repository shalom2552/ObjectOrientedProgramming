Acting Premier Li Peng said Wednesday the 
government may expand its subsidies of major commodities to cut the 
inflation rate which hit 75 percent last year 
In a speech marking the Lunar New Year Li told a crowd of about 
6000 at the Great Hall of the People that the rapid rise in 
prices especially for food was Chinas most pressing economic 
problem the official Xinhua News Agency reported 
Xinhua said Li admonished governments at all levels to make 
price stability a priority and said the State Council Chinas 
cabinet is considering ways of expanding the subsidy program 
However we should not follow the road as we did in the past 
where prices were rigidly controlled by administrative means Li 
added 
Li did not specify which price subsidies would be increased or 
by how much or whether price supports would be introduced for 
nonsubsidized items 
Any such move would be a dramatic step away from the 
governments goal of gradually ending price controls and letting 
market forces take over 
Subsidies for nonstaple foods including vegetables have been 
gradually lifted in the past few years and the government has 
reduced the proportion of grain and other staples sold at 
subsidized prices 
The subsidies are believed to be a major contributor to the 
government deficit which rose 14 percent in 1987 to 8 billion 
yuan or 21 billion
