An Iraqi jet bomber fired a cruise 
missile within eight miles of the USS Chandler in the Persian Gulf 
after the American destroyer warned the warplane away with flares 
the warships captain said 
The Chandler which went to full alert was escorting four 
USflagged Kuwaiti tankers and neither it nor the merchant ships 
were hit No injuries were reported 
The Chandler and the tankers were not the apparent targets 
The incident occurred Friday night and was reported today by the 
Pentagons Persian Gulf media pool 
Pool reporters said the incident occurred at about 9 pm and 
that the Iraqi Badger bomber was on a trajectory toward the Iranian 
oil terminal of Sirri island The Iraqis reported hitting a very 
large maritime target or supertanker at Sirri island at about 
the same time 
Reporters could not determine whether any targets were actually 
struck at Sirri 
Iraqi planes occasionally have mistakenly hit fishing trawlers 
and other neutral vessels 
Last May an Iraqi jet fired a missile into the frigate USS 
Stark killing 37 American sailors Iraq said the pilot mistook the 
Stark for an Iranian warship and Washington accepted its apology 
Determining that the Sovietmade Badger was too close for 
comfort the Chandler fired two flares from its 5inch guns said 
the pool report filed through Washington by Norman Kempster of the 
Los Angeles Times 
Cmdr Steve Smith captain of the Chandler said he was 
concerned because Iraqi pilots often fire at radar blips without 
making sure what their targets are 
Having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time I 
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was 
heading toward us Smith said over the ships public address 
system after the incident 
He told pool reporters that the Iraqi pilot fired two C601 
missiles a 50milerange airlaunched version of the Styx which 
China copied in producing its betterknown Silkworms 
Smith said both missiles passed astern of the Chandler the last 
ship in the convoy but one suddenly changed course and passed 
along the starboard side of the ship before veering away Seconds 
later it detonated producing a bright flash 
Cruise missiles can have several guidance systems ranging from 
radio to infrared control 
In a report monitored in Cyprus the official Iraqi News Agency 
said Iraqi warplanes struck their target at 908 pm Friday It 
gave no other details Smith said Friday nights incident was the 
closest approach of a missile to the Chandler which has been in 
the gulf since Nov 25 US warships have been escorting reflagged 
Kuwaiti tankers through the gulf since July to protect them from 
attacks by Iran which accuses Kuwait of helping Iraq in the 
7yearold IranIraq war 
Smith placed his crew on general quarters the highest state 
of alert after the Badger which had earlier passed the convoy on 
a flight south along the gulf from Iraq turned back north and 
headed straight for the ship 
Smith said he was prepared to try to shoot down the missile if 
it appeared to be on a course that would strike any ship in the 
convoy He said he readied the Standard1 antiaircraft missile 
shoulderfired Stinger missiles and the automaticfiring Phalanx 
Gattling gun 
Smith said he informed the Badger by radio that it was 
approaching a US convoy and ordered it to turn back He said the 
Iraqi pilot who did not speak English very well did not seem to 
understand 
Smith said he then warned the Iraqi jet that he planned to fire 
two illumination rounds As soon as the flares went off Smith 
said the Iraqi jet turned sharply away from the ship and fired the 
C601s 
Iraqi warplanes usually fire radarguided missiles at Iranian 
naval targets and Iraq later announces the hits The planes are 
equipped mainly with heatseeking waterskimming Exocet missiles 
supplied by France 
Shipping executives said today that a Danish supertanker struck 
late Thursday in an attack initially blamed on Iran now appears to 
have been hit by Iraqi warplanes 
The executives had said Friday that the 339000ton Kate Maersk 
laden with Saudi oil was hit by an Iranian helicopter A Danish 
seaman was killed and three others were injured 
Salvage tugs that rushed to the aid of the Kate Maersk said 
there was a gaping hole above the ships waterline indicating it 
had been hit by an Exocet 
Iraq has been attacking Iranian tankers and oil facilities to 
cut off its oil revenues which finance its war The two have been 
fighting since September 1980 
Iran retaliates by attacking neutral merchant shipping mainly 
vessels involved in commerce with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia which 
Tehran accuses of supporting Iraq
