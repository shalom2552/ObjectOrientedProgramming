Britains foreign secretary told his Soviet 
counterpart today that arms reductions between the superpowers 
would be unacceptable if they give the Soviets an edge in mobile 
nuclear missiles and conventional and chemical weapons 
Sir Geoffrey Howe said the West wanted to see cuts in those 
areas as proof of what Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev calls 
new thinking 
We in the West will be happier when we can point to 
concrete evidence that new thinking does in practice make the 
Soviet Union an easier neighbor Howe said 
His remarks were prepared for delivery at a luncheon hosted by 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A Shevardnadze 
Howe arrived in Moscow on Sunday met with Shevardnadze today 
and planned to speak with Gorbachev Tuesday 
Howe and Shevardnadze also today planned to sign a memorandum in 
which their two countries pledge to work together to curb drug 
abuse and trafficking It is the first accord formalizing drug 
cooperation between East and West British diplomats said 
In his remarks Howe said Western Europeans are deeply concerned 
about their security now that the United States and Soviet Union 
have agreed to eliminate intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
In advance of Howes visit the official news agency Tass said 
without elaborating that the British government had taken a 
nonconstructive stand on the issue concerning further arms 
control measures 
Tass also criticized the British government for saying it 
supports a ban on chemical weapons but not denouncing the 
production of such weapons by the United States 
The antidrug agreement says Britain and the Soviet Union should 
jointly work to educate people about the evils of illicit drugs and 
cooperate in stopping the cultivation and trafficking of narcotics 
The accord also proposes cooperation in treatment and 
rehabilitation of drug addicts and legal cooperation in tracking 
suspected drug traffickers 
Details of the accord were spelled out by a Moscowbased British 
diplomat speaking with The Associated Press on the condition he 
not be named 
The Soviet Union only recently officially admitted having a drug 
problem particularly in the Central Asian republics where the 
climate is favorable for growing hashish Previously the official 
media contended drug abuse was only a Western problem 
The British government estimates 50000 Britons are dependent on 
heroin cocaine and other controlled substances not including 
marijuana
