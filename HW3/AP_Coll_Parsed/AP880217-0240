After months of debate the US Energy 
Department has decided not to restart the flawed and aging N 
Reactor one of four reactors supplying the US nuclear arsenal

The N reactor has been closed since January 1987 for about 70 
million worth of safety improvements prompted by the nuclear 
disaster that killed 31 people at the similarly designed Soviet 
nuclear plant at Chernobyl 
Energy Secretary John Herrington announced Tuesday the reactor 
at the Hanford nuclear reservation will be placed on cold 
standby status forcing about 2600 workers to be laid off in the 
next two years

The obscure cargo airline that Eastern 
Airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces 
questions about its safety record as the government decides whether 
it is fit to carry passengers 
Few air travelers have ever heard of Orion Air a North Carolina 
cargo carrier which serves such air freight companies as United 
Parcel Service Emery Air Freight and Purolator 
But if labor strife intensifies at Eastern many of that 
airlines customers may find themselves with tickets to fly Orion 
and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up 
scrutiny of the airline 
Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with Orion including 
the leasing of 26 of Easterns jetliners that call on the airline 
to take over much of Easterns routes if pilots and mechanics go on 
strike Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own pilots and 
ground workers Eastern officials said 
But the FAA has yet to approve Orion for passenger service and 
a senior agency official said Tuesday that an enforcement 
proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against 
Orion because of past safety violations

If the trend by many taxpayers to delay filing 
their federal tax returns continues to spread the federal 
government could feel the pinch right in the pocketbook 
Lawrence B Gibbs commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service 
notes that five years ago 14 percent of all individual returns 
were filed in January and 34 percent in April But last year only 
4 percent were filed during the first month and almost 40 percent 
in April 
If this trend were exacerbated by tax reform the sweeping 
1986 law it could jam the system by slowing down processing and 
the issuance of refunds Gibbs told a Senate Finance subcommittee 
Tuesday As a result there could be a high price to pay 
If we dont process returns within a 45day period after the 
return due date the government must pay interest on refunds he 
noted That due date is April 15
