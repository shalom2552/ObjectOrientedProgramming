The Marine officer kidnapped in Lebanon is 
one of at least 15 Americans on UN duty assigned to serve in a 
land so dangerous for US citizens that the State Department 
declared it offlimits in 1987 
The Pentagon says American officers chosen for the duty are 
under UN command and it has no control over where they serve 
Gunmen stopped the car of Lt Col William R Higgins 43 on a 
south Lebanon road Wednesday and abducted him Sources in Lebanon 
said he was returning from talks with officials of a moderate 
Shiite Moslem militia near the port city of Tyre 
Twentyfour other foreigners including eight Americans and two 
Scandinavian UN officials abducted earlier this month also are 
missing most believed to be hostages of Shiite extremists 
Terry Anderson 40 chief Middle East correspondent for The 
Associated Press has been held longest He was kidnapped March 16 
1985 
The United Nations said Higgins is one of 17 Americans in the 
76person truce observer group attached to the UN Interim Force 
in Lebanon or UNIFIL The Pentagon put the number of Americans at 
15 or 16 and neither could account for the discrepancy 
Not all observers are on duty at a given time Timur Goksel 
spokesman for UNIFIL in Lebanon said only six Americans actually 
were in the country 
One UN official said some governments have understandings 
about where their citizens serve peacekeeping or observer duty but 
the United States apparently did not in the case of Lebanon He 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
The United States is not involved in UNIFIL the peacekeeping 
organization to which Higgins group is attached but it has 36 
officers on observer duty in various posts with the UN Truce 
Supervision Organization a 299member force known as UNTSO 
commanded by Gen Martin Vadset of Norway 
Higgins is the senior American in UNTSO He had been on UN 
duty in the Middle East since June 1987 and assumed command of the 
observer group in Lebanon in midJanuary said Mario Zamorano a 
spokesman for UN SecretaryGeneral Javier Perez de Cuellar 
UNTSO was established in 1948 to monitor a truce the Security 
Council ordered between Israel and Arab nations and was the first 
UN peacekeeping organization in the Middle East Its observers 
are not armed 
Now serving with the organization are officers from the United 
States Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Canada Chile 
Denmark Finland France Ireland Italy the Netherlands New 
Zealand Norway Sweden and the Soviet Union
