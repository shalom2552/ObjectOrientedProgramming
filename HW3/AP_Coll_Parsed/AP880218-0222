A former security consultant to Lyndon LaRouche 
was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 50000 Wednesday 
for conspiring to obstruct an investigation of alleged fraud by 
supporters of the political extremist 
Roy E Frankhauser was the first of 14 individual and five 
corporate defendants in the case including LaRouche to stand 
trial LaRouche six aides and the five organizations are on trial 
in federal court here 
Frankhauser 48 of Reading Pa was convicted in December of 
helping LaRouche and his aides cover up alleged credit card and 
loan fraud by LaRouche followers during his 1984 presidential 
campaign 
Testimony indicated Frankhauser advised LaRouche to order 
fundraisers to leave the country burn documents and refuse to 
cooperate with investigators 
LaRouches attorneys have argued that they thought Frankhauser 
was working for the CIA and that in following his orders they were 
acting in the interest of national security 
Prosecutors and Frankhausers attorney said at his trial that 
Frankhauser lied about having CIA sources to impress LaRouche 
Frankhauser was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice 
which carries a maximium penalty of five years in prison and a 
250000 fine Assistant US Attorney John Markham requested a 
fouryear sentence 
Frankhauser pleaded for leniency saying he had to take care of 
his elderly mother and was planning to get married 
He also said that he frequently urged LaRouche to settle with 
the alleged fraud victims and that he had cooperated with the 
government 
Frankhauser also alluded to his past membership in the Ku Klux 
Klan the American Nazi Party and other extremist groups telling 
US District Judge Robert E Keeton Ive had enough of 
demonstrations 
In rejecting the plea for leniency Keeton said Frankhauser and 
his attorney had understated Frankhausers role in the conspiracy 
Markham earlier had told Keeton that two grand juries that 
investigated the alleged fraud were repeatedly stymied because 
LaRouche aides followed Frankhausers directions on how to obstruct 
the investigation 
LaRouche a candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential 
nomination is charged with conspiring to obstruct justice His 
trial began the week after Frankhauser was convicted and is 
expected to last several more months 
Three other LaRouche aides named in the 125count indictment 
have been granted later trials and three are fugitives
