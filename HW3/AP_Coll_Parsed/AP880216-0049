Pakistan today called on the Soviet 
Union to rejoin efforts at finding a formula for a future Afghan 
government rather than pulling troops out of that country 
unconditionally 
The Pakistan Foreign Ministry gave a statement to reporters 
saying that only by linking its proposed withdrawal to an agreement 
on an interim Kabul government could Moscow assure an end to 
Afghanistans nineyear civil war 
The withdrawal of its forces must be accompanied with 
arrangements to ensure peace and stability inside Afghanistan 
Otherwise the tragedy of Afghanistan will continue the 
statement said 
A ministry spokesman who cannot be named under news conference 
rules said Moscow has changed its position on a socalled 
twintrack approach to reaching a UNsponsored accord on ending 
the Soviets eightyear role in the war 
Kremlin leader Mikhail S Gorbachev issued a statement Feb 8 
setting a pullout date of May 15 provided that indirect talks 
between the Islamabad and Kabul governments produce an accord at 
least 60 days before that 
However Gorbachev also stated for the first time that a pullout 
would not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a 
transitional Afghan regime which would oversee such a pullout 
This according to Pakistani officials means that fighting 
between Afghanistans governing communists and the Afghan 
guerrillas could continue preventing the return of 35 million 
Afghan refugees who reside in Pakistan 
The spokesman also claimed that the absence of a political 
accord would make it impossible for Pakistan to abide by a key 
element of a peace agreement already accepted by Islamabad Kabul 
Washington and Moscow an end to foreign military aid to Afghan 
guerrillas 
If the refugees continue to camp just miles from this very 
porous border with Afghanistan it will be impossible for 
Pakistan to guarantee foreign noninterference he said 
The Islamabad and Kabul governments who have negotiated 
indirectly at Geneva through UN mediator Diego Cordovez have 
agreed on the principles of noninterference Afghanistans future 
status as a nonaligned country and the voluntary return of nearly 
5 million refugees from Pakistan and Iran 
At the next round of talks scheduled for March 2 they are to 
concentrate on the details of a withdrawal of Soviet troops 
Moscow and Washington would serve as guarantors of an accord as 
the United States gives substantial military aid to the Afghan 
guerrillas 
An agreement at the next Geneva round predicted by Cordovez and 
the Pakistanis alike would ostensibly mark the end of the Soviet 
armys involvement in the conflict 
The Moslem insurgency in Afghanistan began in 1978 before the 
Soviet intervention in December 1979 ostensibly at the request of 
the Moscowbacked Afghan communist regime and under the auspices of 
a Friendship Treaty 
Western analysts estimate 115000 Soviet troops are now fighting 
Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow the Marxist government
