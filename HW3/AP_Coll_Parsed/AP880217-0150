The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee 
on Wednesday approved a controversial bill that would require 
employers to provide health coverage to more than 20 million 
uninsured people 
The 106 vote came after nearly two hours of discussion ranging 
from denunciations of the insurance industry to a spirited debate 
over socialism and senators own health coverage 
Nevertheless when it was all over Sen Edward Kennedy the 
committee chairman was pleased 
Weve got a very positive attitude here he said The 
health issues on the national agenda Its going to be 
difficult for people to oppose this program 
The socalled minimum health bill sponsored by Kennedy 
DMass would require employers to offer a minimum package that 
includes hospital care doctor care diagnostic and screening 
tests prenatal and wellbaby care and limited mental health 
treatment The policies would cap outofpocket catastrophic costs 
at 3000 
Coverage would have to be offered to employees working 175 
hours a week or more and their dependents Small family farms 
would be temporarily exempted from coverage requirements 
New businesses would be able to phase in coverage over two 
years And under an amendment adopted Wednesday firms of five or 
fewer people would have five years to phase in benefits 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cover 
up to 23 million of an estimated 37 million people without 
insurance The new coverage would cost about 27 billion CBO said 
but it would be offset by about 12 billion in savings on 
administrative costs charity care and other outlays 
Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah said the Kennedy plan taxes Americans 
indirectly through businesses and called it socialism pure and 
simple 
A frustrated Sen Tom Harkin DIowa responded that 
congressional medical services all free and conveniently located 
in the Capitol are the most socialized medicine in America 
His voice rising Harkin continued Every senator takes part 
in it Every House member takes part in it But will they vote it 
for everyone else in America No 
Hatch equally frustrated said he would vote to end the free 
care for members of Congress but declined to stop his own visits 
immediately on principle 
Were a bunch of hypocrites Hatch conceded He added a 
moment later I have to admit I use it but I dont use it as 
much as most people I think 
Hatch called the Kennedy bill a 30 billion solution to an 8 
billion problem and likened it to using a sledge hammer to crack 
an egg 
Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen in a letter 
Tuesday to Kennedy also criticized the scope of the proposal He 
said it would impose an unduly intrusive and centralist solution 
one wholly disproportionate to the dimensions of the problem being 
addressed 
Bowen said the problem is limited in scope and could be 
resolved with sharply focused plans at the state level 
The only state with compulsory employersponsored health 
insurance is Hawaii Sen Spark Matsunaga DHawaii said 13 
percent of Hawaiians were uninsured before the plan compared to 5 
percent now Coverage requirements are more extensive than the 
Kennedy bill he said 
None of the businesses are complaining Businesses are 
prospering as usual Matsunaga said Its working beautifully 
I think it can work nationally 
Several senators criticized the insurance industry and small 
business groups for failing to help develop a consensus approach to 
closing the health insurance gap 
If the insurance industry refuses to participate itll be 
the government that does the job Then theyll come along and say 
Let us in let us in said Sen Lowell Weicker RConn As for 
small business they dont want any bill Period Over and out
