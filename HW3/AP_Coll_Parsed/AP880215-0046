Looking back on a life that spans nearly a 
century James Grote has no trouble deciding what he cares about 
most 
The fire service is the closest to my heart outside of the 
almighty God says Grote who at age 96 is the nations oldest 
fire marshal 
Seventyfive years ago Grote helped form the fire department 
that protects this town of 3200 residents on the lower Connecticut 
River Hes been working to save lives and property here ever since 
The fire service is something that Ive given dedication 
Grote said recently Ive been loyal Ive been faithful 
And hes been active 
After the department was formed in 1912 he rose through the 
ranks to become chief He was named fire marshal 66 years ago 
Although the appointment was for life Grote has never taken the 
job for granted When the state mandated certification for fire 
marshals in 1972 Grote then 80 undertook 12 weeks of training 
to gain his state license 
He still functions as he did when he was 60 says Chester 
First Selectman Robert Blair 
A photograph of Grote hangs in the Washington DC office of 
Robert B Smith executive secretary of the Fire Marshals 
Association of North America 
Grote is worthy of the recognition hes received Smith says 
Over the years he has spoken frequently on fire safety before 
the state legislature He advocated building sprinkler systems to 
legislators 50 years ago when the idea wasnt popular Later he 
championed smoke detectors 
Although he doesnt respond to every fire call these days Grote 
still drives to most department meetings His bright red car is 
mounted with red flashers and his business card says The Chief 
Grote who lives alone concedes to making a few concessions to 
age His daughters prepare his meals and hell accept an 
occasional ride to a firefighters meeting Two deputies often 
assist him on safety inspections where Grote admits he sometimes 
plays the tough guy 
If I come into your place of business and you may have half a 
dozen extinguishers and I find one behind the door Ill jump you 
for all the good ones that are in sight he said 
Its not that you try to be mean about it but you see this is 
an instrument that you might need Grote says 
The fire marshal who retired as the towns postmaster in 1970 
has held every top office in every fire association in the state 
Hes also served as president of fire chief associations in New 
England and on the national level 
Grotes home is a monument to his second career and first love 
His uniform festooned with gold braids and stars hangs where it 
can be quickly brought out for display Photographs trophies and 
plaques decorate the walls Amid the memorabilia are birthday 
greetings from Pope John Paul II and President Reagan 
Grote says hell give up his post when the time is right 
Let me be my judge he says I know when to back way from 
the table I know when Ive had enough of this that and the 
other
