An explosion blew a hole in a ferryboat 
at Limassol today as it was being readied to carry Palestinian 
deportees on a PLOsponsored protest voyage to Israel a Palestine 
Liberation Organization official said 
A man claiming to speak for the Jewish Defense League said the 
USbased group was responsible for bombing the ship at 
Limassol 
This is only a warning Next time we will bomb it with all the 
people on it he said in a telephone call to The Associated Press 
in Nicosia The man spoke English with an American accent and the 
call sounded longdistance But he would not say where he was 
calling from 
There were no immediate reports of injuries 
When asked if the JDL also was responsible for the killing of 
three PLO officers in Limassol on Sunday he said No comment 
and quickly hung up 
The JDL was founded in the early 1960s by Meir Kahane now a 
member of the Israeli parliament and head of extremist antiArab 
Kach Party Both Kach and the JDL espouse violence in the 
ArabIsraeli conflict 
There was no way to verify the identity of the purported JDL 
spokesman or to authenticate the claim 
In Jerusalem Kahane spokesman Baruch Marzel told the AP I 
think this is a great act to sanctify the Lord This is an 
excellent deed and I bless the people who did it 
Asked whether the JDL bombed the ship Marzel said he could not 
comment on such issues He said Kahane was abroad and could not be 
reached for comment 
Cypriot security sources insisting on anonymity said the PLO 
men killed in a carbombing in Limassol had been negotiating for 
the boat 
The slain officials were identified as Mohammed Sultan Mohammed 
Buheis also known as Abu Hassan Kassem and Marwan Kayyali 
Limassol port manager John Jijis interviewed by Israel radio 
said the craft the 6151ton Sol Phryne formerly sailed between 
Limassol and Haifa Israel He said it was bought on Saturday but 
definitely not by the PLO 
He said the explosion occurred at about a quarter to six this 
morning There will be an underwater survey to find out 
exactly what happened how big a hole there is and what repairs may 
be necessary 
One PLO official who spoke in Nicosia on condition of 
anonymity told the AP We are waiting for a decision by the 
PLO command We have to see if there is an alternative ship for 
the voyage 
PLO officials in Athens Greece confirmed the vessel they had 
planned to use on the voyage to Israel was damaged by a bomb in 
Cyprus 
The PLO had tried to launch the voyage from Greece but it was 
repeatedly delayed Before todays explosion the PLO had ordered 
the 130 Palestinian deportees and hundreds of observers and 
reporters that had planned to make the voyage to gather at Athens 
Airport to fly to Cyprus 
After the blast PLO officials stopped some reporters from 
boarding the plane to Cyprus where the voyage was due to start 
tonight 
PLO officials blamed Israel for the carbomb killings and also 
linked the attack to the PLOs efforts to find a vessel for the 
voyage to Israel 
Israel started this open war after losing the secret war 
concerning the ship the PLOs chief spokesman Bassam Abu 
Sharif said in Athens 
The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the 
Exodus in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned 
back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to Palestine 
In Jerusalem Israeli officials had no immediate comment on the 
ferryboat explosion but Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel 
had decided within the framework of various constraints not to 
let the PLO ship reach Israeli shores Israel army radio said 
Rabin speaking before the report of the explosion said Israel 
would stop the boat in the ways it sees suitable the radio 
said 
The ships captain Cleanthis Vlahopoulos a Greek from Athens 
told reporters at Limassol that he heard a loud bang at about 
530 am 
The crew he said quickly abandoned the vessel which began 
taking on water The boat was shaking and then it listed he 
said The crewmen later returned to the vessel 
Cypriot authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the 40yearold ferryboat was the only ship presently in Cyprus 
that would have been suitable for the voyage trip to Israel 
The PLO voyage called the Ship of Return was designed to 
focus condemnation of Israels policy of deporting Palestinians 
from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip seized from Jordan and 
Egypt in 1967 
The deportees includes taxi drivers laborers a university 
professor an Anglican bishop several mayors and city council 
members 
The voyage was supposed to end in Haifa but Israeli officials 
have said they will refuse to let the vessel enter their waters 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has condemned the voyage 
saying it was a declaration of war
