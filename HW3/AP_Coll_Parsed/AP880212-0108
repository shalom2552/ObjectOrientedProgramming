Wary of the turbulent public school 
system and seeking the best possible academic environment for their 
5yearold son Lawrence and Kim Dade enrolled the boy in private 
school 
The Dades were one of many families who last year chose private 
schools over the Little Rock School District which was beginning a 
vast desegregation plan involving crosstown busing and the 
reassignment of students and teachers to achieve racial balance 
White flight has been a problem in the district for some time 
But the Dades are black 
The Dades son Lawrence III attends McGraw Learning Institute 
the only black private school in Little Rock 
We wanted a positive strong school and basically a black 
school that was strong in academics Dade said Before we had 
taken our son to other schools and they didnt seem to have the 
care and really the motivation that it took Because my son was 
brought up in a more mixed environment more whites than blacks we 
thought it was time to have the reverse as well as have a good 
academic background 
The McGraw school has built a reputation for academic excellence 
since beginning as a preschool daycare facility in 1982 
Patricia McGraw founded the school in a converted grocery store 
near downtown soon after earning a doctorate in sociolinguistics 
at Washington University in St Louis 
I thought it was a necessity said Ms McGraw an English 
professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock For about 
20 years Ive taught on the college level and it has been my 
experience that many black students do not use the language well 
even after 12 years of schooling They do not feel good about 
themselves and generally most of them need something that has 
been lacking in the school systems 
In the beginning most of the pupils were the children of Ms 
McGraws students at college 
About 60 students mostly children of business and professional 
people now attend the institute More than half are preschoolers 
the rest in kindergarten through third grade 
The institute is certified by the state to teach through sixth 
grade and has a long waiting list 
Students are taught basic reading writing mathematics 
geography science music and dance and learn French as well as 
English Special emphasis also is placed on language development 
and computer training 
As important to most of the students parents Ms McGraw said 
are the lessons their children are taught in cultural awareness and 
social skills and the experience they get in being where blacks are 
the majority 
A very crucial and important part of our curricula is to be 
sure that these young people have good feelings about themselves 
and their people Ms McGraw said Most often we are told very 
little about how we happened to be where we are At this school 
we teach young people parts of African and AfroAmerican history 
that can make them feel good about themselves That I know they 
dont get anywhere else 
These little folk come from a people that has been greatly 
neglected in this society so they need some special kind of 
emphasis to make them know that they are really something awfully 
great she said I think thats what we give them 
The school is not for everyone Ms McGraw conceded Many 
families cannot afford the tuition and fees which total about 
2650 annually for the 12month program 
The school has several pupils of mixed race and one white child 
attends the afterschool program But its mostly black enrollment 
and its emphasis on black culture have discouraged some black 
parents Ms McGraw said 
Many black parents have been conditioned to believe that 
things cannot be good if they their children are not mixed with 
white she said 
The small enrollment enables the schools five fulltime and two 
parttime teachers to give extra attention to individual students 
the one feature cited most by parents who enroll their children at 
McGraw 
Alma Stewart described her 5yearold son Curtis as a slower 
learner who has to be motivated 
He needs to be pushed Some teachers classrooms at public 
schools are overcrowded and they dont take the time that they 
need to take to push our kids Mrs Stewart said Thats my 
reason for sending him here 
Shelly WilkinsRobinson said her daughter was further advanced 
academically than some other 4yearolds but was not getting the 
educational base she needed at another school 
At McGraw shes already reading and knows phonetics numbers 
alphabets The way the teachers here have worked with her she 
knows now that she can read almost anything 
Several students who got their early academic training at McGraw 
have advanced rapidly in the public school system 
One 7yearold Khiela Holmes ranked in the top 1 percent in 
the nation in mathemathics on a national standardized test she took 
a year ago On average firstgraders in the Little Rock district 
ranked at the 57th percentile among firstgraders nationwide who 
took the Metropolitan Achievement Test in the 198687 school year 
accordiing to Sue Tadlock a district evaluation and testing 
specialist 
Khiela completed kindergarten at 5 had gone through the 
firstgrade math program within two months of her first year at 
public school and was doing thirdgrade math work by the time she 
reached second grade She also excelled in reading English and 
science 
Khiela started at McGraw at 2 and stayed there through 5 We 
feel that a lot of her ability now is attributable to what McGraw 
did said her father Tracy Holmes All those years she had 
oneonone attention she excelled in all her studies and she 
enjoyed what she was doing 
Thats the key he said They made her feel confident in 
what she was doing She felt good about herself 
A study by the Urban League of Arkansas concluded that black 
students in the state have not achieved in school at a competitive 
rate and it questioned whether they receive adequate early 
academic preparation in public schools 
Without appropriate preparation during early school years the 
future academic achievement of black students is left to chance 
it said 
Charles M Hodge author of the study said the McGraw school is 
a good alternative particularly for younger students to public 
schools which he said are largely insensitive to the needs of 
blacks 
That the school is predominantly black and emphasizes black 
culture is not inconsistent with desegregation efforts said Hodge 
dean of the University of Central Arkansas College of Education 
In fact theyre probably doing more in addressing the issues 
of a multiracial society he said
