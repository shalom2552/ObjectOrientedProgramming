Nearly 850 airline flights to and from 
Florida and the Southeast were delayed when a flight data computer 
system failed for three hours federal officials said 
The malfunction Friday night affected flights in airspace 
bordered by central Florida Alabama and North Carolina said Paul 
Pascel supervisor at the Federal Aviation Administrations 
Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center 
You could call it a major problem but not a safety problem 
said FAA spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta It slowed down flights 
at any airport within the center or through the center area 
A severed cable left the Jacksonville center idle between 509 
pm and 814 pm Friday Barker said Orlando International 
Airport and Tampa International Airport both reported 25 flights 
delayed as much as an hour he said 
The computer system automatically logged the name of the 
airline type of aircraft route and altitude When the system 
crashed all departures and arrivals were halted until the 
information could be transmitted among the various airport control 
towers by telephone and teletype 
The Jacksonville center controls thousands of miles of airspace 
and about 6250 flights a day Pascel said It is one of 20 such 
traffic control centers in the United States
