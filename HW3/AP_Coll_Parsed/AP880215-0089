About 75 homosexuals held a St Valentines Day 
kissin outside St Patricks Cathedral to protest the Roman 
Catholic churchs attitude toward homosexuality 
The display of hugging and kissing during Sunday Mass was the 
latest in a series of demonstrations at the cathedral by Dignity 
an organization of gay and lesbian Catholics that has been barred 
from using church facilities 
In contrast to the previous week when two dozen demonstrators 
were arrested there were no arrests Sunday as protesters kissed 
each other blew kisses toward the cathedral and handed out 
chocolate kisses 
This is for solidarity and the unity of the gay and lesbian 
community said one organizer Neil Broome We feel we have the 
right to assemble before the church to show the affection between 
us without fear of reprisal Besides its Valentines Day Whats 
more appropriate than doing it in front of a cathedral
