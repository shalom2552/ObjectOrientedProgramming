Cultural differences and national pride 
distinguish Russian from Estonian and divide parent from child in 
Estonia home of a small ethnic group caught between stronger 
neighbors for centuries 
Dissidents plan protests Feb 16 in Lithuania and Feb 24 in 
Estonia to mark the days when the Baltic republics declared their 
independence from Soviet Russia months after the Bolshevik 
revolution of 1917 
Last August in an event dissidents say showed the authorities 
they had lost control thousands of people marked the anniversary 
of a secret agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union 
that led to the 1940 Soviet takeover of Estonia Latvia and 
Lithuania 
Soviet authorities now are encouraging the republics growing 
nonBaltic populations to learn the native language and in some 
cases are seeking to restrict immigration from other parts of the 
Soviet Union 
People of the Baltic nations very different ethnically from the 
Soviet Unions dominant Slavic population always have maintained a 
strong cultural and ethnic identity 
One of the Estonian dissidents is 21yearold Tina Hallik 
daughter of faithful Communist Party members 
People think if Im free if Im not in prison or slave labor 
camp then maybe I can do a little something But nothing is 
getting done Nothing changes said Ms Hallik 
The dissidents are seeking permission for a demonstration in the 
center of Tallinn capital of Estonia on Feb 24 They have not 
yet heard from officials but say they have the support of average 
Estonians 
If they try to isolate every one of the group the people 
will come out because they will have heard something is 
happening she said 
On Thursday Ms Halliks 55yearold mother Klara was among 
writers scholars and officials from the Baltic republics taking 
part in a panel discussion of national problems organized for 
foreign reporters by the government news agency Novosti 
Klara Hallik discounted the importance of nationalism as a 
problem in Estonia and she and other panel members drew a 
distinction between nationalism and cultural differences 
Her daughter said she respects her mothers views but that they 
sharply disagree Superiors at work and the KGB have put pressure 
on her parents because of their daughters views Ms Hallik said 
Little open conflict is evident between ethnic groups in 
Estonia Writer Ulo Tuulik a member of the officially sponsored 
panel said Estonians and other ethnic groups could be compared 
to the Mississippi and Volga rivers We just live our own lives and 
dont have great conflicts 
Estonians number just more than 1 million and make up 61 percent 
of their small republic but that figure has dropped from almost 75 
percent in 1959 Russians now make up 28 percent of the population 
According to 1987 official statistics only 25 percent of the 
Estonians spoke fluent Russian the dominant language of the Soviet 
Union One out of 10 nonEstonians could speak fluent Estonian 
In Latvia in 1979 there were about 13 million Latvians and 
821000 Russians but Lithuanians made up 80 percent of the 
population of their republic 
The official group blamed nationalist protests on a small group 
of extremists 
Toomas Karjaharm a professor of history at Tallinn State 
Conservatory said the protests are tied to social and economic 
problems which have gotten worse in the past few years and which 
officials are trying to solve under Mikhail S Gorbachevs reform 
policies 
Officials say the number of Estonians in the republic is 
dropping because Estonians have one of the lowest birth rates in 
the Soviet Union and that many of the nonEstonians who move there 
are young people attracted by good jobs in the republics 
industries 
But one Estonian dissident speaking on condition of anonymity 
dismissed Gorbachev as a loud voice of an empty barrel rolling 
along 
To limit the migration officials are requiring staterun 
industries that seek workers outside the republic to put up about 
25000 for each workers housing A similar program is in effect 
in Latvia 
Officials also are trying to publish more books in the native 
languages of the Baltic republics and are encouraging people of 
nonBaltic origin to learn the languages of the indigenous 
nationalities 
The official media also accuse Western radio stations of 
stirring up nationalist feelings in the Baltics 
Most of the protests in the Baltic republics have been peaceful 
but the dissidents report more surveillance and pressure 
Dissident sources say activists in Lithuania and Estonia have 
been arrested for refusing temporary military service They charge 
that the temporary callup in both cases was an attempt by 
authorities to discourage protests 
The official Lithuanian press has warned that activists face 
prosecution if they disrupt public order and Soviet President 
Andrei A Gromyko addressed the issue in a visit to Vilnius 
Lithuania a week ago 
Two members of a group trying to establish an alternative to the 
Communist Party in Estonia Vello Vaartnou and EkePart Nomm said 
they were forced to emigrate Saturday to Sweden 
The Baltic Helsinki Group a human rights group based in 
Stockholm Sweden quoted Nomm as saying he and Vaartnou had been 
told by Soviet authorities to leave the country or face 
imprisonment
