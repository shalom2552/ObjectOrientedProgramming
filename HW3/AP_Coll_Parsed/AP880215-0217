Katrine Hvitved a 16yearold high 
school student wrote an irate letter to a newspaper complaining 
that Danish air force discriminates against women and keeps her 
from fulfilling her dream of flying an F16 jetfighter 
But the air force has told her maybe not 
I would like to be a pilot but cant be one in the 
military she wrote to the newspaper JyllandsPosten Its 
unjust 
Two weeks later Defense Minister Bernt Collet replied to 
Katrine in a letter to the same newspaper saying an air force 
policy of keeping women from piloting military planes is under 
review and likely to change 
Women are accepted in Denmarks armed forces but they cannot fly 
planes 
Katrine who specializes in science and mathematics at school 
said by telephone from her home in the port city of Aalborg she was 
delighted with Collets response 
Ive been crazy about jet planes for years and enjoy visiting 
air force bases 
But she added that she still has a problem 
My parents would rather I stayed on the ground 
Nevertheless shes decided to join a parachutists club 
Last year the military began a study women pilots Based mainly 
on the experiences of other NATO countries the report is expected 
to be submitted to a parliamentary committee for action later this 
year 
The military chiefs seem to be very positive towards the 
proposal said Maj Benny Hansen of the air force the Defense 
Ministry official who deals with personnel 
A decision to allow women into flight training would be in 
keeping with military policy laid down in 1980 of equal rights in 
all branches of the armed forces Hansen added 
Experiments since 1980 placing women in combat units have proven 
successful Hansen said 
The military hasnt noticed any weakening of fighting strength 
in combat units with women in them 
A total of 844 women including 58 officers were serving in all 
armed forces branches as of June last year the date of the latest 
available statistics They were in field units in the infantry the 
tank corps surfacetoair missile squadrons and base patrol duties 
The navy has five women officers and 99 sailors They serve on 
inspection vessels corvettes and torpedo boats But they arent on 
submarines where quarters are too close 
Hansen said he sees no problems for women as helicopter or 
transport plane pilots But experts are still concerned about how 
women would stand up to the extreme gravitational forces 
experienced by pilots of supersonic jets 
Gstress and speed and precision of reaction were problems for 
male fighter pilots too Hansen said 
In Denmark aspiring combat pilots go to a twoyear civilian 
flight school supervised by the military before being sent to 
United States for advanced training 
Female pilot trainees will face the same physical and 
psychological demands that men do and there will be no lowering of 
standards to get women in Hansen said 
Nor would a womans maritial status or the fact she had children 
be taken into account he added 
Hansen pointed out that in neighboring Norway where women 
already train as military pilots only two out of 300 candidates 
have earned wings 
The Netherlands Canada and United States also have trained 
women pilots for their air forces
