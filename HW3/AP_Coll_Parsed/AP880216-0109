A woman whose soldier husband was killed in 
the Tet offensive 20 years ago this month said she has learned the 
Army misplaced his body for two weeks at a time when she was told 
he was missing in action 
Brenda Reed Sutton who has been researching a book looking at 
the Vietnam War from a widows viewpoint expressed outrage and 
disbelief this week at her latest information from a chaplain in 
her husbands unit 
If theyd told me the truth my family and I would have been 
able to put this to bed a long time ago she said 
She said she wasnt told her husband had been killed until two 
weeks after the Army told her he was missing in action She 
continued to write him letters sometimes as often as three times a 
day during that period 
It was a month before his body was returned home she was never 
allowed to see the body she said 
The latest information came from Paul Hinsky the chaplain with 
Capt James Eddie Reeds company in the Mekong Delta After 
reading a Feb 1 Associated Press story about Suttons efforts to 
finally learn the hazy circumstances behind her husbands death 
Hinsky and several of Reeds soldiers got in touch with her 
Hinsky who now lives in Plainville Mass said he was the 
first person to reach her husband after the attack atop an old 
French stronghold called Fort Courage 20 miles south of the 
former capital of South Vietnam 
The chaplain assured her that he Reed never knew what hit 
him and confirmed what she had heard last summer from several 
enlisted men A young American soldier who believed his short 
mortar round killed Reed and three other officers went berserk that 
night and had to be shipped out 
Hearing from the chaplain Sutton says was quite a touching 
moment Id always wondered who was the first person there Then 20 
years to the day later I hear from this warm and caring chaplain 
who tells me Eddie was a tremendous person and says Your husband 
never suffered 
He also told Sutton she said that The Army screwed up They 
lost his body 
I cant imagine how they could have misplaced his body and 
then delayed telling her he was dead she said 
She continues to be stymied she said in her efforts to secure 
a copy of a reported full investigation into the fatal events of 20 
years ago 
Although Sutton said shes still angry over the Armys handling 
of the case she said shes happy at having achieved so much in her 
attempt to reconcile herself to the death of her husband her high 
school sweetheart in Kingsport Tenn 
One soldier she said told her this month that Eddie was the 
best officer in Vietnam 
It warms my heart to know how much the men cared about him 
she said Now I know that they felt pain at losing him too 
Her two children including a 23yearold son who joined her on 
an emotional trip back to Vietnam last fall are thrilled with 
the news that their father was mourned by his soldiers she said 
Several publishers Sutton said have expressed interest in her 
manuscript tentatively titled Silent Partner A Vietnam Widows
