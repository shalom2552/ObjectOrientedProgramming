Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis 
rejoicing that we went for the gold and won it in New 
Hampshires presidential primary sought today to parlay that 
glitter into solid Southern support 
People in the South arent voting for a ZIP code theyre 
voting for the president The next president of the United 
States has got to be somebody who can bring this country 
together he said on ABCTVs Good Morning America 
While polls show him in the middle of the pack in the South 
where most states hold primaries or caucuses on March 8 Dukakis 
hopes what worked in nextdoor New Hampshire will play in Dixie as 
well 
Dukakis was flying today to Atlanta and Tampa for rallies 
I had to prove to them that I was a viable candidate for the 
presidency Dukakis said The South is very much a part of this 
country The goals dreams the values of the South are very much 
the same as the northeast 
Dukakis scored a convincing win over Missouri Rep Richard 
Gephardt who in turn edged Sen Paul Simon of Illinois who has 
financial worries Dukakis said I would think its going to be 
difficult for Simon to continue in the race 
But the Massachusetts governor faces strong Southern competition 
from two Democrats who finished behind the frontrunners in New 
Hampshire Jesse Jackson and Tennessee Sen Albert Gore Gephardt 
is also expected to do well in the South 
Dukakis was looking ahead to the Southern battle even as he made 
his victory speech in New Hampshire 
Some people have been asking how a New Englander can hope to 
do well on Super Tuesday Dukakis said They want to know what 
my Southern strategy is The fact of the matter is I dont have 
a southern strategy I dont have a northern strategy or a western 
strategy I have an American strategy 
I believe in the kind of politics where you say the same 
thing wherever you go in our country A campaign that unites 
America and doesnt divide it The people of Texas and Florida 
arent asking where candidates are from Theyre asking where 
theyll take us 
Overall the speech focused on principles and general ideas for 
the most part and stayed clear of specifics and political details 
Thank you the people of New Hampshire for starting us off on 
the road to the White House Dukakis told a gathering of about 
1000 supporters in Manchester 
Dukakis consultant Michael Goldman said the governor plans to 
spend nearly 4 million in the South Gore for his part has 
launched a 1 million media campaign 
Dukakis was confident enough about Tuesdays outcome to talk 
about his plans for Super Tuesday before the polls closed The 
March 8 presidential extravaganza involves primaries and caucuses 
in 20 states including 14 southern and border states 
Were going to contest every one of those states Dukakis 
said I think were going to surprise some people in the South
