President Oscar Arias main author 
of a Central American peace plan urged Moscow Thursday to halt 
arms shipments to insurgents in the region He said Mikhail S 
Gorbachevs new image would be tested now 
Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting the peace 
accord signed last August by himself and the presidents of El 
Salvador Nicaragua Guatemala and Honduras 
He said in a message broadcast nationwide on radio and 
television We must struggle with the help of the whole world 
so that the shipment of arms to insurgents in the region stops 
Then he directed the call specifically at the Soviet Union He 
said the image being fostered by Soviet leader Gorbachev less 
dogmatic and relatively tolerant would be put to the test in 
Central America 
He Gorbachev should cease all armed support direct or 
indirect by means of Cuba and Nicaragua to insurgent forces 
Leftist guerrillas in El Salvador have been waging an 8yearold 
guerrilla war against the USbacked government there The 
guerrillas reportedly receive some of their weapons from East bloc 
supporters who channel the arms through Cuba and Nicaragua 
The guerrillas deny the reports of outside military aid They 
say their arms are purchased on the international black market or 
captured from government forces 
Today there is a chance for peace like never before in Central 
America said Arias an opportunity for democracy in Latin 
America like never before There is a last chance to defeat poverty 
and to prevent misery protected by dictatorships from 
perpetuating itself 
He expressed the hope that Nicaragua will move resolutely toward 
making its society more democratic and that peace talks between 
combatants in both Nicaragua and El Salvador will resume and bear 
fruit 
It is they who must choose between war and peace he said 
Ceasefire negotiations between USbacked Contra rebels and 
representatives of Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista government are to 
resume next week in Guatemala 
Peace talks between the two sides in El Salvador have stalled 
The government says they will not be resumed until after 
legislative and municipal elections March 20 
The Arias accord demands ceasefires in Nicaragua El Salvador 
and Guatemala greater freedom and democracy throughout Central 
America an end to outside aid to insurgent forces in the region 
and a halt to the use of any countrys territory as a base for 
attacks on another nation
