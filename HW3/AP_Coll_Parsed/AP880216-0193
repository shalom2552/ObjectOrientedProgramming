Linda Kelsey with two toddlers of her own 
feels at home when shes working on the set of her new NBC comedy 
series Day by Day 
In the new series getting a tryout on NBC Kelsey and onscreen 
husband Doug Sheehan give up their jobs to stay home and run a 
daycare center 
She was a lawyer and he was a stockbroker and they feel a need 
to devote more time to their new baby than they did to their 
teenage son One of the shows creators is Gary David Goldberg 
Family Ties 
Gary said I was in his mind from the beginning said Kelsey 
I knew him because he produced Lou Grant I didnt know 
however if I was the only candidate or one of many He wondered 
why I was so tentative I told him Gary I dont know how many 
people youre seeing but Id really love to be in it He said 
You are it Theres no one else 
Gary says its the story of his own life Hes wanted to do 
this for several years When he was a struggling writer in Berkeley 
he and Diane Meehan had their first child They ran a day care 
center at home Its a situation filled with such comedy 
Goldberg was also responsible for getting a childcare center 
built at Paramount Studios where the show is filmed Kelsey 
frequently brings her two children Sophia Nellist 4 and Margit 
Isabella 8 months 
NBC is going all out to launch Day by Day It will be 
telecast this Monday and Thursday then begin its regular schedule 
on Sunday March 6 replacing My Two Dads which will 
temporarily become a roving designated hitter on the NBC 
schedule 
Sophie sometimes plays on the set with the kids before we 
start work Kelsey said When its time to start filming up 
goes her hand and she says Im not in this Which makes me very 
happy At home she can work her fathers computer and is teaching 
herself to read 
She and her husband Glenn Strand a computer systems analyst 
live in Ojai 70 miles northwest of Los Angeles She commutes by 
limousine I take a little nap in the car and when I get home Im 
refreshed she said 
Kelsey starred for five years as reporter Billie Newman in Lou 
Grant and after that was in the TV movie Baby Girl Scott and 
the miniseries Nutcracker Money Murder and Madness 
I havent done a lot since Lou Grant but it was by choice 
because I had two children she said Then six months ago I did 
a play and it whetted my appetite to get back to work 
She says it was her frequent appearance on The Mary Tyler 
Moore Show that led to her casting in Lou Grant 
Being a guest star I thought was the easiest thing in the 
world she said I could do some shoppingrun errands In a 
series Im there all the time When I was a guest star I didnt 
realize that Mary was in almost every scene 
One show was based on All About Eve she said I come in 
all innocent and take over Sue Ann Nivens job I was Eve 
Harrington to her Margo Channing Betty White was nominated for an 
Emmy for that show 
She was a guest on such shows as Doc MASH and The 
Rockford Files and most of producer Quinn Martins shows such 
as Streets of San Francisco and Barnaby Jones 
Those were great shows for the actors she said You could 
get in Quinn Martins repertory company and do his shows Those 
were great parts You were the murderer I thought then Id never 
do a series All of the good parts went to the guest stars Things 
have changed so much now Look at LA Law with its wonderful 
parts for the regulars 
Day by Day has 12 children five of whom have speaking roles 
They saw 600 children she said and interviewed them 
apart from their parents The two key questions were Do you want 
to do this and Do you want to do this many different ways We 
wanted kids who wanted to do it not those whose parents were 
pushing them We got kids who want to be here 
Kelsey relaxes by weaving knitting spinning and doing 
needlework 
I dont have much time right now she said But its so 
relaxing It shuts out the world I weave a lot of fabrics but I 
cant bear to part with them I think if I make them into 
childrens clothes theyll get dirty
