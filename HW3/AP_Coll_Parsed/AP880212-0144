Canadas merchandise trade surplus shrank to 208 
million Canadian dollars in December or about 164 million the 
lowest monthly surplus since September 1981 Statistics Canada said 
Friday 
The December surplus down from a revised 402 million Canadian 
dollars in November left the full years surplus at the lowest 
level in seven years 
The 1987 surplus totaled 103 billion Canadian dollars or about 
81 billion down marginally from 104 billion Canadian dollars in 
1986 the agency said 
The surplus with the United States Canadas most important 
trading partner declined to 17 billion Canadian dollars from 184 
billion Canadian dollars in 1986 Those numbers are reconciled with 
the United States 
Paul Kovacs senior economist at the Burns Fry investment house 
in Toronto said he had expected 1987 would have ended with a much 
stronger trade surplus the result of Canada exporting more goods 
than it imported 
We clearly had a deteriorating trend at the end of the year 
which is disturbing said Kovacs 
Exports grew by 41 per cent in 1987 from the previous year 
rising to 1258 billion Canadian dollars largely on strong foreign 
sales of forest products 
However imports increased at the slightly quicker pace of 47 
per cent during the year to reach 1154 billion Canadian dollars by 
year end 
Meanwhile the trade deficit with Japan the No 2 trading 
partner fell to 691 million Canadian dollars from more than 16 
billion Canadian dollars the year before 
Statistics Canada said the rise in exports was mainly the result 
of an increase of 32 billion Canadian dollars in forestproduct 
sales that came despite export taxes Canada was forced to impose on 
softwood lumber because of American action 
However foreign sales of automotive products from Canada fell 
by 22 billion Canadian dollars to 32 billion Canadian dollars 
Merchandise trade is only about half of Canadas total trade 
picture with the rest coming in service sectors such as tourism 
shipping and consulting
