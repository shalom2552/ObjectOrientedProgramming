A defense attorney in the Nazi war crimes trial 
of John Demjanjuk said in closing arguments Tuesday his clients 
alibi was sound and that contradictions in his testimony were due 
to memory lapses and pressure from investigators 
Demjanjuk is confused about all of his movements not only 
about details of what he did during World War II defense attorney 
Yoram Sheftel said Tuesday the first anniversary of the trial 
Demjanjuk 67 a retired Ohio autoworker is accused of being 
Ivan the Terrible a sadistic guard who operated gas chambers 
that killed 850000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in 
Nazioccupied Poland in 1942 and 1943 
The Ukrainianborn Demjanjuk claims that hes a victim of 
mistaken identity He has said he served in the Soviet army was 
captured by the Germans in 1941 and remained in prisonerofwar 
camps until 1943 
Sheftel rejected prosecution charges that Demjanjuk invented an 
alibi If Demjanjuks testimony was contradictory in parts it 
should be attributed to memory lapses Sheftel said noting that 
his client could also not remember simple facts about his family 
The accused forgot Sheftel said If he made up an alibi 
he would not forget it If someone concocts an alibi you work it 
out think it out maybe write it out Its very easy to do 
Sheftel also claimed his client could not be expected to 
remember all events coherently because investigators pressured and 
intimidated him He said police told Demjanjuk before the trial 
they would put a rope around his head 
Sheftel also said Israeli police deployed a Ukrainianspeaking 
guard to befriend Demjanjuk and elicit incriminating information 
but the effort backfired because Demjanjuk stuck to his version of 
the events 
Sheftel said the few details Demjanjuk has provided about his 
whereabouts in World War II mesh with testimony of historians 
called by the prosecution He also said Demjanjuk couldnt have 
known the facts unless he had personally experienced them 
In one instance Demjanjuk told the court he was laying railroad 
tracks after becoming a German prisoner of war Sheftel said 
The attorney cited testimony by a prosecution witness who said 
the German high command at the time gave high priority to repairing 
railway tracks damaged in the Crimea battle 
Sheftel acknowledged that Demjanjuk lied in filling out a 1948 
application for immigration to the United States by stating he was 
a Polish farmer 
Sheftel said Demjanjuk lied because he didnt want to be 
returned to the Soviet Union for fear he would be executed after 
serving in an antiCommunist unit at the end of the war 
The defense is to complete closing arguments this week The 
threejudge panel is expected to render a verdict in April If 
convicted Demjanjuk faces a death sentence
