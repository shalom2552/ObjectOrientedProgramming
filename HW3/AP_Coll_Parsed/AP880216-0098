A West German who was critically injured when a 
boulder hit a tour bus needs rehabilitation treatment but the 
state may not pay for it and his family cant afford it 
Markus Lang is ready to leave Denver General Hospital where he 
has been for the past six months but no rehabilitation center in 
Colorado or West Germany will accept him without assurances that 
someone can pay the bills 
Lang was the most severely hurt of the 15 people who were 
injured when the 7ton boulder hit the Gray Line Tour bus on US 
40 last Aug 10 Eight people were killed in the accident 
After seven brain operations and seven operations on his crushed 
limbs Langs right leg and left arm remain in casts Vision in his 
remaining eye is impaired 
The boulder was accidentally dislodged by a Colorado Highway 
Department crew Last month the state attorney generals office 
sought a court order upholding the states 400000 total liability 
limit for the accident as well as the states immunity to lawsuits 
The request is pending 
Despite Gov Roy Romers vow that Colorado would take 
responsibility there are no assurances the state will pay for 
Langs extended rehabilitation 
Langs parents are in their 60s and cannot afford to pay for the 
treatment said his mother Rita who flew to Denver from her home 
in Benninger West Germany She spends every day reading and 
talking to Lang 
Lang 24 speaks in simple English to the nurses but answers 
his mothers questions in German He has begun feeding himself and 
can sit up 
Denver General Hospital has no longterm rehabilitation program 
and plans to discharge Lang within a few weeks 
The hospital also has filed a collection notice against the 
state for more than 350000 in unpaid hospital bills for Langs 
treatment
