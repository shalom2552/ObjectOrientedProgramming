Alexander M Haig Jr ended his quixotic 
quest for the presidency Friday endorsing Kansas Sen Bob Dole and 
attacking Vice President George Bush as no more than a spectator in 
Reagan administration councils 
Asked his opinion of Bushs involvement in important 
decisionmaking the former secretary of state said Bush had merely 
been there period 
More than 200 reporters and at least 30 television cameras were 
in the room for Haigs announcement by far the most coverage he 
received at any time in his yearlong campaign He withdrew from 
the race for the Republican presidential nomination at a news 
conference on a day when a snowstorm played havoc with the 
schedules of the remaining candidates 
He opened by saying his assessment of the race had made it clear 
that Al Haig will not be the 1988 Republican nominee 
Haig received less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa 
precinct caucuses on Monday and was receiving only about 1 percent 
support in polls of Republican voters in New Hampshire 
He endorsed Dole as the candidate who embodies best my 
understanding of the crucial challenges we face 
Dole appeared briefly at Haigs side to say the endorsement 
means a great deal to me personally and that the former NATO 
commander had told him he wanted no role in a Dole administration 
While free with his praise of Dole Haig seemed to relish even 
more his attacks on Bush 
What have you got against George Bush Haig was asked 
Not a single thing in terms of George Bush he replied 
Hes a friend Ive known him for 20 years 
But he went on to say that he had worked with both men for two 
decades and from my point of view Bob Dole is head and shoulders 
above George Bush as a potential president 
Most important of all he said Dole exceeds Bush in the 
demeanor the internal strength the ability to deal eyeball to 
eyeball with those who do not share our values around the world 
Bush later phoned WKNE in Keene to boast that he won the 
immediate endorsement of state Rep Edward Bennett of Bridgewater 
one of Haigs three state cochairman 
Then on Manchester television Bush said Bennett thinks that 
Im head and shoulders above Bob Dole 
Haigs greatest contribution to the Dole campaign may well have 
come earlier during televised debates when he pressed Bush on his 
role in the IranContra affair and asked him if he had been in 
the cockpit or on an economy ride in the back of the plane as 
vice president 
When asked Friday about reports of Bush involvement with 
Panamanian strongman Gen Manuel Antonio Noriega Haig said I do 
think theres been less than forthright discussion of this issue by 
the vice president 
Haig withdrew four days before the New Hampshire primary and 
when asked about the timing he replied in a sentence typical of 
what had become known during his public career as Haigspeak 
It takes a bit of arrogance to be so egoinvolved in a 
campaign such as this that you want to take the few percentage 
points that could be critical to another candidate to the political 
graveyard 
Im not that way I want to make a difference 
As a candidate the 63yearold retired general who had 
announced last year he was throwing my helmet into the ring was 
often openly critical of Reagan administration domestic and foreign 
policies 
Speaking with the authority of having been Reagans first 
secretary of state Haig has criticized the presidents approach in 
the Persian Gulf and also has opposed the INF treaty to eliminate 
mediumrange missiles from Europe 
On domestic issues he has said the record federal budget 
deficits of the Reagan years stemmed in part from the policies 
pursued by the administration making him the only candidate other 
than Dole to lay some of the blame somewhere other than on Congress 
In campaign appearances Haig was fond of saying he had served 
under seven presidents and recalling his strong role as chief of 
staff in the White House during the final months of Richard M 
Nixons presidency 
At a Republican dinner in Nashua Wednesday night he quipped 
Im the only one of the GOP candidates whos been president 
before and I liked it
