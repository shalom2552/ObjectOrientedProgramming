All eyes turn toward Texas this week as Democratic 
and Republican presidential candidates converge on Dallas for the 
first major event of the Super Tuesday campaign the Texas debates 
The 12 candidates who survived the New Hampshire primary have 
set their sights on the 20 states holding primaries on Super 
Tuesday March 8 focusing much of their attention on Texas which 
leads the states with 183 Democratic and 111 Republican delegates 
Texas is the crown jewel in this because we are the largest 
said state Democratic Party Chairman Bob Slagle 
The debates which will be aired nationally on the Public 
Broadcasting System from Southern Methodist University begin 
Thursday at 9 pm EST with the Democratic candidates The GOP 
hopefuls debate the following night 
Sen Albert Gore Jr a Tennessee Democrat who calls Southern 
states key to a presidential win and Vice President George Bush a 
Republican candidate who maintains a Houston address say they 
welcome the chance to debate in Dallas 
Topics likely to take center stage in the debates include 
economic issues in the Southwest including unemployment and the 
energy industry 
Bush a former congressman from Houston who still claims it as 
his home is all too familiar with Texas issues such as energy 
immigration policy and the business climate said Kevin Moomaw his 
Texas political director in Austin 
Certainly with a 40year association in this state and with 
George Jr from Midland he understands whats going on down 
here Moomaw said 
Presidential candidates with Southern ties may have the edge in 
the debates which come only two days after the New Hampshire 
primary in which Bush won the Republican race and Massachusetts 
Gov Michael Dukakis outdistanced the Democratic field 
Gore a Democrat deemphasized the New Hampshire primary and 
Iowa caucuses in his strategy concentrating his efforts on the 
South 
With 20 states and about 40 percent of the delegates chosen on 
that day it made sense to focus his efforts down here said Tom 
Jurkovich Texas coordinator for the Gore campaign in Austin 
Being from the region gives him an understanding of the people 
and concerns That gives him a certain edge 
Gore was dead last in Iowa after pulling his campaign out of 
that state last year 
This is our chance to counter Iowa and New Hampshire and say 
those two states are too big for their britches and their britches 
are not all that big at that Slagle said 
The debates are sponsored by The Dallas Morning News KERATV 
and Texas Monthly magazine Roger Mudd a special correspondent on 
The MacNeilLehrer News Hour and former coanchor of NBC 
Nightly News will moderate 
All the candidates are expected to take part in the debate 
Besides those issues whats important is how these guys come 
across and it may be that many Texans will now start focusing on 
the presidential race Slagle said Texans have said they want 
to be able to have a say early on who the next president is
