The diskshaped Milky Way galaxy is not flat but 
resembles instead a warped phonograph record and is adorned with a 
delicate scalloped edge new observations show 
The scalloping is something we dont understand Leo Blitz 
an astronomer at the University of Maryland said Saturday 
Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science Blitz said Our picture of the galaxy 
has changed significantly in the last five to 10 years 
The Milky Way once considered merely a typical example of a 
spiral galaxy is now thought to be a much more exciting and 
interesting aggregation Among the recent findings reported 
Saturday were 
Ninety percent of the galaxy is invisible and nobody knows 
what this huge dark halo is made of 
The galaxy is powered by two compact objects at its center 
that might be the remnants of starburst formation or that could be 
associated with a black hole 
The galaxys dark halo could be full of remnants of the big 
bang called weakly interactive massive particles or WIMPs 
The galaxy consists of a slim starstudded disk about 100000 
lightyears across Blitz said A light year is about 6 trillion 
miles 
Surrounding that visible disk is a cloud of hydrogen gas 
extending another 25000 lightyears 
It is at the edge of that gaseous disk that radio astronomers 
have found warping and scalloping Blitz said 
Beyond that lies 90 percent of the mass of the galaxy It is 
invisible and astronomers dont know what it is said Martin Rees 
of Cambridge University 
It could be made of a trillion very small faint stars each 
onetenth the size of the sun Another possibility is that it is 
composed of black holes the remnants of massive stars 
Or it could be made of WIMPs an explanation that Rees said is 
more radical than the others 
What we want to do is narrow down the possibilities Rees 
said What we see is a trace of sediment in a universe where 
galaxies in a cosmic sea are dominated by this missing matter 
The galaxys oddities are not limited to its outer edges 
however The inner 10 percent of our galaxy seems to be unique 
said Leonid Ozernoy of the HarvardSmithsonian Center for 
Astrophysics in Cambridge Mass The star density is huge there 
It is also a powerful source of radiation emitting infrared 
Xrays and gamma rays Ozernoy said 
A black hole could lie at the center of the galaxy driving its 
rotation Such a black hole could be the remnant of starburst 
formation Ozernoy said 
Observations yet to be made could resolve some of the puzzles 
that remain Rees said 
It might be possible he said to use gravitational lenses 
areas in space in which gravity bends light in the same way that a 
magnifying glass does to see small faint stars in the dark halo 
if they exist 
Experiments are being planned in the United States and Europe to 
try to identify the WIMPs if they exist Rees said 
The problem of missing mass is one that extends across the 
entire universe not only in the Milky Way Rees said and the 
discovery of new particles in this invisible matter would have a 
payoff so colossal that the modest investment in such experiments 
seems more than justified Rees said in his prepared remarks
