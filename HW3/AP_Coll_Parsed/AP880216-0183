Massachusetts Gov Michael S Dukakis 
celebrated a resounding victory in New Hampshires Democratic 
primary Tuesday night declaring that the best America is yet to 
come 
Last week in Iowa our message started to shine through and we 
won a bronze he told more than 1000 cheering supporters 
gathered at a restored mill building Tonight here in New 
Hampshire our message came through loud and clear We went for the 
gold and we won it 
With just under 90 percent of the precincts counted Dukakis had 
about 36 percent of the vote Rep Richard Gephardt and Sen Paul 
Simon who grabbed the first two spots in the Iowa caucuses were 
battling it out for second 
Dukakis who will take his campaign South on Wednesday sought 
to put to rest questions about his strategy for the region 
The fact of the matter is I dont have a Southern strategy 
he said I dont have a Northern strategy or a Western strategy 
I have an American strategy 
He said We believe in the kind of politics where you say the 
same thing wherever you go in this country The people of 
Arkansas and Kentucky are not voting for a zip code theyre voting 
for a president of the United States 
As a Northeastern liberal Dukakis faces his stiffest test in 
the Southern states But as the Democrat with the biggest campaign 
warchest Dukakis has been able to send a plethora of staff to the 
region 
He is working particularly hard in Florida with its Jewish 
population Dukakis wife Kitty is Jewish in Atlanta viewed as 
the capital of the South and in Texas where he is seeking the 
Hispanic vote
