Thirtytwo Senators have written to Kremlin 
leader Mikhail S Gorbachev asking him not to interfere with 
demonstrations and religious services scheduled this Sunday and 
Tuesday in the Soviet republics of Lithuania and Estonia it was 
announced Friday 
The senators wrote Gorbachev to urge you not only to allow the 
Lithuanian and Estonian people to peacefully honor their national 
independence days but also to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that they do not become targets of statesponsored 
harassment before or after these commemorations 
The statecontrolled Soviet news media has criticized similar 
congressional statements in the past for inciting public 
demonstrations in the Baltic republics 
The latest congressional letter cosponsored by Sens Donald 
Riegle DMich David Durenberger RMinn and Frank Lautenberg 
DNJ praised Gorbachev for not interfering with demonstrations 
by an estimated 10000 people in the three Baltic republics last 
Aug 23 
Those demonstrations marked the anniversary of the 1939 
MolotovRibbentrop pact under which Stalin agreed to allow Hitler 
to invade western Poland and Hitler allowed Stalin to invade 
eastern Poland Lithuania Latvia and Estonia 
For years the citizens of Estonia and Lithuania have 
celebrated within the privacy of their homes their preSoviet 
independence days in February 
The public demonstrations in the Baltic republics last August 
came in response to Gorbachevs policies of greater openness and 
brought warnings from two conservative members of the ruling 
Politburo Viktor Chebrikov chairman of the KGB security police 
and Yegor Ligachev the Communist Partys chief ideologist that 
things were getting out of hand 
The US senators wrote Gorbachev that they had received reports 
from emigre groups that 200 Lithuanians have written a letter 
informing you of their intention to commemorate their independence 
day on Feb 16 with flowerlaying ceremonies 
Religious services also have been scheduled Sunday to mark the 
preSoviet national day in Lithuania which remains overwhelmingly 
Roman Catholic after nearly 50 years of rule by the officially 
atheistic Kremlin authorities 
The senators said one report reaching the West indicates that 
Soviet authorities may move to block these peaceful ceremonies 
They cited a report of the beating in Vilnius on Feb 6 of Nijole 
Sadunaite a leading Lithuanian dissident in an apparent attempt 
to intimidate her 
The Lithuanian Information Center an emigre organization with 
offices in Washington and New York blamed the beating on 
plainclothes KGB officers 
The letter cited concern over official harassment and abuse 
against demonstrators and cited as an ominous warning a report in 
the Communist Party daily Pravda on Jan 29 that Lithuanian 
authorities had decided to intensify their efforts against 
bourgeois nationalsim and clerical extremism

Durenberger were Brock Adams DWash Rudy Boschwitz RMinn
