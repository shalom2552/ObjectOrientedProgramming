Chinas controversial family planning policies 
have failed for the second straight year The growing willingness 
of couples to defy the onechild limit threatens to send the 
population zooming out of control 
China has estimated that to hold its population within the 
planned limit of 12 billion in 2000 and 15 billion in 2050 it 
must keep the birth rate below 15 percent 
But the birth rate hit 2 percent in 1986 and stayed there in 
1987 If that pace is maintained Chinas 1 billion people will 
become 2 billion by 2030 according to a recent estimate by the 
UN Fund for Population Activities 
In a recent frontpage commentary the official Peoples Daily 
declared the family planning situation was out of control in 
some provinces 
One false move may lose the game it said Chinas 
continuously growing population is in fact facing a crisis 
The surge is fueled largely by newly prosperous peasants who 
have enough money to pay government fines for breaking the 
onechild limit and incentives under the new economic reforms to do 
so 
Since the breakup of communes in the early 1980s families have 
been responsible for farming their own plots of land More children 
to help plant and harvest means more profit 
Even urban residents who surveys indicate are less eager than 
peasants to have large families envy the ease with which newly 
rich peasants have been able to buy extra children 
Fines vary from region to region but generally amount to about 
270 per year for five years The amount isnt prohibitive if 
several family members chip in 
The average rural income is about 270 per couple but annual 
family incomes of several times that amount are increasingly common 
City residents face not only fines but suspension from work for 
one or two years for having a second child 
Officials responded to the high 1986 birth rate with calls for 
better birth control education But when the 1987 figures came out 
the family planning minister Wang Wei was sacked 
The government also announced measures to tighten local 
enforcement of the onechild limit by linking it to officials 
paychecks 
At an urgent meeting of family planning officials early this 
year acting Premier Li Peng ordered that officials be rewarded or 
punished based on how well they enforce the onechild policy 
But Chinese authorities sensitive about past US congressional 
charges of coerced abortions said at a recent news conference that 
officials will not be rewarded for high numbers of abortions in 
their jurisdictions 
Efforts are to be made to raise the use of birth control and 
contraceptive methods and reduce the number of abortions said 
Liang Jimin director of the Family Planning Commissions general 
office 
He insisted that only education and persuasion would be used 
to encourage abortions when families already have a child 
In an apparent reflection of the new tough attitude medical 
workers in Beijing said hospitals recently have begun refusing 
admission to women about to give birth to a second or third child 
Family planning authorities also have gotten tougher on migrant 
worker families who have taken advantage of their roving status to 
flout the onechild limit 
The official Xinhua News Agency said some migrant couples have 
as many as five or six children 
In the northeastern city of Shenyang officials ruled in January 
that employers must issue planned birth cards to all migrant 
workers so their family sizes can be recorded and monitored 
Family planning education programs have been stepped up Almost 
the only propaganda posters still seen in China are those touting 
the onechild policy 
China Central Television mindful that half of all Chinese homes 
have televisions broadcast weekly programs on family planning last 
year 
But a combination of demographics and superstition make it 
likely births will increase rather than drop in 1988 
The population of childbearing women increased by 7 million in 
1987 and will grow by 8 million this year to 297 million as the 
products of Chinas baby boom of the 1960s reach maturity 
Furthermore 1988 is the year of the dragon in Chinas 
traditional 12year astrological cycle The dragon is a symbol of 
good luck and power and many young couples are expected to try to 
have their one child this year 
The official Workers Daily recently tried to debunk traditional 
beliefs about lucky dragon babies If birth control limits are 
ignored it warned the dragon year will not be lucky for an 
overpopulated nation
