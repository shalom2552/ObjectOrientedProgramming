Ten more people have been 
killed in black facitional violence in Natal province including an 
elderly couple who were stabbed to death police reported Monday 
Six of the deaths reported overnight occurred in black townships 
near Pietermaritzburg Among them were a 70yearold man and his 
wife 60 and 61yearold woman all stabbed 
More than 400 people have been killed in the Pietermaritzburg 
area since early 1987 in a power struggle between two black 
organizations 
Four blacks were killed in KwaDengezi a township near the port 
city of Durban the police reported Monday They said attackers 
hurled a firebomb at a house then fired at occupants who fled 
Most of the Natal violence stems from a feud between the United 
Democratic Front South Africas largest antiapartheid coalition 
and Inkatha the more conservative organization of Zulu leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
Buthelezi chief minister of the KwaZulu black homeland opposes 
apartheid but condemns the coalitions advocacy of boycotts and 
other militant strategies Front leaders consider Buthelezi too 
cooperative with white authorities 
On Sunday Buthelezi released the text of a letter to Archie 
Gumede copresident of the United Democratic Front In it he 
proposed peace talks and blamed both sides for letting the violence 
continue 
Men women and children are being butchered he wrote 
Apartheid continues to kick us in the guts And yet we are 
pathetically shouting at each other from public platforms It 
shames me it shames us both 
Do you and the UDF want a measure of sanity to prevail You 
and I know that for this to happen we will have to reach some sort 
of accord
