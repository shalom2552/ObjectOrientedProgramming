More than President Hosni Mubaraks efforts 
to bring peace to the Middle East Egyptians are talking these days 
about shortages of cooking oil and sugar Its angry talk 
Cooking oil and sugar are important items on the Egyptian menu 
used extensively by peasants who make up half the nations 51 
million people 
Cooking oil is added to beans which are eaten at breakfast and 
dinner and used to fry vegetables especially eggplant and 
potatoes the usual peasant lunch 
As for sugar Egyptians consume so much in tea pastries and 
candy that the Health Ministry has begun a television campaign in 
an effort to persuade people that more than six lumps a day is 
harmful 
The shortages have been assailed in the news media and heatedly 
discussed in coffee shops 
The subject has come up in the Shura Council a government body 
of experts in various fields who give advice to Mubarak and to the 
Peoples Assembly the national legislature 
And in the Peoples Assembly itself Prime Minister Atef Sedki 
was taken to task because of his Cabinet ministers had denied that 
the shortages exist Sedki admitted they were not being entirely 
candid but he assured the assembly that Egypt once again will get 
by 
Food shortages are nothing new to Egypt The country must import 
60 percent of what it eats and it doesnt have the money to pay for 
all it needs In addition it increasingly has more mouths than it 
can feed as the population explodes at a rate of 1 million every 
nine months 
That coupled with stagnant food production has transformed the 
country from the food exporter it was three decades ago to the 
importer it is today The nation facing a foreign debt of 44 
billion doesnt have the money to pay for it all 
Nobody has a ready solution Increasing food production isnt 
easy because only about 4 percent of the countrys land area the 
Nile River Valley is fertile and little money is available to 
reclaim and cultivate the desert 
Egypt is among the worlds biggest producers of cotton which is 
the source of most cooking oil used in the country but it must 
import more than 80 percent of its needs at a cost of 250 
million a year 
We import 500000 tons of cooking oil at the cost of 500 a 
ton said Rifaat Saadawy an official in charge of oil imports at 
the Industry Ministry 
So the cooking oil crisis is connected with the foreign 
exchange crisis and any shortage in foreign currency means a 
shortage of providing cooking oil for local consumption 
Similarily despite expanses of sugar cane in central Egypt the 
countrys farmers produce only about half the nations needs 
forcing imports of 700000 tons for almost 158 million last year 
A further complication is that many stable foods are distributed 
through expensive subsidy and ration systems Under pressure from 
the International Monetary Fund and at the urging of the United 
States the government has been trying to reduce the subsidy 
systems burden on the national Treasury 
For the past two years it has tapered off the number of 
subsidized items available at government stores or purchased with 
ration cards from private markets But the items taken off the list 
cost much more 
Despite the cutbacks the government spent 22 billion in the 
198687 fiscal year on subsidies for food and other items Thats 
only 675 million less than the subsidy bill in 198384 and remains 
much higher than levels Washington and the IMF want 
The government does not want to eliminate or sharply reduce 
subsidies because it fears a recurrence of food riots in which more 
than 70 people were killed in 1977 
For peasants like Nawal Mohamedein who lives at elFaronia 30 
miles north of Cairo the system is not working 
The official price of a onekilogram 22pound bottle of oil 
was 80 piasters 36 cents but now it is not available in the 
shops she said I buy it off the black market for 35 pounds 
160 a bottle It has limited our food to next to nothing 
She said she now has to serve bread and cheese for the midday 
meal in place of the usual eggplant and potatoes
