The University of Massachusetts 
chancellor says he has great admiration for minority students 
who ended their sixday takeover of an academic building after they 
were promised remedies for campus racism 
Chancellor Joseph Duffey said the negotiations were conducted 
cordially with representatives of the more than 150 students who 
filed out of the New Africa House with their fists raised in a 
victory salute Wednesday afternoon 
I ordered Chinese food and I hunched over one word processor 
and they were at another Duffey said They were a very lively 
interesting wonderful group of young people We had a good time 
We also had serious differences 
Segun Eubanks 25 a UMass senior and a member of the protest 
group was one of the few students who remained in the 
AfroAmerican studies and cultural center where the only evidence 
of the protest was a sign outside reading Thanks for Your 
Support 
Basically I think this is the beginning this is the easy 
part said Eubanks I feel like weve won the first major 
battle 
The fivepage agreement between Duffey and nine of the 
protesters was reached late Tuesday night following nearly four 
hours of negotiations It included a promise to change the schools 
student conduct code to allow suspension of students who commit 
acts of racial violence or harassment 
Duffey also promised extensive renovation of the New Africa 
House and funds for educational and cultural activities for 
minority students And he agreed to increased funding to recruit of 
minority students and teachers but rejected a demand for student 
involvement in hiring faculty No amounts of funding were 
negotiated 
Duffey also consented to the formation of a student committee to 
monitor progress of the pact 
Prior to Tuesdays negotiations protesters dropped their 
demands to suspend or dismiss five white students accused of 
beating two blacks Feb 7 and suspend campus police officers 
accused of forming a lineup of blacks the same night in a search 
for men who allegedly harassed a female student The protesters 
said they were satisfied the university or courts would deal with 
the incidents properly 
The nature of this event had to do with a group who wanted to 
show the world their apprehenson concern and fear Duffey told 
reporters I have great admiration for the students leadership 
concern and courage 
Duffey however blamed the Feb 7 incidents more on alcohol 
abuse than racism 
The 150 students many of whom remained in the New Africa House 
during the takeover said they broke an earlymorning deadlock and 
debated the administrations response until just before noon 
Wednesday 
I feel like Im going to faint I havent been able to sleep 
and I havent been able to eat said Joella Costello 24 a 
junior who burst in to tears after the vigil ended But it was 
all worth it 
About 200 spectators including Amy Carter daughter of former 
President Jimmy Carter watched the end of the takeover which 
began Friday morning Miss Carter 20 was among 14 people arrested 
in November 1986 at UMass during a protest of CIA recruitment on 
campus She was later acquitted of trespassing and disorderly 
conduct charges 
Duffey discouraged a call by students for a moratorium on 
classes Tuesday and Wednesday to protest racism sexism and other 
forms of oppression 
Protesters claimed the present climate at UMass began with a 
clash between blacks and whites following the 1986 World Series
