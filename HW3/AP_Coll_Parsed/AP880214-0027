Esther Ruth Langford says she struggles 
daily to pay her bills and she counts on the 161 royalty check 
she gets each month from Exxon Co USA to help stretch her Social 
Security income 
But Exxon officials claim Mrs Langford a widow owes the 
Houstonbased company 37000 because oil pumped from her property 
and sold in the late 70s and early 80s was overpriced 
Theres no way in the world I could pay that Mrs Langford 
said last week Id have to sell everything Ive got And I dont 
know if that would do it or not 
Mrs Langford is one of 2300 defendants named in an Exxon 
federal classaction lawsuit The list of defendants includes a 
millionaire or two and other oil companies It also includes the 
Salvation Army and school districts 
Exxon is suing because a federal court decided in 1983 that the 
company had overcharged customers for oil pumped from the 
defendants land The court ordered Exxon to refund 8955 million 
and now Exxon wants the royalty owners to help with the restitution 
The defendants argue that they should not have to pay for 
Exxons errors 
They got their fingers caught in the till and now they want 
the people in Hawkins to pay it back said Gerald Langford Mrs 
Langfords stepson He is being asked for 49000 
Many defendants live in this pineforested community of about 
1300 They are original landowners their heirs or beneficiaries 
who receive royalties a portion of proceeds from the sale of oil 
and gas pumped from their property 
The Hawkins Field lies about 4400 feet below ground It was 
discovered in 1940 in 1975 landowners and heirs agreed to let 
Exxon pump the field as a unit believing they could increase its 
production and extend its life 
Oil from the Hawkins Field Unit should have been priced 
according to federal regulations implemented during the Carter 
administration but the federal government charged Exxon did not 
follow the regulations 
Exxon claimed the overpricing was the result of interpretations 
of complicated federal pricing guidelines 
As Exxon appealed the restitution order and lost the sum 
swelled to 21 billion because of interest Exxon in a statement 
distributed by spokesman Les Rogers said that since owners 
payments were based on the disallowed higher prices they should 
expect to help pay the refund 
Exxon said it warned royalty owners that its prices were being 
challenged and they might have to pay back some money they 
received and said the court permitted it to seek repayment The 
company settled with about 1500 defendants but time was running 
out so the suit was filed Rogers said 
None of the interest owners told us not to pay them at that 
higher rate No one told us to pay them the lower rate said 
Rogers 
I had nothing to do with it said Mrs Langford 62 They 
didnt consult me when they priced the oil They did that 
themselves She said Exxon sent her a letter asking her to 
settle but I didnt get that kind of income 
Royalty owners receive about oneeighth of the proceeds from the 
sale of oil and gas pumped from their property 
Exxon is seeking 104000 from the Hawkins School District 
which has elementary middle and high schools said Superintendent 
Wendell McGuire 
Any time you take 100000 from a program its going to 
affect it McGuire said Hes not sure where the districts 42 
million budget would be cut if forced to pay but expects the 
elementary school would lose a planned computer lab 
Some defendants are heirs and are being asked to pay back money 
spent by their parents 
Gerald Langford inherited his interest from his father They 
sent me a notice that I owed them 49000 I only had it the 
royalty ownership for three years he said 
Hubert Smith 82 settled The settlement includes an agreement 
not to discuss figures I dont think I should have owed it but 
it seemed as if I was going to have to pay so I got it off my 
mind Smith said I got them down to an agreeable sum 
Smith said he paid with royalty money he had saved and invested 
George Bramblett Jr a Dallas attorney represents Jarvis 
Christian College a predominantly black college in Hawkins the 
Meredith Foundation a philanthropic organization and several 
individuals 
Exxon wants the foundation to repay 4 million he said 
Our first line of defense is that Exxon has no right under the 
government regulations to seek this restitution said Bramblett 
They set the price on the oil and gas and if they made the 
mistake its their problem 
Hundreds of royalty owners have chosen to wait for the outcome 
of the suit which does not yet have a trial date 
I cant afford an attorney Mrs Langford said
