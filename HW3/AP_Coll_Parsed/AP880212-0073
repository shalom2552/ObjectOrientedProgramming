Rep Jack Kemp on Friday accused Pat 
Robertsons rival GOP presidential campaign of deliberate 
distortions and won a standing ovation from conservatives when 
he lectured the former television evangelist on the need to obey 
the Ten Commandments 
I cant insist that all candidates abide by Ronald Reagans 
11th commandment not to speak ill of another Republican Kemp 
said in an address to the Conservative Political Action Committee 
But all of us should abide by the Ninth Commandment Thou 
shalt not bear false witness he said to prolonged cheers 
Robertson was scheduled to address the group immediately after 
Kemp but bad weather grounded his airplane in New Hampshire and 
prevented his appearance 
But his campaign issued a statement calling the congressmans 
charges totally unfounded Connie Snapp an aide said 
Contrary to the charges we have investigated and found that no 
Robertson staff member was involved in the distribution of the 
material in question 
In Merrimack NH Robertson said We didnt put out any of 
this stuff hes talking about Its ridiculous what hes 
talking about 
Meantime Robertson and Sen Bob Dole of Kansas staying at the 
same hotel met for 30 minutes Friday night Asked whether they 
were striking a deal Dole said We just had a nice pleasant 
chat and a cup of coffee He feels good about his chances I feel 
good about mine 
When asked if he would want to inherit Robertsons supporters if 
Robertson is defeated Dole responded I said we ought to put out 
the melcome mat These are good people Theyre looking for a party 
to join in many cases 
Kemps demand that Robertson repudiate a television commercial 
being aired by his campaign as well as fliers distributed in early 
primary and caucus states reflected the stakes involved in the 
early stages of the GOP presidential campaign Kemps bid to emerge 
as a clear conservative alternative to Vice President George Bush 
and Dole has been damaged by Robertsons surprising showing in the 
Iowa caucuses and in other states making next Tuesdays New 
Hampshire primary a critical test 
Thus while Kemp said at a news conference that the Republicans 
would be taking a step backward if they nominated either the 
vice president or the Kansas senator he saved his sharpest words 
for Robertson 
Kemp avoided leveling an accusation of dirty tricks personally 
against Robertson but said the former ministers campaign was 
guilty of deliberate distortions 
I would like him to call off the flier and the ad he said 
following his speech I would expect a response from Pat 
Kemps anger was generated by printed material saying he was 
soft on pornography and suggesting that a member of his family had 
had an abortion Its a lie Mary Brunette a Kemp aide said 
of the abortion suggestion There is absolutely no truth in it 
whatsoever 
Distributed to fundamentalist Christian voters in Iowa New 
Hampshire and Minnesota the material purports to reproduce ratings 
of the Republican candidates by the Biblical Scoreboard which is 
published by Biblical News Service 
Jack Waldron editor of the news service said the material was 
altered and he described it as a malicious nasty underhanded 
attempt to smear men who are running for president and an obvious 
affront and attack on Biblical News Service 
The New York congressman also complained about a Robertson 
television commercial that cited a study by Washington Econometrics 
Forecasting Services saying that Robertson had the best economic 
proposal of all the contenders and Kemp had one that would bring on 
a depression 
The commercial cites a Wall Street Journal story on the 
forecast but Kemp said the newspapers coverage amounted to 
ridicule since it placed the report in a humor section 
In addition the Journal printed an editorial on Feb 5 
denouncing the use of its story in the television commercial 
Kemp in his formal remarks said he had welcomed Robertsons 
followers into the ranks of the Republican Party 
But the contribution ceases to be positive the cause and 
values that we represent are tarnished when such deliberate 
distortions are permitted to persist he said
