Classical clarinettist Richard Stoltzman played 
The Ebony Concerto with Woody Hermans Thundering Herd at 
Carnegie Hall in a tribute concert to the bands late leader 
Saturday nights concert sounded the way Igor Stravinsky 
undoubtedly meant it to sound when he composed it for Herman and 
his band in 1946 
Herman always said that in rehearsals with Stravinsky above 
Manhattans Paramount Theater and in the premiere at Carnegie 
Hall he and the band didnt really do justice to The Ebony 
Concerto 
Herman had planned this Carnegie Hall concert with Stoltzman 
not himself playing in The Ebony Concerto 
Woody Hermans Thundering Herd now is led by Frank Tiberi who 
joined the band in 1969 primarily playing tenor saxophone and 
bassoon Tiberi 59 called it a lifesentence membership 
Tiberi said that while Herman was sick he had said that his band 
should continue and Im going to continue with Woodys pattern 
and his sound 
The 15piece band isnt afraid to step into the classics like 
Faures Pavanne or a flagwaving bigband arrangement of Copland 
Fanfare for the Common Man played as the finale 
Tiberi two other tenor players and a baritone saxophonist 
blended well on Four Brothers The microphones werent kind to 
the bands playing of It Dont Mean a Thing if it Aint Got That 
Swing and Woodchoppers Ball 
Stoltzman also played a a medley arranged by band alumnus John 
Otto which began with a solo Amazing Grace Stoltzman played 
that with exquisite round tone and tenderness 
After America the Beautiful Stoltzman ended the medley 
playing loose inventive improvisations while the band came alive 
and stompmarched through The Battle Hymn of the Republic 
Stoltzman also soloed on a Bernstein medley called Songs from 
the West Side
