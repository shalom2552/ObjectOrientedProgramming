Two decades ago affordable housing and a 
good highway system lured dozens of major companies to 
Connecticuts suburbs of New York City Today highways are 
clogged 500000 homes are considered pedestrian and a corporate 
exodus may be on the horizon 
The waves of growth from New Yorks global market which once 
brought treasures to Connecticuts Gold Coast now threaten to 
erode some of its most precious economic gains 
Over the past year at least a half dozen big companies have 
announced plans to close or relocate their Fairfield County 
operations and many more are said to be considering such moves A 
recent survey of 300 local manufacturers found a third considering 
partial or total relocations 
The main gripe The suburbs which used to have the location 
without the cost of the Big Apple have grown so clogged with 
people and cars that life here is no longer a bargain 
Most people who make a move do a lot of looking and if theyre 
after big cost differences theres no longer a big cost difference 
between New York and Fairfield County said Peter Helie chief 
operating officer of the William Pitt real estate company which 
has 16 offices in Connecticut 
So if theyre looking for a lowercost area theyre bound to 
move off the East Coast 
Housing prices have soared so that many homes are out of the 
reach of even some twoincome families In Greenwich the average 
price of a home has risen from 86730 in 1970 to 706150 last 
year said Stanley Klein publisher of the Greenwich Record of Real 
Estate Sales 
He said the American Dream a fourbedroom home on one acre 
of land in Greenwich costs a family about 540000 today 
Howard T Owens a state senator from Bridgeport and chairman of 
the General Assemblys Transportation Committee describes the 
situation on Interstate 95 and the Merritt Parkway the regions 
major highways as absolutely horrendous 
Its gridlock from 630 am to after 830 A ride from 
Bridgeport to Stamford that should take 25 minutes takes more than 
one hour and if every aspect of mass transportation was used by 
the year 2000 wed still have hopeless gridlock Owens said 
William S Woodside former chairman of Primerica Corp said if 
some of these trends arent stemmed Fairfield County could become 
a pasture for top executives with little commerce because people 
who work in the trades restaurants and other businesses wont be 
able to afford to live here 
Woodside who moved Primericas headquarters to Greenwich in 
1970 when it was American Can Co is chairman of the Regional Plan 
Association an economic planning organization for the tristate 
region of Connecticut New Jesey and New York 
He said that when companies moved to Connecticut in the 1970s 
housing was affordable land was plentiful and an ample labor pool 
was available 
The county has changed dramatically already he said 
Greenwich has closed schools in the last 10 years and they do 
that because they no longer have enough kids to use the schools No 
young people can afford to live in these cities 
Evidence of a possible corporate exodus cropped up in 1987 when 
at least six companies pulled out of the area 
GeorgiaPacific Corp announced it would move most of its 
regional operations from Darien to its corporate headquarters in 
Atlanta The Fortune 500 forest products company employed 320 
people in Darien making it the towns single largest employer 
Revere Copper and Brass Inc which had moved from New York to 
Stamford about two years ago said it planned to relocate its 
headquarters in the Midwest 
Penn Central Corp said it would move its headquarters from 
Greenwich to Cincinnati 
Stauffer Chemical Co announced it would close its headquarters 
in Westport Its three main businesses were split up and the 
headquarters are moving to Shelton Conn Wilmington Del and 
Chicago 
Electrolux Inc said it would shift its headquarters from 
Stamford to Atlanta 
Iomega Corp returned to Utah only a year after moving its 
headquarters to Stamford 
Most cited the need for consolidation as the reason for 
leaving but one knowledgeable observer said the high cost of 
staying in the area was a contributing factor 
Essentially those who can break away and have no need to be in 
the command center of the global market are finding other locations 
and being in a sense pushed out or at least costed out by those who 
have to have that location said John Keith president of the 
Regional Plan Association 
A survey by the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry 
Association a coalition of business groups and the state said 
last year that twice as many manufacturers moved out of Fairfield 
County as moved in during the past five years 
Manufacturing generates 10 billion in revenues and provides 36 
percent of the jobs in the county said Al Petrikas president of 
the Wiltonbased Vitta Corp and chairman of the task force that 
directed the survey 
But John Mitovich president and chief executive officer of 
SACIA said he doesnt believe the bloom is completely off the 
rose in Fairfield County 
When people look at the region and see some traffic patterns 
some people like to attribute the erosion of businesses to 
traffic or cost but thats not completely it Theres a range of 
things happening he said 
Mitovich said some of the companies that moved to the region in 
the 1970s are no longer here because they have been merged with 
others or bought out 
Corporate executives at companies that have not announced any 
plans to move decline to discuss the possibility of relocating 
because it worries their employees 
But when Louis Harris and Associates the survey research firm 
in New York asked chief executive officers to name the best major 
metropolitan area in which to locate a business none of the 403 
executives ranked any Connecticut cities in the top tier They said 
Atlanta was the best location 
Overall the New York area which includes Connecticut does 
get a pretty bad rap said Merl Baker executive vice president 
of Louis Harris in New York
