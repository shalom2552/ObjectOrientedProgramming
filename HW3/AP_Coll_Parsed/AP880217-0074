The somber young man refused to walk 
alone from the building in which he had hid atop a steam pipe for 
six hours while a gunman below shot seven people to death and 
wounded five others 
I was there above him the whole time he was shooting said 
the employee of the ESL Corp as he left the defense plant Tuesday 
in the company of a friend he had called to drive him home 
Refusing to give his name the man threw up his hands to 
indicate he could no longer talk to reporters about the sixhour 
ordeal 
About 90 minutes earlier Richard Farley 39 of San Jose 
surrendered to police after the shooting rampage at the company 
that fired him two years ago for harassing female coworkers police 
said 
Shocked employees consoled each other before they slowly left 
for home 
Several broke into sobs while others cried hysterically after 
the ordeal said Daryl Anderson a business analyst who hid beneath 
her desk during Farleys sixhour standoff with police 
Anderson said several employees watched in horror as coworkers 
were slain 
Dr Luther Cobb at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center said one 
man who was shot four times told him he had looked out the door of 
his office to find out what the commotion was about and found 
several wounded people 
He dragged one wounded man into his office and shut the door 
but the gunman shot through the door killing the man he was trying 
to save and wounding him Cobb said 
Anderson was in her secondfloor office when she said she heard 
the gunshots I was under my desk in the fetal position for six 
hours she said 
Heather Scott the 13yearold daughter of ESL computer analyst 
Gregory Scott said she visited her wounded father in the hospital 
where he was reported in stable condition today after being shot in 
the face and hand 
He looked pretty good He said he didnt want to talk about it 
and I didnt really want to hear about it she said 
David Vossbrink community relations officer for the city of 
Sunnyvale said Farley recently had lost another job and was deeply 
in debt 
This guys life was falling apart said Vossbrink
