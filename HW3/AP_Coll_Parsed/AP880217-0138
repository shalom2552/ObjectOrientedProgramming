Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
Feb 10 
The Knoxville Tenn NewsSentinel on Navy mothers 
Call it outmoded thinking if you will but we find it disturbing 
that a large percentage of women in the US Navy who have babies 
are unmarried 
Of 789 activeduty women who used the San Diego Naval Hospital 
for childbirth from July 1986 through May 1987 323 were unmarried 
Of the latter 69 percent elected to stay in the Navy 
A fouroutof10 illegitimacy rate may not be considered 
astonishing for some but the Navy surely ought to hew to a higher 
standard 
This also is more than a moral issue Pentagon officials ought 
to wonder what effect this situation might have on national 
security Unwed pregnant sailors and mothers surely have more on 
their minds than defense of the nation

Hannibal Mo CourierPost on the court ruling against the 
Armys ban on homosexuals 
The court has the power and the authority at least until the 
ruling is appealed or overturned to direct the armed forces to 
admit homosexuals 
But the court would be hardpressed to enforce compliance with 
the spirit as well as the letter of the law 
Its far too early to tell how the court ruling will affect the 
armed forces 
But we can say with reasonable certainty that if the armed 
forces do not want homosexuals they will find ways of forcing them 
out court order or no court order 
The great majority of Americans still regard homosexuality with 
contempt and it takes more than a judicial order to change 
attitudes

The Orange County Calif Register on Postal Service cutbacks 
In most businesses if one company announces it will shorten 
hours and cut back service its competitors leap into action 
trying to win over dissatisfied customers 
Not so in the mail biz a legally protected monopoly for the 
US Postal Service Who loses The letter writers as usual 
With the Postal Service starting to cut back hours and 
eliminate Saturday window service and Sunday mail pickups the 
time is right for Congress to allow some semblance of competition 
for mail delivery 
The latest cutbacks in service are being blamed on budget cuts 
Congress in December trimmed 125 billion from the Postal 
Services appropriation for 1988 and 1989 
The Postal Service which should not be dependent on the 
taxpayers at all is woefully unprepared for that reality 
Forcing post office officials to sink or swim in competitive 
waters is the surest way to reform an otherwise highly inefficient 
monopoly

Palm Beach Fla Post on Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan 
Officials in Washington are treating as a positive step the 
announcement of a tentative timetable for withdrawal of Soviet 
troops from Afghanistan It is and they should 
Ever since he came to power in 1985 Soviet party boss Mikhail 
Gorbachev has been sending signals that he would like to end his 
nations bloody and unsuccessful attempt to impose a puppet 
government on the Afghans 
What makes the most recent statement important is that it 
contains dates full withdrawal over a 10month period beginning 
May 15 
The mood in Washington was that while the administration would 
prefer to see all Soviet troops withdrawn by the end of the year 
it should not throw up any roadblocks 
That is a sound decision

The Asbury Park NJ Press on Pat Robertson 
Pat Robertson has a long road ahead of him The dual nature of 
his background and candidacy can never be overlooked 
And while skeptics call him a preacher in politicians 
clothing his career suggests that he may be more like a 
politican in preachers clothing 
Robertsons real challenge is to convince the mass of voters who 
are not Christian fundamentalists that he would not allow his 
religious views to interfere with affairs of state while at the 
same time holding on to his invisible army 
But is America ready for a president with a pipeline to God 
as Robertson boasts Perhaps it is 
Ronald Reagan proved theres political capital to be mined on 
the religious right And like the president Robertson does have a 
way with TV cameras
