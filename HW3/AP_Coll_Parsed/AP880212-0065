The Environmental Agency hasnt proven it can 
legally authorize the retail sale of small amounts of the pesticide 
chlordane as part of a deal to ultimately take the antitermite 
chemical off the market a federal judge said Friday 
The agencys latest court filing does not satisfy federal law 
which requires the EPA to determine that a pesticide will not 
unreasonably harm the environment said US District Judge Louis 
F Oberdorfer 
The EPA believes that chlordane causes cancer To avoid a 
protracted battle with 197 distributors the agency has agreed to 
let them sell chlordane already in stock In return the companies 
are argeeing to cancellation of their licenses to sell the 
pesticide 
Oberdorfer however said the EPA had produced no evidence to 
back its assertion that distribution of remaining stocks wont 
cause undue harm 
The lawyer representing the EPA Steven Rogers argued that 
insisting on the use of the procedures in the law would in the end 
mean less environmental protection in this case because 
distributors could fight the revocation of their licenses and 
continue selling chlordane products during what could become 
protracted hearings 
The judge asked the National Coalition Against the Misuse of 
Pesticides to submit a draft order declaring use of remaining 
stocks of chlordane illegal but he gave no indication of when he 
might rule The coalition and others have been seeking such an 
order since October 
It is unclear whether the order will make a difference No one 
knows how much chlordane distributors have though the EPA says it 
believes the amount is very small 
The EPA concluded last year that excessive chlordane residues 
can remain in a home even after proper application Generally 
chlordane is injected under pressure into soil around the 
foundation 
The only manufacturer of chlordane Velsicol Chemical Corp and 
the EPA agreed last August that Velsicol would no longer sell it 
while the company tries to come up with an acceptable application 
method 
The company and the EPA later agreed to end use of Velsicols 
inventories but the stocks of companies using chlordane in their 
own products werent covered by the agreement 
After the hearing Bob Perliss an EPA lawyer working with 
Rogers said the companies had reported holding a total of about 
1700 pounds This would be 16 percent of the amount in Velsicols 
hands in August or a twomonth supply at the thenprevalent usage 
rates
