Former Prime Minister James Callaghan is playing 
fairy godfather to a childrens hospital in London by trying to 
change the law so it can keep earning royalties from the classic 
tale Peter Pan 
Author JM Barrie bequeathed royalties from the book stage and 
film performances about the boy who wouldnt grow up to the 
worldrenowned Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children 
But the copyright expired Dec 31 after the maximum 50 years 
permitted by law just as the 146yearold hospital launched a 
drive to raise 52 million for renovations 
Callaghan the former Labor Party leader who was prime minister 
from 197679 said Thursday he believes an exception should be 
made and he will seek to change the law to make Barries bequest 
permanent 
He said the initiative actually came from his wife Audrey 
chairwoman of the special trustees who administer funds bequeathed 
to the hospital 
Callaghan now Lord Callaghan after being made a life peer by 
Queen Elizabeth II last year said the hospital received a 
substantial amount of money from Peter Pan royalties 
He couldnt say how much because Barrie stipulated in his will 
that the sum should never be revealed British media have 
speculated it was as much as much as 875000 a year 
Callaghan said he hopes to introduce an amendment to the 
Copyright Designs and Patents Act next month that would enable the 
hospital to receive royalties forever 
It the amendment is in train he said Proposals have 
been put forward Everybody has been very helpful 
The Times of London reported Thursday that Callaghans proposal 
has the support of Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers government 
Callagahn was defeated by Mrs Thatchers Conservatives in 1979 
Lady Callaghan said there is a precendent for a perpetual 
copyright Parliament granted one to Oxford University for the Earl 
of Clarendons 1702 book History of the Rebellion about 
Britains rebellion and civil wars 
Clarendons royalties were once very profitable to the 
university In his honor the Oxford University Press named the 
building it moved to in 1829 The Clarendon Press 
Barries story about a boy who flew with Tinkerbell through 
nevernever land and triumphed over Captain Hook grew out of tales 
he spun for five orphaned boys he took under his wing 
The play was first performed in 1904 followed by a story 
Peter Pan In Kensington Gardens in 1906 and the play in book 
form in 1911 The play is attacting full houses at the Cambridge 
Theater in Londons West End 
The royalties helped Great Ormond Street Hospital develop a 
worldclass reputation Prince Charles had his appendix removed 
there as a child
