Ordinarily such tainted cells display an alien protein on their 
surface It serves as a sort of badge declaring Im infected 
But in one of its many tricks the AIDS virus circumvents this 
convention Some of these infected macrophages are filled with 
thousands of viruses but they are Trojan horses that give no 
warning of their cargo The body unconcerned mounts no defense 
even if such a defense would do any good which apparently it 
does not 
Once inside the infected cells bump into healthy ones and pass 
along their contents Within days the virus is established in 
tissues throughout the body Several kinds of cells eventually get 
infected including brain cells B cells that make antibodies and 
Langerhans cells a form of macrophage that penetrates most of the 
bodys tissues and lives for decades 
All of them have one thing in common Their outer skin contains 
a molecule called T4 Among them one variety of blood cell is 
special It is covered with so much T4 that its called a T4 helper 
cell A single cell may be coated with 60000 T4 molecules 
Of all the cells that the virus enters and subverts the T4 
helper cell is the only one it kills directly Unfortunately the 
helper cell is a critically important soldier in the bodys 
microbial warfare Its a kind of master cell that oversees other 
branches of the immune system coordinating their response to 
germs Without them this intricate system becomes chaotic 
aimless Parasites that ordinarily dont stand a chance run 
rampant Overwhelming infection and death are the unstoppable 
consequences 
But this final stage of the infection the phase called AIDS 
may come a decade or more after those first infected macrophages 
cross into their new hosts bloodstream full of virus looking for 
T4 
At first the virus replicates quickly Large amounts of it are 
found in the central nervous system then in the blood and finally 
in other secretions For a few weeks the victim may feel sick with 
aches and ills that mimic mononucleosis 
But then the symptoms clear up Production of virus drops to a 
trace Now the person is an AIDS carrier able to pass the 
infection on the others but looking and feeling perfectly normal 
For several years it may seem as though nothing is wrong But 
that is an illusion 
Something is happening during that asymptomatic period that 
eventually results in enough damage that the whole system 
collapses says Haseltine I think of it as a dam eroding The 
damage is being done but the dam looks fine 
At last the virus comes to life Levels rise in the bloodstream 
T4 helper cells start to die And the symptoms of AIDS set in 
Within about two years after those symptoms appear the number of 
T4 cells in the blood inexorably drops to near zero 
How does HIV get away with it In the usual course of viral 
surveillance the branch of the immune system called the B cells 
recognizes the invader for what it is and makes antibodies These 
are chemicals that tightly latch onto specific spots on the viruss 
surface and mark it for destruction 
People make antibodies against the AIDS virus too But they 
dont stop the bug Scientists arent sure why although they have 
some theories Perhaps the spots the antibodies need to attach 
themselves to are hidden deep in recesses in the viruss coat 
Perhaps theyre disguised with a covering of sugar Maybe the 
antibodies bind to the wrong spot on the virus failing to harm it 
Or maybe the virus simply stays one step ahead mutating its shell 
faster than the body can fashion new antibodies to fit it 
The viruss coat is made of a sugar and protein combination or 
glycoprotein called the envelop protein It has two parts The 
inner one called gp41 is imbedded in the surface of the virus 
Loosely attached to gp41 is the outer envelop protein called gp120 
Gp120 has an intense attraction for the T4 molecule on human 
cells When it finds this target it binds tightly holding the 
tiny virus to the rough surface of the much larger cell Then the 
gp41 takes over and fuses the membranes of the virus and the cell 
allowing the inner part of the virus to enter the cell 
Its goal now is to splice its own genes into those of the cell 
so it can turn the cell into a virus factory manufacturing 
thousands upon thousands of new copies of itself 
For HIV however thats even more difficult than it sounds for 
this bug is a retrovirus Like all creatures in nature the 
assembly plans for a new AIDS virus are contained in the coded 
material called genes
