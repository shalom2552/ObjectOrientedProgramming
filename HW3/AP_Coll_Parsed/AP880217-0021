Student protesters who have held a 
University of Massachusetts building for five days began 
deliberating a tentative understanding late Tuesday hammered out 
earlier in the day by their negotiators and university officials 
The students meeting was closed and there were conflicting 
signals on whether an end to the fiveday standoff which began 
when some 200 minority students took over the schools New Africa 
House in a protest of campus racial tensions was near an end 
Not all the students demands have been met but all have 
been responded to in good faith Chancellor Joseph Duffey said as 
he forwarded a written statement to the students There are 
things I cannot do now but weve agreed to plan to address general 
concerns 
Earlier university officials had said Duffey would be putting 
into writting a tentative understanding reached between him and a 
ninemember student negotiating committee during a meeting that 
lasted nearly four hours 
It looks like we have a resolution said James Langley a 
spokesman for Duffey after the meeting broke up 
But a student spokesman said late in the evening that the 
document sent by Duffey was received with mixed emotions by the 
entire student group and that discussions of what they would do 
next could last well into the night 
The vote is going very slowly spokesman Roscoe Robinson 
said Im getting nervous 
Earlier when the meeting with Duffey was still in progress 
Robinson had also expressed optimism on the way it were going 
saying he was pleased with the results 
Jeanne Hopkins university spokeswoman described the tentative 
understanding as an agenda for what well do where we will go 
from here 
Administrators did not release the document sent to the 
students but Dwayne Warren another student spokesman said it 
contained a promise of further efforts to improve minority 
students condititions on the campus including increased support 
for minority organizations 
The day also saw a rally by more than 500 white UMass students 
who supported the minority students protest 
Hey ho Chancellor Joe racism has got to go was chanted by 
students who were held back by black students linking arms to 
clear a path for Duffey as he walked toward the building 
Students and faculty also read letters of support including a 
message sent Tuesday by Democratic presidential candidate Jesse 
Jackson Some supporters had traveled from Albany and Philadelphia 
and local businesses and residents had sent protesters blankets 
pillows and food 
I came to see if they needed any help said Michelle Norman 
21 a senior from Pleasanton Calif who added that she was 
missing two classes to attend the vigil I think its a good 
cause 
Jackson a Democratic presidential contender who was in nearby 
New Hampshire for Tuesdays primary balloting called the 
protesters at 915 am to lend his support 
The students occupying the New Africa House have taken a 
principled position on legitimate concerns The quality of 
leadership in the state and country can be determined by how it 
handles such crises as this one Jackson said in a statement read 
by a protester 
The protesters had said they would meet with Duffey to negotiate 
on a revised set of demands which a spokesman for the group 
declined to detail They vowed to remain until Duffey agrees to 
their conditions 
The six original demands included a written policy against 
discrimination by the university prosecution of five white 
students accused of attacking two black men and a white woman on 
Feb 7 and the suspension of campus police officers who allegedly 
formed a lineup of black men when women complained of harassment 
Sara Lennox a German professor said 50 faculty members have 
signed a statement deploring the recent incidents and urging the 
administration to resolve the dispute 
A climate of hostility danger and racial intolerance must not 
be allowed to continue said the statement signed by members of 
an ad hoc committee to promote racial tolerance The group was 
formed in response to a fight between black and white students 
following the World Series in 1986 
The university rescheduled classes that usually meet in New 
Africa House to other buildings 
We see this as a shortterm temporary thing We dont want to 
escalate tensions spokesman Langley had said 
Between 50 and 200 students remained in the building through the 
long holiday weekend according to Robinson 24 of Boston 
Associate Dean of Students Rick Townes who is serving as 
mediator said the protesters were civil but determined 
There has been a resolve that this was going to be the last 
time they were going to make a stand Townes said This is not 
a movement led by radical students These are good students tired 
of dealing with this 
A session between the protesters and Duffy planned for Monday 
was canceled because Duffey left campus to visit an ailing brother 
The protesters sent Duffey a sympathy card signed by more than 
200 students Duffey responded by sending them a fruit basket and a 
card that read I send affection and respect 
About 9 percent of the 25000 students at the states largest 
public university are minorities There are 641 blacks enrolled at 
UMass and about 500 of them are undergraduates Langley said Total 
undergraduate enrollment is approximately 19000 students
