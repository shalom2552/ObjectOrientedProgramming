Belgiums largest bank Friday announced 
it entered a banking alliance with one of the biggest Dutch 
banks to form a major European financial group 
The Dutch Amro Bank and the Belgian Generale de Banque SA will 
try to set up an integrated multinational banking group within 
three years said Generale de Banques chairman Eric de Villegas 
de Clercamp 
Officials said the two banks launched the venture by acquiring 
partial ownership of each other and by putting funds into a joint 
holding company TUBA Holding International BV 
Each of the two partners has a 50 percent capital stake in TUBA 
which will be managed on a joint basis 
De Villegas de Clercamp denied that the agreement had been made 
with Amro to head off a possible bid by Italian investor Carlo de 
Benedetti who is trying to take effective control of Societe 
Generale de Belgique SA Belgiums biggest holding company 
Societe Generale has a 134 percent stake in Generale de Banque 
De Villegas de Clercamp acknowledged however that the battle 
for control of Societe Generale gave rise to the feeling that the 
banks clients trust and confidence may have been shaken 
He said Societe Generale which has three seats on the banks 
board had given general approval for the project but when it 
came to a vote the three representatives had abstained for 
personal reasons He did not elaborate 
Deposits of Generale de Banque amounted to 52047 billion while 
Amro Banks deposits 58343 billion based on 1986 statistics 
The Generale de Banque chairman said the two banks were forming 
the alliance to prepare for the intense competition which must be 
faced after 1992 
The European Economic Community has targeted that year for a 
complete end to barriers in the exchange of goods capital and 
trade among the 12 member nations
