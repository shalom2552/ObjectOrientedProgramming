Valentines Day sprints by all too quickly 
for some lovers but Peter and Maryellen Polichetti were prepared 
to make it a marathon 
The couple from nearby Lewisville took a weeks vacation to 
compete in the 1988 Great Dallas KissOff mindful that it took 
them 58 hours last year to win the marathon kissing contest 
But the Polichettis licked this years competition in just 4 
hours when the couples most serious challengers had to leave to 
relieve their babysitter early Sunday morning 
I couldnt believe that it would end so quickly said Peter 
Polichetti 38 He and his wife Maryellen 39 won a vacation in 
Jamaica for their latest victory which involves continuous kissing 
except for short breaks every hour 
Nine of the 14 couples who registered for the Valentines Day 
contest which raises funds for the American Heart Association 
decided not compete after learning that the reigning champs had 
taken a weeks vacation for the same purpose 
Hank Zecca Peter Polichettis employer at an area construction 
company and his wife Vickie proved to be the most serious 
competition for the Polichettis 
Our big thing was we didnt want them to win it in an hour 
said Zecca 38 We thought wed put up a little token resistance 
It got to be around 130 am and we said we have to go home for 
the kids
