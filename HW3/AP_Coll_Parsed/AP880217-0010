A smelt fisherman who fell into the 
Cowlitz River learned what its like to be netted when his fellow 
smelt dippers dipped him out 
Before I realized it I was in a very swift icy stream my 
waisthigh wading boots were full of water and they were dragging 
me under Elton Tommy Krueger who cannot swim said after 
his rescue Sunday 
Five other smelt dippers held out their longhandled nets to 
Krueger 72 of Wapato after he slipped in from the muddy river 
bank 
I grabbed and they dipped me out he said 
Krueger said he brought home a nearlimit of smelt not counting 
the four that he poured back into the river when he emptied his 
boots
