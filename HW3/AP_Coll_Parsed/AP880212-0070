millionairebusinessman David Murdock

their picture taken with Reagan and his wife Nancy during their 
45minute appearance 
The fundraiser was Reagans only scheduled event in California

less than three weeks notice there was no trouble lining up 
bigmoney contributors eager to mix with the president who was 
wounded by the IranContra affair and has only 11 months left in 
office 
The president will always be able to be a good fundraiser 
Donatelli said 
The money will go to the California Republican Party Reagan 
will hold another fundraiser later this year to help the 
reelection campaign of Sen Pete Wilson RCalif Donatelli said 
He said California is one of our top targets this year With 
its late primary the state could play a decisive role in the 
Republican presidential race With 47 electoral votes at stake the 
most of any state it will be a major battlefield for the November 
election 
A strong wellfinanced Republican Party will be a benefit to 
whoever the nominee is Donatelli said

night pledged to campaign vigorously for whoever our nominee 
is 
Reporters were excluded from the fundraiser at the home of 
Murdock who lives on the estate once owned by the late hotel 
magnate Conrad Hilton

Angelesbased Castle amp Cooke Inc which has revenues of more than 
1 billion and is best known for its subsidiary Dole Food Co the 
pineapple and banana distributor 
On Saturday Reagan will meet with de la Madrid in Mazatlan a 
resort area troubled by drugrelated violence 
A senior administration official who briefed reporters in 
advance of the Reagande la Madrid meeting said both Mexico and the 
United States are critical of the others handling of the drug 
problem 
The Mexican perception is that we are the worlds largest 
market for drugs cocaine marijuana and heroin and that we are 
not doing enough to reduce the consumption of dangerous drugs in 
the United States said the official who spoke on condition he 
not be identified 
At the same time he said the administration believes Mexico is 
making increasing but still inadequate efforts to fight drug 
trafficking The flow of drugs is increasing and in our 
view the amount of the drugrelated corruption is growing he
