As Maude Breen in the CBS miniseries 
Bluegrass former Charlies Angel Cheryl Ladd is a woman 
out for revenge success her own horse farm and a winner at the 
Kentucky Derby 
This being television and the windup of the February ratings 
sweeps the twopart series to be shown Sunday and Monday also is 
rife with intrigue backstabbing and social climbing There are 
lots of blue skies and green pastures beautiful horses and a 
rousing finale at Churchill Downs 
I play a woman who was raised in the area but is forced to 
leave after her father is accused of burning a barn Ladd says 
He was the farm manager and he took the blame for the son The 
son also tries to rape me at the beginning of the picture Hes 
played by Wayne Rogers 
Laughing she adds Hes so charming You just know hes a 
snake 
Bluegrass from a novel by Borden Deal also stars Brian 
Kerwin Anthony Andrews Shawnee Smith Diane Ladd Kiernan 
Mulroney and Mickey Rooney 
Filmed entirely on location around Lexington Ky it was 
directed by Simon Wincer who also directed the Australian movie 
about horse racing Phar Lap 
Maude is a kind of steel magnolia Ladd says I liked her 
because of that Shes pretty determined to do it her own way I 
liked that too I liked that shes not afraid to get her hands 
dirty She can dress up then turn around and put on jeans and muck 
up a horse stall 
Shes an underdog I think a lot of people will be rooting for 
her I grew up in a small town in South Dakota My aunt had a farm 
and my grandfather lived in an even smaller town I can identify 
with these kind of people And my husband and I have a quarter 
horse ranch in Colorado so I know something about horses too 
Bluegrass opens with some brief scenes that show Maude as a 
teenager and the unhappy memories she left behind 
They asked me if I wanted to play her as a 15yearold she 
says That would be quite a stretch It was flattering but I 
thought better of it What I really said was Get real 
Then it jumps ahead 15 years as Maude now a widow returns to 
buy a rundown farm with a vow of turning it into a breeding stable 
for winning thoroughbreds 
Ladd is married to producer Brian Russell whose Indian Neck 
Productions has turned out such films as Hoosiers From the 
Hip Flight of the Navigator and The Witching Hour 
Well go up to our ranch and load up some pack horses and ride 
into the mountains for four or five days she says Well pitch 
tents and live outdoors I ride a buckskin cutting horse named Half 
a Buck 
Its funny but I didnt have much luck with horses when I was 
a kid I had a bad experience of being thrown and kicked I thought 
there was something about me that horses didnt like 
On Charlies Angels I had to jump out of a Jeep onto a horse 
and ride out of the camera frame Thank goodness for the wrangler 
The horse looked at me laid his ears down and and went for the 
lowest branch The wrangler went after me and pulled me off the 
horse It was like a scene from a movie He said This horse is 
trying to kill you 
Whatever it was Ladd got over it learned to ride and has even 
been in a few races 
This is the third miniseries for Ladd who previously starred in 
A Death in California and Crossings Last year she was in 
the TV movie Deadly Care as a nurse battling her addiction to 
drugs 
Her next project may be an adaptation of a book she recently 
bought called Fulfillment about a Minnesota farm family at the 
turn of the century 
Theres talk of making Bluegrass into a series she says 
but Im not very interested in doing another series at this point 
in my career 
Nor is she interested in doing a Charlies Angels reunion 
All of us gagged at the prospect she says We didnt feel we 
could go home again Weve all moved on 
Ladd replaced Farrah Fawcett in the second year of the show 
Other longrunning angels were Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson 
Producer Aaron Spelling is developing a new generation of 
Charlies Angels for Fox Broadcasting Co
