critics

not a punitive action said GM spokesman Jim Crellin

to run an ad in a publication carrying or that recently carried a 
negative story 
He added that the ad section will not run in a later issue 
GM spent 750 million in 1987 to rid its board of Perot who 
founded GM subsidiary Electronic Data Systems Corp and several 
associates
