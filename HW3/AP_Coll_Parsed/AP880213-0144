Two US warships collided with Soviet ships in 
the Black Sea when they violated Soviet territorial waters ignored 
warnings from patrol craft and made dangerous maneuvers a 
Soviet admiral charged Saturday 
The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry Gennady I Gerasimov 
called the Friday incident off the Crimean peninsula an American 
military provocation and likened it to the 1960 downing of a 
U2 spy plane that forced cancellation of a superpower summit 
We hope that this will not hinder the process of improvement 
in SovietAmerican relations Gerasimov said of the warship 
collisions 
Gerasimov and Rear Adm Nikolai P Markov appeared at a noon 
news briefing to give the first detailed Kremlin version of the 
grazing of the cruiser USS Yorktown and the destroyer USS Caron by 
two Soviet navy vessels 
The Soviet Defense Ministry on Friday night accused the American 
vessels of violating Soviet waters but did not mention any 
physical contact between them and Soviet ships 
US Navy officials said the Yorktown and the Caron were 
deliberately bumped while exercising their right to pass through 
international waters 
But Markov and Gerasimov told reporters the US warships were 
knowingly violating Soviet waters and that the collisions were 
solely the fault of the American captains 
If we look back at history always when there is a tendency 
toward improvement in our relations we see some military 
provocation Gerasimov said 
Soviet antiaircraft units downed the spy plane piloted by 
Francis Gary Powers on May 1 1960 near Sverdlovsk The resulting 
uproar doomed a meeting planned that year between Soviet Premier 
Nikita S Khrushchev and President Dwight D Eisenhower 
Gerasimov said US Ambassador Jack Matlock had been summoned to 
the Foreign Ministry Saturday morning where Deputy Foreign 
Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh read him a strong protest over 
the Black Sea incident 
The Soviet side cannot but view the actions of the United 
States Navy as aimed at undermining the process of improvement in 
SovietAmerican relations which has appeared recently Gerasimov 
said reading from the protest 
Unlike the United States which claims a threemile territorial 
limit the Soviet Union claims a 12mile limit along its coast 
US Navy Cmdr Richard Schiff a lawyer said Friday in 
Washington that any country claiming a 12mile territorial limit 
must allow for innocent passage by the ships of all nations 
But Markov and Gerasimov said Soviet law does not provide for 
the right of innocent passage in Black Sea waters which the 
Soviets have longed claimed as their own 
Markov referred repeatedly to dangerous maneuvers by the 
US warships When asked to explain he said the Yorktown and 
Caron had been warned both before and after entering Soviet waters 
He said the two Soviet warships identified by Pentagon 
officials as a Krivakclass frigate and a Mirkaclass patrol boat 
were on a basically parallel course with the US vessels when 
the grazings occurred 
The larger Krivakclass vessel brushed the left side of the 
Yorktown while the Caron was grazed on the same side by the patrol 
craft US officials said 
US officials said the grazings were intentional but Markov 
said the captains of the Soviet ships did not have such an 
intention 
Markov did not name the Soviet warships but a small chart 
displayed at the briefing identified them as the frigate Bezzavetny 
and the patrol ship SKR6 
The official news agency Tass later quoted the captain of the 
Bezzavetny as saying the Soviet ships came within two yards of the 
American vessels when they demanded anew that they leave the 
USSRs territorial waters 
Without receiving an answer the Bezzavetny and the SKR6 came 
close to the US warships sides with a view to ousting them 
the captain Vladimir Bagdashin was quoted as saying No damage 
was caused to either the Soviet or the US ships 
Defense Department spokeswoman Susan Hansen said the two US 
ships have continued what she called routine operations The 
Pentagon has declined to say when the ships were to leave the Black 
Sea 
Markov said the Friday incident was the third of its kind in 
recent years 
In March 1986 the same two ships the Yorktown and the Caron 
violated Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea he said and 
two American warships penetrated Soviet waters in the Far East last 
year 
Secretary of State George P Shultz is scheduled to arrive in 
Moscow next Sunday to talk about a USSoviet summit meeting 
tentatively scheduled in the Soviet capital in the spring
