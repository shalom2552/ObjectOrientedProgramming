The Pentagon faced with an adverse court 
ruling has rescinded a virtual ban on security clearances for 
naturalized citizens from countries deemed hostile to US 
interests 
A federal judge who barred the Pentagon from enforcing the 
regulation against two naturalized citizens from Vietnam was 
informed by the Defense Department that the April 8 1987 
regulations had been rescinded and the lawsuit against them was 
moot 
United States citizens born in countries designated as hostile 
or who have resided in those coutries for significant periods of 
their lives will be considered for security clearances on an equal 
basis with naturalborn citizens government attorneys told US 
District Judge Thomas F Hogan in a memo filed last Friday 
On Feb 3 Hogan enjoined the Pentagon from enforcing the 
regulations against Phong T Huynh an electrical engineer at the 
Naval Surface Warfare Center and his sister Vien U Huynh a 
computer scientists at the same facility in Dahlgren Va 
The two had fled their homeland in 1978 by boat with other 
refugees and emigrated to the United States where they both 
obtained their formal education and American citizenship The 
Huynhs filed suit to challenge the regulations after being told 
they would likely lose their security clearances and their jobs 
When he granted an injunction in the Huynh case Hogan urged the 
Pentagon to rescind the regulations to avoid a lengthy court 
battle The judge said the regulations appeared to be unreasonable 
and unconstitutional 
The regulations generally barred security clearances for US 
citizens who had immigrated from 29 nations deemed hostile to the 
United States Besides Vietnam the list of countries included 
Soviet bloc nations Cambodia Ethiopia Iran Iraq Laos 
Nicaragua Syria and Libya 
An individual who was born in one of the 29 countries would be 
eligible to obtain a security clearance only if the person had been 
an American citizen for at least five years or has resided in this 
country for at least a decade
