A preliminary draft of a US Catholic 
bishops letter on women advocates that all ministerial roles be 
studied in terms of their openness to all persons in the church 
Portions of the draft prepared by a committee and still subject 
to change before presentation to the full body of bishops were 
read to an academic conference here by Archbishop William Levada of 
Portland Ore Religious News Service reports 
Regarding the ordination of women firmly rejected by the 
Vatican but increasingly favored in polls of American Catholics 
the draft says 
Continuing reflections dialogues and heated controversies in 
regard to the ordination of women demonstrate the importance of 
further study in order to deepen the understanding of this 
question 
Saying the Vatican does not consider limiting to the priesthood 
to males a question of justice or equal rights the draft adds 
It is acknowledged that certain reasons advanced in the past 
in support of the tradition arise from prejudicial attitudes toward 
women Such arguments as an example that women are inferior or in 
a state of subjection to men or are incapable of governing are 
rejected
