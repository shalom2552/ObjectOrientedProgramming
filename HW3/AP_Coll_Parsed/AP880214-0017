The owners of the building that housed 
Tootsies Orchid Lounge a legendary honkytonk frequented in its 
heyday by country music celebrities also own the right to the 
taverns name a judge has ruled 
Chancellor Robert S Brandt ruled Friday that Howard Dodson son 
of the late club owner Hattie L Tootsie Bess lost his right 
to use the name when he closed the tavern in 1985 and did not renew 
the trade name registration his mother had filed 10 years earlier 
Dodson had filed suit in 1986 charging that the buildings 
owners Mollye Ashe and her brother Abe Stein were illegally 
using the name of the tavern which his mother had operated there 
for 25 years 
What I want is my mothers name back Dodson said when he 
filed the suit in Chancery Court 
But Brandt said Ms Ashe and her brother did not invade Dodsons 
rights by registering the name World Famous Tootsies Orchid 
Lounge with the secretary of states office in July 1985 four 
months after Dodson closed the club 
Ms Ashe and Stein have leased the building to others who have 
continued to operate the tavern since August 1985 
Tootsies was located across the alley from the backstage door 
of the Ryman Auditorium where the Grand Ole Opry was performed from 
1943 to 1974 Parts of the movie Coal Miners Daughter were 
filmed there depicting the life of country music star Loretta Lynn 
Mrs Bess was famous for her hospitality and generosity and 
her tavern became a wellknown refuge for aspiring entertainers 
musicians and songwriters many of whom went on to achieve fame and 
fortune Brandt wrote 
But when the Opry moved to the Opryland theme park complex in 
the suburbs country stars dropped in less often and business in 
general dropped off 
Mrs Bess died in 1978 
Her sons decision to close the bar received considerable 
coverage in both the local and national news media From all 
indications Tootsies was closed for good Brandt wrote
