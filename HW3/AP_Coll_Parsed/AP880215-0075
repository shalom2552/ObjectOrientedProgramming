A top Chinese foreign affairs expert today 
criticized the United States for what he said was interference in 
Chinas internal affairs 
Huan Xiang director of the Center for International Studies 
under the State Council condemned the US Congress for its 
support of Tibets exiled religious leader the Dalai Lama and its 
criticism of Chinas handling of proindependence unrest in Tibet 
Huan writing in todays edition of the authoritative weekly 
Beijing Review also criticized Congress for passing a resolution 
in support of Taiwan independence and denied that China supplies 
Silkworm antiship missiles to Iran 
Some people in the political and press circles in the United 
States have a very strong sense of national chauvinism believing 
they have the monopoly on truth without considering the changing 
world situation and the interests of other countries Huan said 
AntiChinese Protests in Tibet late last year left at least 14 
people dead and dozens injured as Tibetan monks battled Chinese 
security forces 
Meanwhile in the central province of Shanxi delegates to a 
provincial legislature have called for an investigation of a top 
legal official in an unprecedented display of their powers an 
official report said today 
Eightysix delegates to the Shanxi Peoples Congress signed a 
motion to oust the procurator general one of the provinces top 
legal officials for incompetence the Xinhua News Agency said 
It is the first time such a highranking official has been 
subjected to the scrutiny of the deputies Xinhua said 
But the motion was defeated by a majority of delegates who voted 
to allow the procurator general who was unnamed to keep his post 
while the congress investigates the case Xinhua did not say when 
the vote took place or what the count was 
The official was accused of failing to act according to the law 
and mishandling a number of cases 
Peoples congresses serve as legislative bodies at all levels of 
government in China from the municipal to the national Citizens 
actually elect delegates to only the lowestlevel local committees 
which in turn send delegates to higher congresses 
The congresses long have been rubberstamp bodies with real 
power concentrated in the hands of the Communist Party In the past 
year however the official media have portrayed them as having a 
larger role under political reforms intended to separate the party 
from government functions
