A court ruled Friday that an egg 
producer who kept his 2000 hens in small cages was not guilty of 
cruelty to animals as alleged by animal rights activists 
The verdict is a great relief It would have been too much to 
be found guilty of cruelty to my 2000 hens Karl Wettre was 
quoted as saying by the national NTB news agency after his 
acquittal 
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 
claimed that by keeping hens in small cages Wettre violated 
national legislation to allow animals natural development and 
behavior 
But the court found that Wettre observed Norwegian regulations 
stipulating that a hen should have at least 112 square inches of 
cage space in which to live 
NSPCA chairman Toralf Metveit was quoted as saying Im 
disappointed but not surprised 
The society was ordered pay 15600 in court costs
