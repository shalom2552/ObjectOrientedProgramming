Fitness instructor Dick Woit is doing thousands 
of pushups a day all for the sake of a 7yearold girl who cant 
see 
The little girl from Turkey Dilek Erdogan was born with skin 
covering both eyes She has been in the United States only about 
two years and speaks little English But she and her benefactor 
restaurateur Matt Deletioglu have won the hearts of Woit and other 
residents on Chicagos North Side 
Woits pushups are part of a weeklong fundraiser at the 
Lehmann Sports Club to raise 100000 for a series of eye 
operations for Dilek who was brought to the United States with her 
mother by Deletioglu in 1986 
Deletioglu 44 a native of Antioch Turkey saw Dileks picture 
in a newspaper from his home country and decided to help her 
I had never met her he said but one picture was worth a 
thousand words 
For the past two years Dilek and her mother Guldane have been 
living with Deletioglu and his family as doctors at the University 
of Illinois Hospital work to open her eyes Drs Joel Sugar and 
Allen Putterman are donating their services but hospital bills 
have mounted 
It keeps going on and on Deletioglu said So he went to his 
fitness club to seek help in raising money 
Members of the club in return went to other merchants in the 
community and put together a weeklong series of events that will 
wrap up with a party and raffle Friday night 
Six weeks ago Putterman began the first of several operations 
that doctors say could allow Dilek to see He took lining from 
inside her mouth and used it to start forming an eyelid on the 
girls right side Sugar said 
In about a month we hope to reopen her lid and then attempt a 
cornea transplant Sugar said in an interview Wednesday Her 
condition is called cryptophthalmos meaning hidden eyes because 
her eyes are hidden 
Its likely Dilek will need about six operations on her eyes 
Sugar said And she will probably never have normal vision 
The likelihood is that her sight will be limited Our best 
hope is that shell be able to see enough to get around Sugar 
said If that fails at least she can be fitted with a cosmetic 
shield to help her appearance 
Deletioglu is known in the community for opening his restaurant 
to the homeless on Thanksgiving 
Ive known Matt a long time and I know how charitable he 
is said Bob Najman owner of the Lehmann Sports Club When he 
told me about her problems we volunteered to help 
Woit raises money by taking on challengers in pushup contests 
The club has pledged to donate 500 to Dilek for any challenger who 
beats him the challenger who loses must contribute Woits victory 
margin in dollars 
Its just something to help Woit said The important 
thing is what Matt is doing for this little girl Hes a giver
