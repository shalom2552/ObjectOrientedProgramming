Cuban officials boarded a USregistered sailboat 
Friday only hours after they released the vessel which had been 
fired upon and seized the day before a US Coast Guard spokesman 
said 
The three people aboard the Tranquility radioed a Coast Guard 
cutter out of New Orleans Friday evening that they were on their 
way to Key West according to Coast Guard Lt Cmdr Jim Simpson in 
Miami 
The 48foot sailboat fired upon and seized Thursday night was 
released Friday morning It had sailed northnorthwest some 25 
miles when it was again stopped and boarded by Cuban officials 
Simpson said 
They were again released and the three people proceeded on 
their way he said 
A passing merchant ship reported to the Coast Guard late 
Thursday that shots were fired across the 48foot Tranquilitys bow 
off Cayo Guajaba on Cubas northern coast Simpson said 
The Tranquility told the merchant ship by radio that it was then 
taken in tow by the Cuban patrol boats Reports from the State 
Department showed the sailboat was released early Friday Simpson 
said 
Crew members were two men and a woman whose names have not been 
released the spokesman said 
The Cuban foreign ministry has stated that the Tranquility had 
drifted into Cuban waters due to a lack of wind and was assisted 
into the port of Nuevitas and subsequently released a State 
Department statement said 
The appearance of the Cuban patrol apparently frightened the 
sailboaters into flight The Cubans may have fired warning shots 
because they didnt understand why their order to halt was 
disobeyed Simpson said 
They couldnt communicate he said The merchant vessel 
told our operations center that the people on Tranquility were 
speaking only English and the Cubans were speaking only Spanish 
Weve never had a problem with the Cubans harassing pleasure 
craft Simpson said At this point we dont even know why the 
Cubans would want to shoot at this boat 
Meanwhile Havana radio reported Friday that another 
USregistered boat carrying 7700 pounds of marijuana had been 
seized Feb 6 in Cuban waters and its four crewmen taken into 
custody 
The Cuban Coast Guard captured the Mary near the Las Tunas 
province area in northeastern Cuba reported a Radio Rebelde 
broadcast monitored here 
The arrested crew members were identified as Puerto Ricanborn 
Ivan Lancharte Ramiro and Cuban natives Lazaro Perez Garcia 
Inocente Hernandez Lores and Roberto Iglesias de Rojas 
Radio Rebelde said Perez and Hernandez left the island illegally 
in 1979 and that Iglesias left in 1980 All four were arrested and 
detained and the marijuana was burned the radio said The report 
did not specify whether the Cuban natives were US citizens 
Coast Guard officials said they had no knowledge of the incident
