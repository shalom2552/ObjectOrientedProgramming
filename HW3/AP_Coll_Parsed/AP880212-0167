Belgian financier Andre Leysen Friday 
failed to push through a FrancoBelgian deal to control Societe 
Generale de Belgique SA giving rival Italian investor Carlo De 
Benedettis bid a major boost 
Leysen could not get enough backing from a group of mostly 
Belgian investors to ratify an accord with the French holding Cie 
Financiere de Suez to restructure Belgiums biggest holding concern 
and keep it anchored in Belgium 
Leysen said he considered his mandate as spokesman for the group 
as over 
Because of the failure the battle for control for Societe 
Generale one of the pillars of the Belgian economy remains open 
Suez however said it is continuing discussions with all the 
Belgian shareholders wanting to cooperate in gaining control of 
the company that has a stake in a third of the Belgian economy 
It said Leysens decision to relinquish his leading role 
absolutely does not call into question the goal sought by the 
Belgian and French partners to restructure the 166yearold 
company 
Societe Generale has interests in about 1400 companies 
worldwide with assets totaling nearly 3 billion 
De Benedetti did not comment on Fridays developments He wants 
effective control of Societe Generale in order to use it as a 
platform for a panEuropean financial holding 
He also has offered to continue negotiations with the Belgian 
shareholders but has excluded Suez from such negotiations 
The Italian investor claims to be the biggest shareholder and 
says he can control through allies 38 percent of stock in the 
company He is launching a public offer Monday for 15 percent more 
In the public offer De Benedetti is willing to offer 4000 
francs 11430 per share 150 francs 430 less than Fridays 
closing price on the Brussels stock exchange 
The price had plunged 14 percent Friday from 4850 francs 
13860 and brokers blamed it on Leysens failure which caused 
many market participants to conclude De Benedetti had won the 
battle for control 
The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around Leysen said 
it had 28 percent of stocks in the company while Suez claimed 15 
percent Together with allies Leysen said they had a majority of 
shares 
But important groups within the coalition did not support the 
accord Cobepa linked to Leysen and Paribas a French rival of 
Suez has an estimated 4 percent of the shares of Societe Generale 
and said the plan lacked a clear industrial program 
The Belgian group uniting beer brewers Artois and Piedboeuf also 
failed to agree to the terms 
The accord was favored by the current management of Societe 
Generale which has come under sharp attack by De Benedetti 
Fridays developments followed a week of frantic negotiations 
between the three interested parties and threatened to defeat De 
Benedettis bid to create a panEuropean holding centered around 
the Belgian company
