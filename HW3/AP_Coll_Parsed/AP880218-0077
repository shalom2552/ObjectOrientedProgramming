Lots of folks head for the top of the Empire 
State Building when they visit New York 
But Australian Craig Logan who took his first trip to the top 
on Wednesday did it the hard way He ran 
It wasnt too bad really said Logan a 26yearold pastry 
chef from Melbourne after he won the 11th annual Empire State 
Building RunUp Still he said It gets a bit boring going 
around and around and around 
Logan who was married three weeks ago said he won the chance 
to compete in the Empire State Building RunUp by winning a similar 
event last August in a 56story hotel in Melbourne 
That one felt harder he said He attributed his victory in 
part to being the first man into the stairwell no small 
advantage considering the crunch of bodies that followed him 
Logan who finished in 11 minutes 29 seconds led a field of 79 
men and 27 women who thundered up the stairwell to the top of the 
102story building for glory fitness and the firstplace prize of 
a computer 
Eleven minutes after Logan crossed the finish line along came 
Navy airman William Savage No 77 of the 79 men Savage ran and 
walked to the top 
I didnt feel bad he said assessing his race afterward 
I was just dying 
Savage who is assigned to the aircraft carrier John F Kennedy 
in Norfolk Va said he grew up in Cold Springs Ky where the 
tallest building is about four stories and thats a barn 
So it was quite a thrill to be at the top of the Empire State 
Building with all of New York spread out beneath hazy blue skies 
Savage 29 is no neophyte to athletic competition or to New York 
City he competed last year in the New York Marathon and runs 140 
miles a week 
But I was still dying he said grinning wildly in defeat 
Winner Logan finished just a few yards ahead of Joseph Kenny a 
US Air Force physician from Cheyenne Wyo 
The top womens finisher was Olympic marathon hopeful Janine 
Aiello of San Francisco whose time of 13 minutes 43 seconds was 
28 seconds off her womens record in the event set in 1985 
Ms Aiello interrupted her Olympic training to compete for the 
fifth time in the Empire State Building event It feels great 
she said My mom was here my aunts from New York It was just so 
great to see their faces
