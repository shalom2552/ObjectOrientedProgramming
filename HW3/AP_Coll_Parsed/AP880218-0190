New Yorks highest court struck down a ban 
on loitering in subway train or bus stations Wednesday 
unanimously ruling that the statute gives police too much leeway in 
deciding when people are breaking the law 
The antiloitering law prohibits people from sleeping in 
transportation facilities or staying there without giving 
authorities a satisfactory explanation of what theyre doing 
The New York Court of Appeals said in its 70 decision Such a 
generalized law fails to distinguish between conduct calculated to 
cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent thereby 
failing to give a person adequate notice of what conduct is 
prohibited 
The court ruled in favor of two New York City men arrested in 
1985 for loitering in separate incidents at Penn Station and the 
Port Authority Bus Terminal Both were charged with other crimes 
after their arrests 
The court said the law gives too much latitude to a police 
officer to decide whether a persons explanation is satisfactory 
That Judge Vito Titone wrote makes the law unconstitutional 
Simply requiring a person to explain his actions also violates a 
citizens right to remain silent when questioned by police the 
court said 
He a suspect is faced with the choice of either forgoing his 
constitutional right to remain silent in the hope that his 
explanation will satisfy that particular law enforcement official 
or invoking his constitutional right to remain silent and being 
arrested Vitone wrote 
Barbara Sheehan who argued the case for the district attorneys 
office said Wednesday she would withhold comment on the decision 
until she has a chance to read it 
Michele Maxian a Legal Aid attorney who represented the two men 
arrested for loitering said the district attorneys office argued 
that overturning the law would make train stations and the Port 
Authority terminal havens for the homeless 
But if the law is no good lawyers cant worry about the 
unsavory impact of striking it down she said 
This decision is for ordinary people she said It says 
that you can be in the Port Authority terminal and not be subject 
to the whim of a transit police officer as to whether you have the 
right to be there 
Police still have plenty of ways to protect people from crimes 
Maxian said citing laws against begging trespassing and 
disorderly conduct She said police often used the loitering 
statute to arrest people they suspected of drug activities when 
they hadnt seen them engaged in actual criminal behavior 
Police are still going to be able to arrest people for doing 
crimes she said but they cant just arrest people for being 
suspicious 
The Court of Appeals decision upheld previous determinations in 
the cases by the state Supreme Court and the Appellate Division of 
state Supreme Court two lower state courts
