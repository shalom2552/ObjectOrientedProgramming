The Congress acknowledged the pressing need to reduce the 
deficit when in December 1985 it enacted the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act commonly known for its principal 
sponsors as the GrammRudmanHollings GRH Act 
This act committed both the president and the Congress to a 
fixed schedule of progress toward balancing the budget 
In 1987 the budget deficit was 150 billion down 71 billion 
from the record level of 221 billion reached in 1986 
This was also a record decline in the deficit 
To some extent however this improvement represented onetime 
factors such as a high level of receipts in the transitional year 
of tax reform 
Economic forecasters predicted that without action the 1988 and 
1989 deficits would be higher than the 1987 level 
In order to prevent this and to preserve and build upon the 
1987 deficitreduction progress in a realistic fashion last fall 
the Congress modified the GRH Act 
Specifically it required that the 1988 deficit target be 144 
billion and the target for 1989 be 136 billion 
Last year members of my administration worked with the leaders 
of Congress to develop a twoyear plan of deficit reduction the 
Bipartisan Budget Agreement 
One of the major objectives of the budget I am submitting today 
is to comply with that agreement in order to help assure a steady 
reduction in the deficit until budget balance is achieved 
The Bipartisan Budget Agreement reflects give and take on all 
sides 
I agreed to some 29 billion in additional revenues and 13 
billion less than I had requested in defense funding over two years 
However because of a willingness of all sides to compromise an 
agreement was reached that pared 30 billion from the deficit 
projected for 1988 and 46 billion from that projected for 1989 
In submitting this budget I am adhering to the Bipartisan 
Budget Agreement and keeping my part of the bargain 
I ask the Congress to do the same 
This budget does not fully reflect my priorities nor 
presumably those of any particular member of Congress 
But the goal of deficit reduction through spending reduction 
must be paramount 
Abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten our 
economic progress and burden future generations 
This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is 
possible without abandoning tax reform without cutting into 
legitimate social programs without devastating defense and 
without neglecting other national priorities 
Under the Bipartisan Budget Agreement progress toward a 
steadily smaller deficit and eventual budget balance will continue 
but this projected decline rests on two assumptions continued 
economic growth and implementation of the agreement 
If the economy performs as expected and if the Bipartisan 
Budget Agreement reflected in this budget is adhered to the 
deficit should decline to less than 3 percent of GNP in 1989 
For the first time in several years the national debt as a 
proportion of GNP will actually fall 
Reducing the deficit and the debt in this manner would bring our 
goal of a balanced budget and a reduced burden on future 
generations much closer to realization 
Moreover adherence to the agreement as reflected in this 
budget will ensure the achievement of additional deficit 
reductions in future years because in many cases the savings from 
a given action this year will generate deficit savings in 
subsequent years 
Given the good start made in 1987 we have an opportunity this 
year to put the worst of the deficit problem behind us
