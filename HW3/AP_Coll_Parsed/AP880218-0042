West German concerns about plans to modernize 
NATOs shortrange nuclear arsenal were being conveyed to Secretary 
of State George P Shultz and congressional leaders today by 
visiting Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
The importance of the weapons with ranges below 315 miles has 
loomed larger in recent months in planning by the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization for its defenses once intermediaterange 
nuclear forces are eliminated under a treaty with the Soviet Union 
Shortrange missiles are of particular concern to the Bonn 
government because Germany would be the battleground if they are 
used 
The West German government says the upgrading of shortrange 
missiles should be linked to an overall reduction in the number of 
the weapons and to progress in efforts to reduce the Soviet 
superiority in conventional weapons in central Europe 
The West Germans say NATO first must develop an overall arms 
strategy and iron out differences within the alliance before 
embarking on missile modernization programs 
West Germany sees no need for an isolated decision on 
modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear weapon systems at 
this point Friedhelm Ost chief government spokesman said this 
week 
Kohl arrived Wednesday and planned to meet with President Reagan 
on Friday 
US officials said before Kohls arrival that West Germany had 
gone along with the modernization decision when it was made in 1983 
and reaffirmed that support two months ago and that the Soviets 
benefited from the new concerns 
No alliance allows its forces to defend itself with weapons 
from yesteryear said Rozanne Ridgway assistant secretary of 
state for European affairs 
Another US official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
It is unfortunate the Soviets have managed somehow to jump 
right into the middle of all this and to suggest that there is 
somehow disarray in the alliance a crisis in the alliance on the 
question of modernization 
The chancellor also is expected to renew calls for quick Senate 
ratification of the USSoviet agreement to eliminate medium and 
shorterrange nuclear missiles those that have a range of 315 to 
3000 miles 
The accord which calls for reductions in the next three years 
was signed in Washington in December 
West German officials said Kohl also is likely to press for a 
worldwide ban on chemical weapons 
In a related development government spokesman Herbert 
Schmuelling denied news reports that Kohl would travel to Moscow 
this fall
