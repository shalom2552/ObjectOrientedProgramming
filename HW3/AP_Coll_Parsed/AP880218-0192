A judge Wednesday reduced the award to an 
83yearold woman struck in the eye by a soda bottle cap from 105 
million granted by a jury to 375000 
Third District Judge Kenneth Rigtrup said that jurors were 
inflamed with passion when they recently made the award to Mae 
L Roberts of Holladay 
The award of 10 million appears to be disproportionate and 
unreasonable Rigtrup said at a posttrial hearing He awarded 
75000 in compensatory and 300000 in punitive damages 
Roberts was struck in the eye when an aluminum twist cap blew 
off a 7Up bottle she was opening As a result of the injury the 
sight in Roberts left eye was impaired 
Rigtrup said Roberts could accept his judgment request a new 
trial within 15 days or appeal the decision 
Although there was no evidence that Roberts means of support 
was damaged by the accident the judge said 7Ups actions 
warranted a judgment for significant injury to her eye 
The company knew of the potential danger caused by the bottle 
caps since the late 1960s and has irresponsibly not remedied 
the problem Rigtrup said 
In arguing for 7Up Robert Henderson said new owners and 
management are concerned about the bottle cap problem and have 
taken steps to address the issue but solutions do not come swiftly 
He said between 1986 and 1988 the company knew of only one 
incident in which someone was injured with a bottle cap 
Henderson acknowledged 7Up is partly to blame for the accident 
but the fact that Roberts was attempting to open the bottle with 
pliers shows that she also was at fault 
Defense attorney Colin King said he will discuss the possibility 
of an appeal and said his spunky client just may seek a new 
trial despite her age 
Im as shocked about the judges decision as I was with 7Ups 
refusal to adjust the problem caused by unsafe bottle caps 
Roberts said This is a sad day for consumers
