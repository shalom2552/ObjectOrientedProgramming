Three months of violent protests have 
pushed this volatile nation to the point of political paralysis 
At the heart of the conflict is a stalemate between President 
Hussain Muhammad Ershad and his tenacious opposition The upcoming 
parliamentary elections only have compounded the standoff 
Ershad a former army general who seized power in a 1982 coup 
and subsequently was elected president refuses to accede to the 
chorus of protesters demanding his resignation 
The opposition which rarely articulates its ideology beyond 
saying Ershad must go and The people want democracy 
persists in calling a general strike every few days in Dhaka and 
other major cities 
The main opposition leaders Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia say 
the nearly 100 percent compliance with their strike initiatives is 
proof they have widespread support 
But random conversations with a score of merchants indicated 
that fear not politics is keeping the shops shuttered 
Oh yes I close Not because I support the strike but out of 
panic said Abdul Qader who sells housewares near the Buriganga 
River If I open somebody will loot and burn That is why I 
close I lose money about 1200 takas 3750 in sales a day 
Of that amount only about 312 represents profit for the 
35yearold shopkeeper who has a wife and two children 
Bangladesh has not had a peaceful transition of power since it 
broke away from Pakistan in 1971 
Hasina daughter of an assassinated president and Mrs Zia 
wife of another assassinated president launched their antiErshad 
campaign on Nov 10 
Since then confrontations between police and protesters have 
left 25 people dead according to the governments count 100 by 
Hasinas tally 
In addition more than 100 people were killed during election 
day last Wednesday most in clashes among supporters of rival 
candidates in local elections 
To try to counter the spiraling unrest Ershad imposed emergency 
rule Nov 27 banning public political activities by everyone 
except himself and permitting police to detain people indefinitely 
without charge 
On Dec 6 he dissolved Parliament and ordered new elections 
But Hasina and Mrs Zia refused to settle for anything short of 
Ershads resignation 
Hasina head of the Awami League and Mrs Zia leader of the 
Bangladesh Nationalist Party are boycotting the March 3 
parliamentary elections contending Ershad will rig the vote to 
favor his Jatiya Party 
We have to stop this election Hasina said in an interview 
Under him there cannot be a fair election 
Siraj a 35yearold truck driver had another reason for not 
voting 
In 1986 I went to vote and was told I had already voted 
said Siraj who like many Bangladeshis uses one name 
A small crowd gathered as Siraj spoke to a foreign reporter 
through an interpreter and one man heatedly told the trucker he 
had not spoken the truth 
Siraj then retracted his remark 
Ershads Jatiya Party which took 212 seats in the 1986 
parliamentary election is fielding candidates in all 300 
constituencies Sixteen unopposed Jatiya candidates already have 
been declared victors 
A hastily formed alliance of 73 small parties called the 
Combined Opposition Party is contesting 270 seats The alliance is 
visible mostly through campaign slogans painted on public walls 
Mrs Zia whose husband President Ziaur Rahman was assassinated 
in 1981 referred to it as a briefcase party 
The thirdlargest party in the election is headed by retired 
Col Farooq Rahman acknowledged mastermind of the 1975 
assassination of Hasinas father President Mujibur Rahman 
Farooq who says his funds come mostly from his Consociates Inc 
construction business in Libya founded the Freedom Party last 
August and is running 110 candidates 
Local and foreign analysts representing a broad range of 
ideologies say Ershad permitted the creation of the Freedom Party 
in an effort to restrain Hasina and the Awami League which was her 
fathers party 
Both Ershad and Farooq deny this 
Despite the array of candidates including 302 independent and 
minorparty candidates the election will not provide a test of the 
countrys major political forces since Hasinas and Mrs Zias 
parties are not running against Ershads Jatiya Party 
This election is not going to solve any crisis so why are 
these elections being held asked Anwar Zahid who resigned as 
information minister last month to protest the decision to proceed 
with the vote 
He subsequently was expelled from the Jatiya Party 
The election that is now scheduled is a sham election Zahid 
said in an interview 
There is a political stalemate The opposition cannot achieve 
The government cannot achieve There is neither victor nor 
vanquished and the victim is the nation
