As a 52yearold divorced farmer Frank Cook 
said he had little time left after caring for his cows hogs crops 
and children to find a date 
So he has become one of more than 600 farmers agribusiness 
workers or other people with rural backgrounds who look for friends 
and lovers through Singles in Agriculture a nearly 2yearold 
nonprofit group based in Wisconsin 
Farm people are special people Theyre busy and they dont 
have time to go to things Cook said in a telephone interview 
Friday Its hard to find someone when youre on the farm 
Cook who runs a 1000acre dairy hog corn and soybean farm in 
Baraboo is vice president of Singles in Agriculture 
The group which has members in just about every state and 
Canada schedules outings such as a campout in Missouri or a boat 
trip in the Wisconsin Dells and keeps a list of singles with rural 
backgrounds 
It does not emphasize making matches or pushing people to the 
altar but some of its members have married each other said 
Marcella Gahm 49 the groups president 
She met Marlyn Gahm a 53yearold beef cattle and grain farmer 
from Pearl City Ill through the group and they were married 
last June 
After the death of her first husband on the couples 
Staceyville Iowa farm in 1979 Mrs Gahm said she was like many 
farm widows who find themselves in a small rural town without many 
single people their age 
Most of her friends were still married They invited her to 
dinner or dances but Mrs Gahm said she felt like the odd one 
out 
She helped start Singles in Agriculture when 23 farmers who had 
written to one another through a farm magazine gathered in Peoria 
Ill in June 1986 
The groups members must be either be working in agriculture or 
have farmed in the past or have grown up on a farm It includes 
farmers who lost their farms during tough financial times and now 
have other jobs as well as secretaries who grew up on farms Mrs 
Gahm said 
Besides the time constraints to dating farmers need people who 
understand rural life in order for a relationship to work she said 
I think the agriculture person needs someone who is more 
willing to give than anyone can imagine she said You can have 
a date all set and if something happens with the livestock or the 
weather changes you have to cancel it 
A forecast of rain may mean staying home to bale hay instead of 
going to a movie she said 
The groups members range from the early 20s to 77 Mrs Gahm 
said Most are from the Midwest Wisconsin Illinois Iowa 
Kansas Missouri Nebraska and Iowa but there are members in 
several other states she said 
Marilyn Roette 50 of Chippewa Falls said she believes it may 
be more difficult for young people on the farm to meet other single 
young people these days 
Years back there were more country gettogethers Now its 
rare she said 
The gals go in the big cities to work and they dont want to 
come back to live and work on the farm she said 
Our main goal in setting this up Mrs Gahm said is to 
have people meet someone they have something in common with so that 
when theyre lonely they can pick up a phone and call or write a 
letter
