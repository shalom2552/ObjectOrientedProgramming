Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Wednesday 
made his seventh appearance before the grand jury investigating the 
IranContra affair presumably for more questioning about his 1986 
weekend probe of the armsforhostages deals 
Among other things the grand jury impaneled early last year by 
independent counsel Lawrence E Walsh is believed to be focusing on 
Meeses Nov 2223 1986 investigation that uncovered the diversion 
of armssale profits to the Nicraguan rebels 
In recent weeks the grand jury has heard testimony by Assistant 
Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds who found a memo 
revealing the diversion in National Security Council files and 
Assistant Attorney General Charles J Cooper another member of the 
team 
Former White House chief of staff Donald T Regan who was 
present when President Reagan ordered Meese to conduct the 
investigation and also when the attorney general reported his 
findings has testified recently 
Meese also has testified six other times before a different 
grand jury investigating his financial dealings with a former 
officer of the scandalplagued Wedtech Corp 
The attorney general has refused to comment on his grand jury 
appearances but the Justice Department says he is cooperating with 
the investigation and is not a target of Walshs probe 
Meeses investigation was criticized by congressional committees 
that held hearings last summer on the IranContra affair The 
panels faulted Meese for not recruiting Justice Department lawyers 
with more experience investigating criminal cases and for failing 
to take notes during interviews with top administration officials 
after he learned about the diversion 
The congressional committees said Meeses failure to secure 
National Security Council files allowed documents to be shredded by 
thennational security adviser John M Poindexter NSC aide Lt 
Col Oliver L North and others 
Poindexter resigned and North was fired after Meese announced 
that armssale profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels 
Poindexter and North are targets of the Walshs investigation 
Indictments are expected to be returned in the coming weeks
