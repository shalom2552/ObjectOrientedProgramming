Hospitals in the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip are overcrowded and increasingly 
overwhelmed with victims of Israels policy of using beatings and 
blows to subdue Arab protesters 
Last Wednesday at the Gaza Strips largest Shifa Hospital 
Palestinian doctors set the broken limbs of 24 Arabs clubbed by 
Israeli soldiers then swiftly discharged them to make room for 
more 
In the West Banks Nablus on Friday troops fired rubber bullets 
and smashed windows with their rifle butts to break into Al Ittihad 
Hospital and detain four Arabs suspected of throwing stones 
A wall was smeared with blood where docors said the Arabs were 
beaten and six windows were broken one punctured with a rubber 
bullet 
Besides treating scores of victims Palestinian hospitals have 
served as havens for Arab protesters trying to elude detention 
after antiIsraeli demonstrations 
Shifa Hospital has been a staging ground for riots by hundreds 
of Palestinians who hurled firebombs and stones at soldiers Troops 
stormed the hospital twice within two days in December and shot 
dead two Arabs 
This is a situation worse than on the TV serial MASH 
said Dr H Jack Geiger a member of a factfinding team from the 
Bostonbased Physicians for Human Rights that visited hospitals in 
the territories 
People are stitching wounds without gloves and without 
anesthesia These hospitals are completely inadequate for the 
treatment of this kind of trauma and do not meet an acceptable 
standard Geiger said last Wednesday 
As Geiger spoke at Shifa a large gingercolored cat wandered 
through wards that reeked with the smell of urine and feces Thick 
fetid water filled cloggedup toilets and sinks in the bathroom and 
a pool of open sewage ran on the floor 
At Alia Hospital in Hebron last week an Associated Press 
reporter watched doctors stitch up the wounds of Palestinian 
patients lying on bloodstained stretchers on the emergency room 
floor because all the beds were filled 
A doctor stitched shut a deep gash on the head of a 20yearold 
man shaking with pain while in a stretcher beside him another 
doctor set a mans broken forearm 
We work with the minimal medical standards said Dr Ahmed 
Yassih of Shifa which like Hebrons Alia Hospital is Israelirun 
Every time we operate there is a shortage 
One day there was no clean linen Another day no water Then 
no towels no sterile instruments Sometimes we work without 
electricity or have no silk thread for stitches said Yassih one 
of four Palestinian surgeons who perform most operations at Shifa 
Yassih said he discharged 45 Palestinians with beating injuries 
including 24 with broken limbs after only a few hours of treatment 
last Wednesday 
There just arent enough beds Yassih said We get more 
and more cases every day I have to keep at least 15 beds free for 
emergencies 
Lying in rows of narrow metal frame beds were dozens of 
Palestinians recovering from more serious beating injuries and 
gunshot wounds 
One 17yearold Palestinian student Jihad Al Achronz of Rafah 
was paralyzed from the waist down from a bullet wound that 
punctured a spinal nerve 
Another 14yearold Ahmed Al Khalud of Jabaliya refugee camp 
suffered epileptic seizures incontinence and paralysis of his 
lower spine and upper leg from a bullet wound to the back 
Youssef Hamad 40 screamed as doctors lifted him to examine a 
swollen black bruise from his neck to lower back Both Hamads arms 
and legs were in casts his bandaged head had 12 deep gashes and 
several ribs were fractured 
Hamad said he was beaten by 10 soldiers who accused him of 
raising the outlawed Palestinian flag on a Gaza City street 
Yasih said beating victims often were from the same family or 
section of a refugee camp and frequently were clubbed at night He 
said he treated 12 members of the Al Masri family from Gaza six of 
whom had broken limbs 
We find people injured in the same places over and over the 
upper chest legs back knees arms hands and elbows Yassih 
said He said about half the victims treated at Shifa had broken 
legs and 60 percent had broken hands 
Yassih also said many Palestinians were reluctant to go to Shifa 
or other Israelirun hospitals because hospital officials are 
required to give patients names to the army which patrols outside 
the hospital gate 
Three days earlier troops entered the hospital and took three 
Arab patients from their beds reinforcing Palestinians fears the 
doctor said
