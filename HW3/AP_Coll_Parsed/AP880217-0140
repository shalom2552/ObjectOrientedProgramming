The Wichita Kan EagleBeacon on Paraguays election 
What do you do if you hold an election and nobody participates 
nobody that is but the person in power and a couple of toadies 
What you do is proclaim a Great Victory afterwards and say how 
democratic you are for letting people vote like that 
This is what happened in Paraguay on Sunday Feb 14 when 
dictator Gen Alfredo Stroessner swept to an eighth fiveyear term 
as president by a margin of more than 88 percent 
The free nations of the hemisphere should react to Sundays 
fraudulent vote by declaring it to be just that and by reaching 
out as the United States already has done to the democratic 
opposition 
It is there that Paraguays future lies not with an aged 
dictator so unsure of his own rule and so fearful of dissent that 
he must fix his periodic reelection

The Woonsocket RI Call on the Iowa caucuses 
Its remarkable that over 3000 newsmen and women spent hundreds 
of thousands of hours covering the Iowa caucus and ended up shocked 
and surprised when Pat Robertson received substantially more 
support than Vice President Groege Bush How can that be 
If there is a lesson in all of this it may be that Robertson 
actually talked in detail about programs to deal with Americas 
problems while other candidates merely said they were capable of 
waving magic wands We dont think voters believe in magic wands 
anymore 
Perhaps others will now be forced to spell out their programs 
That would be refreshing We would like to know for example how 
they will solve the deficit question what they will do about the 
foreign trade imbalance how they will guarantee continued health 
for social security 
Win or lose Robertson may have forced this kind of approach on 
all candidates If so we owe him a considerable debt of gratitude

Charleston WVa Daily Mail on the presidential primaries 
Robert Dole and Richard Gephardt won Iowa Judging from the 
accompany hoopla one would think that these two are now ready to 
face off as the presidential nominees in the general election 
Unfortunately that is not the case The numbing 1988 
presidential selection process which actually began years ago has 
not even reached its peak 
The American presidential selection process is threatening to 
turn off the people it was designed to serve The grueling caucus 
and primary ordeal now stretches from February into summer It is 
too expensive too long and too arcane

The Sun Herald BiloxiGulport Miss on Pat Roberson 
When is a former television evangelist not a former television 
evangelist Apparently when he runs for president 
Pat Robertson is upset that some people persist in calling 
him a former television evangelist He calls it a bigoted 
slur saying he was a religious broacaster 
Robertson he also doesnt want to be called the Rev Pat 
Robertson anymore established his national reputation engaging in 
Christian evangelism mixed with political commentary on a TV talk 
show albeit on a network he owned 
How odd that he suddenly seems selfconscious about that

The Argus Leader Sioux Falls SD on South Dakotas Feb 23 
primary 
Any one of several candidates would make a good nominee but we 
believe Michael Dukakis would be the best candidate for the 
Democratic Party 
Dukakis lacks national experience but he is an intelligent 
pragmatic and forceful governor He has effectively presided over 
Massachusetts good economic fortune He is the top Democratic 
candidate 
We believe the Republican race comes down to Bob Dole and George 
Bush As we compare the two however there is one key difference 
leadership potential 
In that regard Dole stands out We believe Dole would be the 
best nominee for the Republican Party He has government 
experience leadership ability and a broad understanding of rural 
America and the rest of the nation
