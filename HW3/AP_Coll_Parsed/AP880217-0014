Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis claimed 
a great victory in the New Hampshire presidential primary 
Tuesday moving to the front of the Democratic field with the 
backing of his neighbors 
Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri the winner last week in the 
Iowa caucuses held onto the No 2 spot besting Sen Paul Simon 
of Illinois for the second time in a row 
Its really a great victory in many ways Dukakis said 
because these are the people who know me best and they had to 
test me not as neighbor but as a presidential candidate 
Its just a terrific boost Obviously its going to be very 
important as we go into the South and the Middle West he said 
But the Massachusetts governor would not claim the 
frontrunners crown Im wary of that label 
With all precincts reporting Dukakis had 36 percent Gephardt 
20 percent and Simon 17 percent 
Further back were Jesse Jackson at 8 percent Sen Albert Gore 
Jr of Tennessee at 7 percent former Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt at 
5 percent and former Sen Gary Hart of Colorado at 4 percent 
Gephardt said he did well across the state exaggerating his 
showing a bit by claiming The only thing we didnt carry was the 
Boston suburbs 
About a week ago they said we couldnt compete in New 
Hampshire Gephardt said Now he declared It appears that 
weve got a DukakisGephardt race in the rest of the country but 
that could change 
And the Missouri congressman said money is not a problem 
Were raising money at a good clip he said We are going 
to be fine for Super Tuesday 
That was not the case for Simon whose campaign was alrady 
500000 in debt before the primary 
This is not helping Simon said From the financial point 
of view if I were 3 percentage points ahead instead of 3 points 
behind it would make a huge difference in collecting money 
Babbitt was nexttolast and Hart last but both refused to end 
their campaigns 
This nomination is not won in one week or 30 days its going 
to be a sixmonth campaign said Hart who won New Hampshire in 
1984 
Hart who reentered the race saying let the voters decide 
admitted he would have to start doing better It will take at 
least 30 to 60 days to determine whether or not I can put together 
a viable candidacy 
Asked if he was going to withdraw Babbitt said No way Im 
going to move on to Washington in a couple of days and call and 
talk to my supporters all over the country and ask them this 
question how can we keep this reform movement alive Should I 
wage a guerilla campaign or should I withdraw or do something else 
 
Jackson said he was satisfied with his showing here Our 
message has won They outspent me 10to1 And yet a poor 
campaign a rich message has been successful in New Hampshire he 
said 
Gore said he did better than anticipated in New Hampshire and 
had no regrets about doing little campaigning there 
We made a decision not to spent a million dollars on two or 
three delegates Were saving that for the 1400 delegates here in 
the Super Tuesday states Gore said in Houston He was the only 
candidate who wasnt in New Hampshire Tuesday night 
Simon and Gephardt had been concentrating their fire on each 
other until the final weekend when both switched to ads attacking 
Dukakis 
I havent been watching a lot of television lately but Im 
told people have been saying some pretty nasty things about me 
Dukakis said I assume thats going to take its toll 
Dukakis was angered at Simons ad which suggested he is a 
technocrat who doesnt care about people Simon obviously does 
not know what hes talking about Dukakis said
