A toxic chemical spill snaking its way 
toward Lake Erie on Thursday forced the evacuation of hundreds of 
people and fouled drinking water for at least 22000 along the 
Sandusky River 
At least three people were treated for injuries after an 
estimated 100000 gallons of toluene an octane enhancer spilled 
Wednesday from a ruptured Sun Co pipeline south of here 
Five hundred people including 300 residents of Old Fort 10 
miles to the south were evacuated Wednesday and Thursday because 
of the fumes 
It could get worse said Sandusky County Sheriff Dave 
Gangwer It depends on how slow it moves and its slowing down 
rapidly 
The spill reached Fremont late Thursday and the city stopped 
pumping water from the river officials said They estimated a 
14mile section of the river was contaminated the river was 
flowing at about 1 mph 
Officials fear the spill killed up to 1000 fish many of them 
under ice in Sugar Creek and the Sandusky River and could affect 
waterfowl said Mike Taylor a wildlife officer for the Ohio 
Department of Natural Resources 
Gov Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency for Sandusky 
County which includes Fremont The declaration makes state 
assistance available 
About 4 million gallons of water one days normal supply was 
put in reserve tanks before the spill arrived said Gary 
Rathfelder assistant superintendent of Fremonts water plant 
Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or 
poisonous gases according to an emergency response guidebook 
published by the US Department of Transportation 
The spill was detected around 6 pm Wednesday after Sun workers 
noticed that pressure had dropped in the pipeline which carries 
the chemical from a Sun oil refinery in Toledo to a refinery in 
Marcus Hook Pa 
Sonya Elam a spokeswoman for the Ohio Disaster Services Agency 
said the chemical spilled in a swampy area in Seneca County south 
of Fremont population 22000 and then leaked into Sugar Creek a 
tributary of the Sandusky River The Sandusky River flows north 
into Lake Erie 10 miles north of here 
Ms Elam said Ohio Environmental Protection Agency workers were 
building a road into the swampy area and setting up a dike to 
contain the chemical 
Bob Arnet an environmental safety coordinator for the Tulsa 
Oklabased Sun Pipe Line said authorities had not located the 
leak 
Its been shut off but its still leaking Arnet said 
Neither EPA nor Sun officials could estimate how much of the 
chemical had entered the Sandusky River 
Two emergency workers were treated at Tiffin Mercy Hospital 
after they fell through ice and into contaminated water while a 
volunteer firefighter was treated after inhaling the fumes All 
were subsequently released 
Bud Davis a corporate spokesman for Sun said the company would 
take liability and responsibility for the leak 
Jack Fox operations manager for Sun Pipe Line a Sun Co 
subsidiary said the source of the leak was an 18inch split in the 
pipeline which is buried 3 feet deep and carries the chemical 
from northwest Ohio to a refinery in Marcus Hook Pa 
The cleanup could cost as much as 1 million and last three to 
four months Davis said 
EPA officials said they believed much of the chemical would 
dissipate by the time it reaches Lake Erie 
Don Higgins environmental coordinator for the Ohio EPA said he 
did not expect lasting environmental problems but added I 
expect quite a bit of environmental impact on Sugar Creek 
Its not the kind of stuff you want in a river he said 
It wont kill you but you dont want to be around it for too 
long
