Two landscapers charged with stealing a 
35foot magnolia tree admitted that uprooting the tree and hauling 
it away was a bad idea police said 
They said that they were really sorry they did it said 
Fulton County Police Officer Mark Smith They said they were 
going to put the tree back but they were afraid they would be 
caught 
Rick Howard Brown and Herbert David Bowles both 27 might avoid 
legal trouble if theyre willing to pay for the tree and fill in 
the hole where it stood 
Frann Faulkner Layton owner of the vacant house where the tree 
stood said Tuesday she would consider dropping charges if they 
make amends 
The tree was plucked Jan 30 by two men using a hydraulic shovel 
and truck police said Smith said the tree was replanted at a home 
several miles away 
He said Brown and Bowles were charged Monday with theft and 
ordered to appear in court next week
