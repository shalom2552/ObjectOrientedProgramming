marriage business is leading a wedding march from the courthouse 
to his own back door 
Liberty County CourtatLaw Judge LJ Boots Krueger built a 
tiny whitesteepled chapel he calls it The Chapel of Love

My chapel is unique People like the rural setting and the 
chapel gives a little more dignity to the wedding he said 
Its better than a judges chambers 
On a trip to Wisconsin he photographed a quaint chapel nestled 
in the woods He then paid 6000 to have it duplicated on his 
50acre ranch just north of here

Secretary of State Ken Hechler a 
lifelong bachelor remembers the most successful love letter he 
ever wrote Only it was for someone else 
It was during World War II and one of Hechlers army buddies 
was about to lose his girlfriend to another suitor Sensing that 
Hechler had a way with words the soldier hired him for 1 to 
write a letter to win her back 
I really poured out my heart Hechler recalled last week 
I wrote the most persuasive love letter I could dream up I had a 
lot of Shakespeare and Browning and other literary allusions in 
it 
The soldier more than satisified with the results copied it in 
his own hand and sent it off to his straying girlfriend 
About 10 days later he came up to me very distraught and 
waving the letter from the girl and he said What am I going to do 
now She says shes coming down and wants to get married this 
weekend 
But Hechler had a response to that too 
The dollar just covered the letter not the consequences 
Hechler said he told his friend
