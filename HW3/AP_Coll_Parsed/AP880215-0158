Former Gov William W Scranton is trading 
his briefcase for a bookbag as he phases out his ties to corporate 
America and prepares to return to college 
The 70yearold Scranton who sought the Republican nomination 
for president in the 1960s will enroll at the University of 
Scranton this fall as a student of Latin and Italian After 
sharpening his linguistic skills Scranton plans to study the 
Italian Renaissance the 15th and 16th century explosion of 
knowledge that led man out of the Middle Ages 
Ive always been fascinated with the Italian Renaissance ever 
since I took a course on the subject in my first year in college 
Scranton told the Scranton Times in a recent interview 
Scranton the recipient of 35 honorary doctorate degrees said 
he has always placed a premium on knowledge for knowledges sake 
While on vacation in Maine about a year and a half ago Scranton 
said he thought a lot about becoming old and decided to follow his 
own advice the best way to remain young is to mingle with young 
people 
For Scranton that meant returning to college 
Im looking forward to it Scranton said even though it 
will mean sitting in a classroom for the first time in 42 years 
since he got his degree from Yale Law School in 1946 
At the University of Scranton Scranton will study Latin under 
Dr John Wilson and Italian under Frank Cimini Scranton had some 
Latin in high school and college but Italian will be completely new 
to him 
Scranton has pared down his involvement with corporate boards 
from 21 to just four and plans to be off those boards by June 1 
However he said he will continue to remain active in boosting 
initiatives that can help the city that bears his family name
