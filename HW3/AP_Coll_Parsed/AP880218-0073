Denver may have the highest percapita level of 
education in the nation but you might not know it from an 
advertisement boasting that fact in Business Week magazine 
The fullpage ad reads Its really very simple Smart people 
perfer to live in the Mile High City 
Perfer 
Richard Fleming president of the Greater Denver Chamber of 
Commerce which paid for the ad said he was unaware of the 
typographical spelling error until a reporter asked him about it 
The typo certainly doesnt change the fact that Denver has the 
highest per capita level of education in the country Fleming 
said recently 
The ad claims that 81 percent of Denvers adult population are 
high school graduates and 26 percent are college graduates 
Dont overlay this he said I know its kind of unique 
But its not the stock market crash or World War III 
Its also not the first incident in recent weeks that has piqued 
Denvers pride Last month city officials and residents were 
angered when a CBS News correspondent reflecting on Denvers 
second straight loss in the Superbowl called it a town thats 
never been No 1 in anything but carbon monoxide levels

One hundred furry little creatures are 
starting to make the guest lists of hundreds of parties and 
conventions throughout the Midwest 
The starstruck rodents are participants in a mouseracing act 
that has turned into a good living for Ron Penland of Kansas City 
Mo and is quickly becoming a popular alternative to traditional 
forms of party entertainment 
Penland 38 has been taking his 100 mice on the road for 11 
years and the going rate now to set up the race track in Kansas 
City is a minimum of 350 
The selfdescribed Mouse Man set up his 16foot race track 
in Springfield on Tuesday as conventioneers attending a meeting of 
the Illinois Grain and Feed Association cheered on six of the 
racing rodents 
The mice scurried through the tiny doors at the starting gate 
and scrambled to the finish line They crawled over hurdles and 
passed pictures of cats along the way 
Penland says he doesnt encourage gambling but just in case he 
posts the career winnings of the mice in each race on a nearby 
posterboard
