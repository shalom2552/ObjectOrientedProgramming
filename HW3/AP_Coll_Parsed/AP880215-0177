The government said Monday an 
American television journalist and his associates were expelled for 
twisting the facts and having an openly partial stand 
The government of Panama and its people reiterate their 
position of open doors to all news media of the world within 
the legal ethical and moral concepts that govern the area in our 
country said a statement from the Justice and Interior Ministryd Tyrone 
and Della Rae Franklin 
The correspondent said an agent came to his hotel room Saturday 
night and told him to pack his bags and he was put on the first 
available flight to Miami He was the second CNN correspondent 
expelled from the country since last summer 
He and the network denied Panamas charges 
Reporters for The Washington Post and The Miami Herald have been 
refused entry to Panama in recent weeks 
According to the government statement From the first moment 
of his arrival in Panama Lamotte worked diligently to misinform 
the audience of that network about the political developments of 
Panama twisting the facts placing a morbid sensationalism on his 
reports and projecting a negative image of the country and its 
daily events 
It said the reports were openly partial to elements that seek 
instability and chaos in Panama 
Burt Reinhardt president of CNN issued a statement at the 
network headquarters in Atlanta saying The reporting by 
correspondent Larry Lamotte was fair and accurate The real problem 
is that CNN is widely watched in Panama as the only US news 
service carried by satellite in that country and the government 
objects to any unfavorable reports 
Last week CNN carried extensive live testimony by former 
members of the Noriega government who appeared before a Senate 
committee investigating the flow of drugs and money through 
Panama 
Lamotte said Monday in Atlanta I was objective fair and 
balanced I went down to Panama with the intention of covering a 
news story not with a chip on my shoulder or anything and 
thats exactly what I accomplished in Panama But objective 
balanced reporting is not what the government of Panama wants 
In another development a progovernment newspaper said Monday 
an official request would be made soon for the US Army Southern 
Command to leave its base in the former Canal Zone The Southern 
Command runs US military operations in Latin America 
El Matutino citing Foreign Ministry sources said the demand 
awaits only the approval of President Eric Arturo Delvalle 
Under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties the canal is to be turned 
over to Panama at the end of 1999 
Washington has been exerting pressure on Gen Manuel Antonio 
Noriega military commander and the power behind Delvalles 
government to step down 
Public demonstrations against Noriega began last June after the 
colonel who retired as second in command accused him of illicit 
activities ranging from corruption and narcotics trafficking to the 
assassination of political opponents 
Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in Florida earlier 
this month for drugrelated activities
