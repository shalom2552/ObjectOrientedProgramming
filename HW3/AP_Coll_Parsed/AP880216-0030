The mother of a 3weekold infant who received 
a heart transplant says doctors have given her son a 10 percent 
chance of survival 
Hes in very critical condition The transplant didnt go as 
well as we had anticipated Tabatha Stowe 20 said late Monday 
They dont quite know yet what went wrong They dont know if 
it was a heart attack or stroke It the heart just got tired 
out she said 
Jonathan Stowe underwent more than 10 hours of surgery Monday at 
Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh said hospital spokeswoman Sue 
Cardillo He is the youngest patient to undergo a heart transplant 
at Childrens she said 
Because the new heart is in a weakened state doctors have 
placed him on a special support system Miss Cardillo said The 
device takes over the pumping function of the heart allowing it to 
rest 
We hope it works she said If it doesnt he could be 
in all kinds of trouble 
Jonathans father David Stowe 20 of Beaver Falls said he 
hopes the new heart is just tired and will get stronger on its 
own 
Jonathan was born Jan 25 at the Medical Center of Beaver 
County weighing 79 pounds Doctors soon became worried over the 
failure of his tissues to receive enough oxygen 
He was transferred to Childrens two days later where doctors 
found he had hypoplastic leftheart syndrome a lethal 
underdevelopment of the heart 
Another infant who received a new heart because of the same 
ailment improved to serious condition Monday 24 hours after his 
transplant surgery officials of Loma Linda University Medical 
Center in Loma Linda Calif said 
The infant called Baby Christoffer and identified only as the 
son of an Air Force family had been in critical condition after 
the operation Sunday
