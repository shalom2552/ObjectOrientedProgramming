A man who first said strong winds blew his 
bride off a cruise ship now claims Israeli secret agents killed his 
wife in retribution for a book he wrote about human rights abuses 
Scott Robin Roston 36 who is being held for investigation of 
murdering his wife 26yearold Karen Waltz Roston made the 
allegation Tuesday in a statement released by his lawyer after an 
appearance in federal court 
Meanwhile the San Diego County coroners office said Mrs 
Roston died from strangulation associated with drowning which 
was determined to be a homicide 
Doctors performing the autopsy found contusions on Mrs Rostons 
neck as well as other signs she had been in a struggle according 
to an FBI affidavit filed in US District Court 
Roston initially had said his wife had been blown overboard by 
wind while jogging Saturday aboard the Star Dancer as it returned 
to Los Angeles from their honeymoon cruise 
The ships captain Thomas Wildung said winds were light 
In his new statement Roston claimed the agents drugged him 
leaving him with no memory of that night 
He said Israeli agents had tried unsuccessfully to kidnap him in 
the past and that US agents also had pursued him because he held 
documents showing US government involvement in what he called 
Israels gross violation of human rights 
He feels that this murder is the result of a book he published 
last year in New York City in which he exposed the numerous human 
rights abuses which he perceived in Israel said Rostons 
attorney Paul Potter 
Potter said he would seek a psychiatric examination of his 
client and added that Roston may have received a psychiatric 
discharge from the Navy 
Calls to the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles were referred to 
an official who was out of town and unavailable for comment 
At a detention hearing Tuesday Roston was ordered by US 
Magistrate John R Kronenberg to remain in custody at Terminal 
Island federal prison without bail said Mary McMenimen 
spokeswoman for the US attorneys office His next court date was 
scheduled for March 8 
Mrs Rostons body was found Saturday floating in the Pacific 
Ocean 44 miles southwest of San Diego It was taken to San Diego 
while the Star Dancer owned by Admiral Cruises of Miami continued 
on to Los Angeles 
Roston who had moved to Santa Monica in June from Lantana 
Fla was questioned by FBI agents upon arrival in Los Angeles and 
later arrested 
Books in Print lists Scott Robin Roston as the author of 
Nightmare in Israel published in 1987 by Vantage Press a 
vanity publishing house in which authors pay for the publication of 
their works 
The Rostons were married Feb 4 in Las Vegas Nev and shortly 
afterward embarked on the Mexican cruise they won in a contest 
Rostons father said 
Meanwhile the head of the California Chiropractors Association 
said Roston who has been identified as a chiropractor by his 
mother and roommate is not licensed to practice either in 
California or Florida
