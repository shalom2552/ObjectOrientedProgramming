Former President Richard Nixon said in the Sunday 
Times that Sen Edward Kennedy should run for president this year 
and his character would be his greatest asset 
In the first of a series of articles on the elections Nixon 
predicted if there is an economic recession this year any one of 
the Democrats will win If there is not a recession the Democrats 
cannot win without a charismatic candidate such as Kennedy or New 
York Gov Mario Cuomo 
Drafting Kennedy would bring the still potent magic of the 
Kennedy name to a party that had been demoralized by six months of 
fruitless campaigning Nixon wrote Kennedys eloquence could 
bring the party together 
The Massachusetts Democrat will turn 57 in eight days Nixon 
wrote If he is ever going to run for President a 1988 draft 
would be his best shot 
Kennedy who was born Feb 22 1932 is the least discussed 
but most logical candidate for a draft His greatest strength 
would be the character issue both its negative side and especially 
its positive side the Republican former president wrote 
No one will ever forget Chappaquiddick he wrote referring 
to a July 1969 auto accident in which he was the driver and a woman 
passenger was killed The question is whether people have 
forgiven him for it he wrote If the media hound Kennedy over 
that tragic accident 19 years agothey might well help him rather 
than hurt him and also land themselves in the political 
doghouse
