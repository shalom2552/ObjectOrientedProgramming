Defense Secretary George Younger said Tuesday that 
a refusal by West Germany to continue deploying shortrange nuclear 
missiles would leave a gaping hole in NATOs ability to back up 
conventional forces with a nuclear threat 
Younger also said he hoped NATO will make decisions as early as 
this spring on modernizing nuclear forces following the superpower 
agreement to withdraw their landbased mediumrange missiles from 
Europe 
I think they West Germany will talk about it a lot raise it 
a lot but not actually press it because it would leave a 
gaping hole in flexible response Younger said speaking at a 
lunch for American reporters 
NATO flexible response strategy calls for the use of nuclear 
weapons starting with the shortest range if conventional forces 
are being overrun 
The superpower agreement has provoked a furious argument in West 
Germany about whether to modernize or even maintain missiles with 
ranges up to 300 miles after the superpower agreement 
West Germany the East blocs closest neighbor sees itself as 
being left uniquely vulnerable to nuclear attack both as the main 
depository of shortrange missiles and the only Western ally within 
range of similar Soviet missiles 
By far greater danger faced by us and by Germany is the huge 
conventional imbalance those thousands of Soviet tanks which 
are ready to roll across the north German plains said Younger 
On modernizing remaining nuclear forces Younger said he hoped 
decisions could be made at NATOs military planning group meeting 
in April but this might not be possible until the autumn 
We shall be in a position to decide as soon as we see the 
proposals said Younger 
He said that if NATO lowers its guard now the Soviets will 
never agree to the proposed halving of superpower longrange 
missiles or do deals on chemical and conventional weapons 
His remarks reflected the British view that the United States 
should not negotiate with Moscow on eliminating shortrange 
missiles unless there is agreement to ban chemical weapons and cut 
Soviet superiority in conventional armaments 
Asked about a recent suggestion by US Defense Secretary Frank 
Carlucci that the United States might withdraw troops from Europe 
if West Germany rejected nuclear missiles Younger said any 
American troop withdrawal would send the wrong signal 
It was vital he said to NATO cohesion that nobody doubted 
Americas commitment to the belief that the defense of the 
Western free world starts in Europe
