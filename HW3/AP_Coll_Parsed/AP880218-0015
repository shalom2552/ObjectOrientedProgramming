Leftist guerrillas have struck 20 times 
in the past five weeks at the lifeline of the nations oil industry 
a 500mile pipeline that runs through some of the most rugged 
terrain in Colombia 
The attacks have raised the question of whether this South 
American nation will be able to maintain its oil exports 
The National Liberation Army has blown up parts of the pipeline 
13 times since Jan 12 temporarily shutting down the line and 
forcing Colombia to suspend its 137000 barrels a day of oil 
exports 
Another seven attacks did not damage the pipeline according to 
sources with Occidental Petroleum Co who asked to remain anonymous 
for security reasons 
The pipeline carries oil from the Canon Limon field in the 
northeast state of Arauca to Puerto Covenas on the Caribbean coast 
The field is owned half by the state oil company Ecopetrol and 
half by Occidental and Royal Dutch Shell 
Canon Limon discovered four years ago by Occidental was one of 
the worlds biggest oil discoveries in a decade With a billion 
barrels of reserves it was hailed as Colombias economic salvation 
At the time the National Liberation Army known as the ELN 
appeared to be a ragtag band of rebels The series of attacks has 
shown that the ELN has grown considerably in strength and that the 
army is incapable of defending the pipeline 
The bombings have caused 100000 barrels of oil to be spilled 
much of it into rivers and streams 
The pipeline was put into service Dec 7 1986 allowing 
Colombia to export oil for the first time since 1972 
The Canon Limon field is capable of producing 300000 barrels of 
oil a day but Ecopetrol initially limited production to 180000 
barrels a day That limit was increased to 215000 barrels in 
December 
An Ecopetrol source said the limit will be raised to 300000 
barrels a day sometime this year The source spoke on condition of 
anonymity because all information about the pipeline is supposed to 
come from the Defense Ministry which refused to comment 
Between December 1986 and December 1987 there were about 40 
dynamite attacks on the pipeline Many bombs didnt go off The few 
that exploded did little damage and the pipeline would be out of 
service for only a few hours 
But between Jan 12 and Jan 29 the ELN attacked the pipeline 
every day On Jan 12 there were two explosions that caused a spill 
of 27200 barrels of oil and forcing Ecopetrol to close down the 
pipeline 
The army and President Virgilio Barco said army patrols along 
the pipeline would be increased 
The line was opened again Feb 5 Barely enough pressure had 
built up to begin full pumping when an attack on Feb 9 destroyed 
120 feet of pipeline 
Ecopetrol was forced to close the pipeline again It reopened 
Wednesday and Colombia resumed its oil exports according to a 
news release issued by the Minister of Mines Guillermo Perry 
Crews in helicopters have little chance of spotting guerrillas 
in the dense jungles through which the pipe runs 
The rebels initially just tried to blow up pipe but more 
recently they have started keying on the lines big valves which 
cannot be repaired or replaced quickly 
The ELN first emerged in 1960 shortly after Fidel Castros 
triumph in Cuba It was organized by a Roman Catholic priest 
Camilo Torres who was later killed in a battle with troops in 1966 
The army estimates that the ELN has fewer than 500 combatants 
There are believed to be a total of about 7000 armed rebels in 
Colombias five leftist rebel groups
