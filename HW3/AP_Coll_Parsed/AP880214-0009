A family that secretly kept a mummified body in 
their home for more than eight years has been linked to a cult that 
preaches use of nutrients and exorcism in place of traditional 
medicine investigators said 
I think we are touching on something a group that hasnt been 
known before a group that is almost a secret society Knox 
County Sheriff Mark Shearer said in a story published in Sundays 
Chicago Tribune 
Shearer said those involved in the cult known as the Holistic 
Society included several suburban Chicago dentists but he would 
not identify them because of pending investigations 
Carl Stevens the man whose withered corpse was found in bed 
last month in his rural Knoxville home was a diabetic who was 
persuaded to rely on vitamins and powdered mixes in place of his 
daily insulin injections according to investigators and family 
members 
His body was found more than eight years after he died May 12 
1979 at age 40 His brother also died at a relatively young age 
and investigators were told that his death may also be related to 
unorthodox health practices 
The Holistic Society disdains traditional health methods and 
relies instead on an extreme form of holistic health care in 
which the mind and body are treated with only natural vitamins 
herbs and nutrients Shearer said 
Treatments are administered in a quasireligious fashion that 
involve the use of healing crystals the exorcism of black souls 
or Satan and channeling to communicate with spirits Shearer 
said 
There is no evidence that the health cult is violent or guilty 
of anything other than encouraging bizarre health practices for the 
unwary Shearer said 
In the weeks before his death Stevens had cut his daily insulin 
intake in half and was taking up to 20 vitamin pills a day 
according to an aunt Frances Kennelly of Lambe Mo 
Stevens who had been a member of the Knoxville High School 
Board of Education died after vomiting a black substance his 
42yearold wife Carole told investigators 
The only criminal charges in the case were lodged against Mrs 
Stevens a former nurse and former Aurora dentist Richard G 
Kunce 56 Both are charged with forging the dead mans name on 
legal and bank documents and with cruelty to children The 
Stevenses teenage son and daughter lived in the house with the 
mummified corpse 
Kunce who is in custody and Mrs Stevens who is out on bond 
have already pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to 
report Stevens death 
In another twist to the case investigators say they found a 
travel permit from the rightwing Posse Comitatus antitax 
group in the wallet of Kunce who moved in with the Stevens family 
18 months ago as their spiritual leader 
Kunce was introduced to the Stevens family by Carl Stevens 
brother Roger a St Charles lawyer who was apparently the first 
family member to become involved in the health cult Shearer said 
Investigators and family members said Roger persuaded his 
brother to use the vitamins and powdered mixes in place of his 
daily insulin injections and said Carl even began selling the 
substances from his office 
Roger Stevens died at age 43 in 1985 at a Chicago hospital His 
death was attributed to gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hepatic 
cirrhosis But a nurse who cared for him told investigators I 
think it was his diet that killed him according to the Tribune
