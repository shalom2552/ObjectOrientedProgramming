Gov Tommy G Thompson ordered attorneys 
Friday to go ahead with a lawsuit against Chrysler Corp but held 
out hope for a settlement that would preserve jobs at the Kenosha 
plant the automaker wants to close 
Thompson said Chrysler does not want a breach of contract suit 
to be filed over its plan to lay off 5500 auto workers at the 
plant in Kenosha which it acquired when it bought American Motors 
Corp last year and has expressed a willingness to negotiate with 
the state 
It would be better for both parties to settle this case 
quickly Thompson said at a news conference 
Thompson said Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca telephoned him 
Tuesday and that a meeting was likely soon between state and 
company oficials He declined to say where or when it would be held 
Chrysler announced Jan 27 it would halt production of the 
OmniHorizon autos Sept 30 
Attorney General Don Hanaway had advised the governor earlier 
that the state had a clearly enforceable agreement with 
Chrysler calling for OmniHorizon autos to be built in Kenosha for 
five years 
At a news conference in New York last week Iacocca defended his 
companys decision to close the aging Kenosha plantWe did not 
lie to anybody he said Why would we 
Hanaway said the state has a good faith basis for filing the 
suit And even though no contract with Chrysler was signed I 
dont consider this to be frivolous in any way he said 
In Chicago Chrysler Motors Chairman Gerald Greenwald said 
company officials were sorry the Kenosha plant had to be closed 
I guess you could say Chrysler was overly optimistic when it 
told workers and government officials in Wisconsin that it believed 
it could build the OmniHorizon small car at Kenosha for up to five 
years Greenwald said 
But we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no 
grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie he said We never 
made any hard commitments 
Greenwald said Chrysler always said market conditions would 
dictate the future of the plant 
Greenwald said Chrysler would repay the city and county of 
Kenosha more than 1 million the governments spent on improvements 
for the plant 
During Greenwalds news conference about 50 Wisconsin 
autoworkers picketed for hours in icy slush and 10degree weather 
outside his hotel to protest the Kenosha closing 
Outside workers carried signs bearing slogans such as 1st in 
Quality 1st to Close Work Hard Get Worked Over and Lee 
is a Liar referring to Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca who 
appears in television ads asking customers to trust Chrysler
