Members of the main Tamil rebel group the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam are suspected of being behind the attack a police 
officer connected with investigations said

Tigers attacked the temple because members of a rival militant 
group the Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam had 
sought refuge there

a Tamil homeland since 1983 often have been blamed for attacks on 
rival groups considered to be more moderate in their demands

Liberation Front which has vowed to attack supporters of a peace 
accord aimed at ending the Tamil separatist war More than 150 
killings have been blamed on the Front

war to an end

Tamils and has compromised the sovereignty of Sri Lanka More than 
42000 Indian soldiers have been deployed on the island under the 
terms of the accord to disarm Tamil rebels
