The Arab League on Thursday demanded an 
emergency session of the 159nation UN General Assembly to 
discuss US plans to close the Palestine Liberation Organization 
mission 
The 21nation league wants the assembly to shield the PLOs 
observer mission to the United Nations said a league spokesman 
Clovis Maksoud 
He was vague about how the assembly might accomplish this 
We cannot recommend at this moment a specific course of 
action he told reporters But if an emergency session was held 
it is expected the assembly would denounce the United States and 
say it violated the treaty under which it is host to the United 
Nations 
We are not seeking or eliciting a confrontation Maksoud 
insisted We are seeking that the United States abide by its 
treaty obligations 
The request came in a letter to East Germanys ambassador Peter 
Florin who is president of the General Assembly Florin is 
expected to approve the request said diplomats who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
The PLO which enjoys strong support at the United Nations and 
Arab diplomats have said they may ask the assembly to move to 
Geneva if the mission is closed 
The State Department had said the treaty obliged the United 
States to let the mission operate But Congress passed a law 
ordering the mission closed by March 22 The United States 
considers the PLO a terrorist organization 
Attorney General Edwin Meese III now must decide on whether to 
close the mission 
Reagan administration officials in Washington speaking on 
condition of anonymity said Thursday that Meese was expected to 
announce his decision near the end of March Several congressmen 
have said Meese assured them he would close the mission 
Maksoud said the Arab League wants the assembly to begin its 
session no later than Feb 29 
During its regular session which ended in December the 
assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on the United 
States to leave the PLO mission alone Israel was the only country 
to vote against the measure and the United States abstained 
Maksoud said the United States could avoid a confrontation with 
the United Nations if the law is repealed or if the administration 
refuses to enforce it 
Both possibilities seem unlikely The legislation had strong 
support in both houses of Congress and President Reagan signed the 
measure last Dec 22 despite the State Departments reservations 
The UN mission is the only PLO office in the United States 
The State Department closed the PLO information office in 
Washington last year
