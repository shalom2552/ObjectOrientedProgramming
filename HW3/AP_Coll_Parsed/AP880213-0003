Stage director Yuri Lyubimov who has been called 
the Soviet Unions greatest theatrical figure says he misses his 
homeland but welcomes the changes going on there since he was 
exiled four years ago 
I miss my theater my friends and my relatives but if I want 
snow I can always go to Canada or Chicago or call on Solzhenitsyn 
in Vermont he said in an interview at the Royal Opera House 
Covent Garden 
I also miss the unique Soviet audiences who hunger for 
something spiritual said Lyubimov among the worlds outstanding 
directors 
Lyubimov a youthful 70 this year became a citizen of Israel 
He lives in Jerusalem with his Hungarian wife Katalin and son 
Peter Another son Nikita is in Moscow 
Lyubimov talked to The Associated Press on Wednesday night at 
the stage door after an applauded revival of his production of 
Jenufa by Czech composer Leos Janacek 
Jenufa was first produced in 1904 and is a dark tale of 
peasant life murder and penance 
Lyuibmov ran Moscows defiant Taganka Theater and was on a 
London visit to direct a play in March 1984 when he became came 
under criticism from thenleader Konstantin Chernenko 
I was told I wouldnt be allowed to return home Chernenko 
was half alive at the time and dead 12 months later the director 
recalled speaking through an interpreter 
Lyubimov said hes hopeful that Soviet leader Mikhail S 
Gorbachevs policies of greater openness on selected subjects will 
last 
A lot of things once forbidden are now being seen in the 
Soviet Union films plays and books he said It would be a 
terrible tragedy if all this will be reversed like it was once 
before when Nikita Khrushchev was deposed 
But people coming from Russia tell me they really believe the 
change is irreversible and I hope all people of good will in the 
West will help he said 
The director said his name in oblivion after his exile has 
been restored by public demand to the Taganka Theaters programs 
for revivals of his celebrated productions 
Lyubimov said the Soviet and Israeli political climates are 
very different and Im trying to reconcile them 
The Royal Opera disclosed it has Lyubimov working on a new 
production of Richard Wagners demanding fouropera Ring cycle 
for opening in September 
Wagner a German composer of genius is anathema to many Jews 
who regard him as an antiSemite Wagners music has been shouted 
down at concerts in Israel 
Wagner is also little performed in the Soviet Union 
Lyubimov said I once wanted to to use the march from Wagners 
Twilight of the Gods in a festival music program but it was 
forbidden 
The Ring is performed in a variety of costumes these days 
from Viking style to modern evening dress Lyubimov when asked if 
his version will be traditional or modern replied Im keeping 
that a secret but I will try to use different kinds of symbolism 
and psychological concepts to bring Wagner closer to the people 
He said he was glad to be working on it with Bernard Haitink 
the Royal Operas recently appointed music director from Holland 
Wagners world is difficult to penetrate as he sought unity of 
all the forms music and drama and wrote a lot about it The hard 
part about producing Wagner is that what you see on the stage must 
not destroy what you hear the director said
