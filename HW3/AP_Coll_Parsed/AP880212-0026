A Texas prison escapee who robbed a credit union 
and then killed a policeman during a chase was shot 13 times by 
officers after his escape was blocked by a television stations 
helicopter authorities say 
Police also said the man Phillip Hutchinson 24 of Arlington 
Va had listed his goals for February and at the top of the list 
was penciled Get Money 
Hutchinson robbed the credit union Tuesday and during the 
ensuing police chase he ran over and killed Detective Robert 
Wallis 51 
After running into a tree he took John Laurienti hostage and 
forced him to drive him in his pickup truck A KCNCTV helicopter 
piloted by Mike Silva followed Hutchinson and blocked his escape in 
a parking lot and officers shot him to death in the truck cab 
Laurienti escaped injury except for a cut from flying glass 
The chase and the final confrontation were videotaped by a 
cameraman riding with Silva 
Adams County sheriffs Sgt Fred Stoll said that because of the 
many entrance and exit wounds on Hutchinsons body investigators 
had difficulty telling how many times he had been shot 
But my guess is 13 times he said Thursday 
According to authorities Hutchinson was a Marine deserter with 
a long criminal record including escape robbery forgery and the 
ransom kidnapping of a 13yearold boy who escaped unharmed 
He escaped from Texas Ferguson prison unit in September 1984 
and was recaptured four months later In July while serving a life 
sentence for aggravated robbery and other charges Hutchinson 
hotwired a truck and drove it through a prison fence He had 
eluded authorities since then 
Stoll said police found the list of goals among piles of papers 
in Hutchinsons mountain home near Bailey 
He was known to write detailed strategies and contingency plans 
in advance of his crimes but investigators have not found plans 
for Tuesdays credit union office robbery which netted 3000 
Meanwhile Laurienti 73 was given a new truck Friday to 
replace the one damaged in the gun battle 
The truck was purchased for him by a dealership and KCNCTV 
Laurienti had refused to obey Hutchinsons order to ram the 
stations helicopter after Silva landed in front of them 
Laurienti embraced Silva when they met for the first time 
Friday and they discussed Tuesdays ordeal 
God bless this guy Laurienti said He Hutchinson could 
have blew my brains out but I wasnt going to ram this guy
