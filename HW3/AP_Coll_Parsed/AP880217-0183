George Bushs surprising showing in the New 
Hampshire primary marks a volatility in voter decisionmaking that 
may continue to trouble pollsters as the 1988 campaign unfolds 
analysts said Wednesday 
Preelection polls released as late as Tuesday morning generally 
missed the extent of the lastminute swing that gave Bush his 
9point victory over Kansas Sen Bob Dole they said Most surveys 
had indicated a dead heat 
Its the timing and the volatility of this Nothing is 
anchored said Andrew Kohut president of the Gallup 
Organization whose final New Hampshire poll had put Bush 8 points 
behind Dole Theres a lot of bouncing around 
The problem is an old one for pollsters Their surveys are out 
of date as soon as they are completed and cannot account for voter 
turnout or for very late changes brought about by advertising or 
campaign organization 
For many years there has been a feeling that preprimary 
polling is hazardous to ones health in the early states in 
particular This year on the Republican side thats how it was 
said Laurily Epstein pollster for NBC News People change their 
minds and you cant poll for that 
Epstein and others noted that the polls had correctly tracked 
trends in the race if not anticipating the precise outcome All 
showed Bush well ahead last month then slipping badly after Dole 
and Pat Robertson beat him in the Iowa caucuses Feb 8 They had 
Dole taking a narrow lead by Friday then Bush rebounding to a thin 
edge during the weekend and Monday 
The tracking polls understated the size of his win But 
tracking polls are only an indication of expectations beforehand 
said Warren Mitofsky polling chief for CBS News The thing that 
polls can do best is show you direction It showed the direction 
the movement to Bush the last few days 
The final CBS NewsNew York Times survey done Sunday and 
Monday had a 4point lead for Bush 34 to 30 for Dole The final 
result was within the surveys margin of sampling error of 6 
points The last ABCWashington Post poll with results from 
Saturday through Monday had it 32 to 30 for Dole the Boston Globe 
had it 3130 for Bush and the Boston HeraldWBZ poll had it 3230 
for Bush NBC News eschewed late polling 
The greatest gap was for Gallup whose last poll done from 
Friday to 4 pm Sunday had Dole with 35 percent and Bush with 27 
Kohut said the dichotomy between that poll and the BushDole result 
would prompt changes at Gallup later polling if possible and 
greater sensitivity to the vagaries of candidates support 
In retrospect Kohut said twothirds of Bushs backers had told 
Gallup they supported the vice president strongly while only half 
of Doles supporters said they felt strongly about him The finding 
was an indication of Bushs ability to turn out his vote and 
Doles weakness in that area 
We knew Bushs support was strong and Doles was soft but we 
didnt put enough emphasis on that Kohut said The lesson is 
that even if a frontrunners lead seems stable it remains 
vulnerable to lastminute changes if it is soft Not pointing that 
out was a real failure on our part
