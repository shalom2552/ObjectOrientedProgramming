Gillette Co announced Friday the settlement of 16 
lawsuits brought against the company and its directors in 1986 by 
Revlon Group Inc after it abandoned efforts to gain control of 
Gillette 
The settlement subject to US District Court review requires 
Gillettes nonemployee directors to fully evaluate all takeover 
proposals and stock repurchase agreements for the next three years

takeover bids and make certain public statements about the offers 
In addition Gillette must pay up to 550000 to cover legal 
fees as part of the settlement 
Fourteen class action suits were filed by Revlon on behalf of 
Gillette shareholders shortly after the company signed a November 
1986 agreement prohibiting any attempts to takeover Gillette for 10 
years Two other suits were filed in 1987 as amendments to the 
original suits 
Revlon made two offers for Gillette the latest a 54 billion 
stock buyout bid in 1986

2925 a share following the agreement said Gillette spokesman 
David Fausch 
Revlon had acquired 14 percent of stock from Gillette which is 
presently facing a takeover attempt by New Yorkbased Coniston 
Partners
