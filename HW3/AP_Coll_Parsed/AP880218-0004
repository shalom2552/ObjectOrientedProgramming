History buffs organizing reenactments 
of major Civil War battles this summer are running into the same 
problem Gens Ulysses S Grant and Robert E Lee faced 125 years 
ago not enough Billy Yanks and Johnny Rebs to go around 
There are so many reenactments planned that you could stay 
busy just about every weekend said Charles Sullivan a member of 
Stanfords Mississippi Battery 
But the Civil War fanatics who dress up in blue or gray to camp 
out and charge through fields in battlefield reenactments have a 
manpower solution that was not available in the Civil War fight 
for both sides 
Sometimes you have to hastily reorganize your loyalties if you 
want to be part of something said Sullivan who in more sedate 
moments is chairman of the social studies department at Mississippi 
Gulf Coast Junior College 
This summer is an especially busy period because two of the 
key battles of the Civil War Vicksburg and Gettysburg occurred 
at virtually the same time he said 
Gettysburg activities will take place in the weeks leading up to 
the 125th anniversary of the battle which was fought July 13 
1863 while the Vicksburg reenactment is planned for the July 
Fourth weekend when that Rebel stronghold on the Mississippi River 
fell to Grants army 
Last year more than 40000 people watched as 6000 buffs 
recreated the bloody battle of Shiloh in Tennessee where 
Confederate troops surprised Grants troops on April 6 1862 The 
Rebels were defeated in a twoday battle 
Thousands of reenactors belong to groups of Civil War buffs 
but demand has been so intense that several events including an 
annual recreation of the Battle of Champion Hill have had to be 
rescheduled 
Champion Hill was fought on May 16 1863 and paved the way to 
Vicksburg for Union troops It will be observed in March this year 
because it would have conflicted with preparations for the 
Gettysburg event 
Sullivan said that to deal with changing demands many 
reenactors carry two sets of uniforms so that at a moments notice 
they can march as either a Rebel or a Yankee 
Leyland French operator of an antebellum tour home here said 
that by staging Vicksburg activities immediately after those at 
Gettysburg It may be possible for more people to make both 
events 
Weve talked with representives of 41st Illinois Infantry who 
plan a weekend encampment and we had a call this week from a 
gentleman in Missouri who wants to bring a group said Lenore 
Barkley executive director of the Vicksburg Convention and 
Visitors Bureau 
While Gettysburg is perhaps the bestremembered clash of the 
Civil War the fall of Vicksburg on July 4 1863 was a vital 
strategic loss to the South leaving the Confederacy almost cut in 
two and giving control of the Mississippi to the North 
The siege began May 18 1863 and ended when Confederate Gen 
John C Pemberton out of food and water surrendered on July 
Fourth 
The battle fought in trenches enventually involved 100000 
men some 50000 fewer than marched into battle at Gettysburg 
where Lees invasion of Pennsylvania was turned back 
Sullivan said that despite the expense of uniforms equipment 
and the time and travel most reenactors were anxious to 
participate in as many events as possible 
We are talking about salesmen bookkeepers teachers truck 
drivers doctors and lawyers all united by a common love of 
history Sullivan said 
Its like a time machine providing a feeling of history you 
cant get any other way he said 
He said many buffs both from North and South preferred to 
march as Confederates perhaps because of the romance of the Lost 
Cause 
Reenactors were used when they made the television movie 
North and South and just about everyone wanted to be a 
Confederate including most of the Yankees he said In the 
end they had to make our group go in as Union troops
