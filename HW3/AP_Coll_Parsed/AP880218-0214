The AFLCIO launched a campaign 
Thursday against what it called an attempt by Texas Air Corp to 
force a strike at Eastern Airlines and transfer its operations to 
nonunionized Texas Air subsidiaries 
The 143 millionmember federations industrial union department 
said it has established a citizens commission to hold hearings on 
a campaign of abuse against Easterns 22550 unionized workers 
and steady deterioration of service and safety standards since 
Texas Air acquired it two years ago 
Miamibased Eastern and the Machinists union representing some 
12000 Eastern mechanics baggage handlers and other ground 
personnel have been in mediation since November after declaring an 
impasse on the airlines demand for a new round of wage concessions 
In the meantime the company has attempted to spin off its 
Northeast air shuttle linking New York Washington and Boston a 
move contested in court by the union and made extensive 
preparations to continue operating in anticipation of a strike as 
early as April 1 
Eastern has steadily increased work pressures and economic 
pressures on its employees with the clear intention of forcing a 
strike AFLCIO President Lane Kirkland said Thursday 
Recruitment of strikebreakers in the midst of negotiations 
leaves no doubt that it Texas Air intends to repeat the allout 
unionbusting effort that it carried out after seizing Continental 
Airlines when it cynically exploited the bankruptcy laws to 
abrogate its union contracts Kirkland said 
Howard Samuel head of the federations industrial union 
department said the citizen panels hearings and demonstrations 
planned in Eastern hub cities Miami Atlanta Washington 
Philadelphia New York Boston Kansas City Houston and Denver 
are intended to put public pressure on Texas Airs debtholders to 
get Eastern to settle with the Machinists 
A boycott was rejected as playing right into his Texas Air 
owner Frank Lorenzos hands to destroy Eastern Airlines Samuel 
said 
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the unions public relations 
campaign will only backfire 
The intent is to cause further deterioration in Easterns 
already serious financial condition he said If such a 
selfdefeating and destructive campaign were to be successful the 
economic impact would unquestionably have a serious and detrimental 
effect on Easterns 32500 employees 
Eastern which reported a net loss of 1811 million in 1987 is 
demanding 265 million in concessions from the Machinists over the 
next two years For some that would mean wage and benefit cuts of 
up to 48 percent union officials said 
Contracts with two other unions representing the airlines 3550 
pilots and 7000 flight attendants also come up for renewal in July 
and December respectively The company last year told them it 
needs concessions totaling 185 million from the two groups 
Samuels said the citizens panel will be chaired by Eleanor 
Holmes Norton former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission and includes among its members former Labor Secretary 
W Willard Wirtz the Rev Joseph Lowry president of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference and Texas Agriculture Commissioner 
Jim Hightower
