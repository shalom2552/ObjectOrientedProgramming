Here are some highlights of President Reagans 
budget message to Congress 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
By reordering priorities so that we spend more on national 
security and less on wasteful or unnecessary federal programs we 
have made freedom more secure around the world and have been able 
to negotiate with our adversaries from a position of strength 
By pursuing marketoriented economic policies we have uncorked 
the genie of American enterprise and created new businesses more 
jobs improved production and widespread prosperity 
And we have done all this without neglecting the poor the 
elderly the infirm and the unfortunate among us 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
This budget does not fully reflect my priorities nor 
presumably those of any particular member of Congress 
But the goal of deficit reduction through spending reduction 
must be paramount 
Abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten our 
economic progress and burden future generations 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
I propose an increase of 656 million for discretionary 
programs of the Department of Education Although state and local 
governments fund most educational activity federal programs 
provide crucial aid for the poor the handicapped and the 
educationally disadvantaged 
I have proposed reform of our overcentralized welfare system 
through state experimentation with innovative alternatives 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
Ineffective programs to assist dislocated workers would be 
replaced by an expanded 1 billion worker readjustment program 
WRAP carefully designed to help those displaced from their jobs 
move quickly into new careers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
I propose a continued increase in federally supported basic 
research aimed at longerterm improvements in the nations 
productivity and global competitiveness 
I would provide 115 billion for space programs 
I also recommend 363 million in 1989 to initiate construction 
of the Superconducting Super Collider SSC including 283 million 
for construction and 60 million for supporting research and 
development 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
I continue to urge enactment of an affordable selffinancing 
insurance program through Medicare to protect families from 
economic devastation caused by catastrophic illness 
To attack the scourge of AIDS I propose 2 billion for 
additional research education and treatment in 1989 a 38 
percent increase over the 1988 level 
Building upon the nations preeminence in basic biomedical 
research I seek a 51 percent increase for nonAIDS research at 
the National Institutes of Health 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
For expanded law enforcement I propose 45 billion an 
increase of 6 percent over 1988 
For drug law enforcement prevention and treatment programs I 
propose 39 billion in 1989 a 13 percent increase over the 1988 
level

inmate population I would provide 437 million more than double 
the 202 million devoted to federal prison construction in 1988

multiyear program to modernize the nations air traffic control 
systems I would provide 16 billion a 44 percent increase over 
the level of 1988

To carry out the joint recommendations of the US and Canadian 
special envoys on acid rain I recommend total funding of 25 
billion for innovative clean coal technology demonstration projects 
over the period 1988 through 1992 
I also recommend an expansion of hazardous waste cleanup 
efforts with an increase in Superfund outlays of some 430 million 
in 1989 
To continue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR at the 
current rate of 50000 barrels per day I would provide 334 
million in 1989 Contingent upon the enactment of legislation 
authorizing the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserves NPR I would 
provide an additional 477 million to bring the fill rate up to 
100000 barrels per day 
To improve the speed and accuracy of tax processing and expand 
information services provided to taxpayers I would provide a 241 
million increase for the Internal Revenue Service 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
The proposals for national security contained in this budget 
represent an essential minimum program for keeping America safe and 
honoring our commitments to our friends and allies 
My budget requests defense funding of 2995 billion in 
budget authority and 294 billion in outlays for 1989 It also 
provides for about 2 percent real growth in these programs in 
future years 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
I plan to continue pushing for the elimination of 
artificially high farm price supports thereby reducing the need 
for export subsidies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
The budget proposes certain reforms in the Medicare program 
to limit payments for certain overpriced physician procedures 
limit payments for durable medical equipment and supplies and 
eliminate a loophole in the payment process for kidney dialysis In 
total these reforms would reduce spending for Medicare by 12 
billion from the level that would occur if current law were 
continued 
</TEXT>

The government often continues programs at the federal level 
that are no longer needed This is the case with rural housing

program and economic development programs of the Tennessee Valley 
Authority

Southeastern Power Administration and plan to study possible 
privatization of our uranium enrichment facilities as well as ways 
of making the US Postal Service more efficient through greater 
reliance on the private sector 
</TEXT>

I propose in this budget a new approach to paying federal 
employees who increase their productivity I ask the Congress to 
modify the current system of virtually automatic withingrade 
pay increases for the roughly 40 percent of employees eligible each 
year to one that is based on employee performance 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
A constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget 
and a provision requiring a supermajority vote in the Congress to 
increase taxes would impose some muchneeded discipline on the 
congressional budget process 
</TEXT>

legislation creating new federal programs to be 
deficitneutralrequiring the concurrent enactment of equal 
amounts of program reductions or revenue increases
