Government officials and businessmen 
say charges they enriched themselves on US foreign aid are false 
or misleading and were timed to embarrass Costa Rica before 
Congress voted on rebel funding 
US Embassy sources and several other businessmen say some of 
the accusations are true 
Local officials are reacting angrily to a US State Department 
memo which charges that US Embassy officials in Costa Rica 
misspent and mismanaged millions of dollars in foreign aid 
including providing college scholarships for children of 
influential citizens and creating a development agency that largely 
benefited politicians 
A Costa Rican government spokesman who agreed to be interviewed 
only on condition of anonymity said no formal response was planned 
until the memo can be clarified 
When something like this hits the public people have the 
right not only to feel angry but to feel extremely angry he said 
The memo said actions by US officials and wealthy and 
influential Costa Ricans who helped distribute the aid closely 
approach criminal conduct 
Portions of the memo first were disclosed in a story written by 
the Scripps Howard News Service and published in several US 
newspapers in late January just two weeks before Congress voted on 
an aid proposal for rebels fighting Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista 
government The Associated Press carried a lengthy story on the 
memo last week from Washington 
Congress rejected the Contra rebel proposal in early February 
But Costa Rican officials say release of the memo before the vote 
was designed to muddy the image of the country and its president 
Oscar Arias who has been an influential opponent of the Reagan 
administrations Contra policy 
Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize last fall for a Central American 
peace plan that forbids foreign funding of rebel groups in the 
region and calls for a negotiated political settlement to the 
areas conflicts 
The peace plan has at least temporarily preempted the Reagan 
administration policy of using military pressure on the Sandinistas 
The confidential memo was written Oct 9 1987 by the State 
Departments inspector general Herbert L Beckington to Alan 
Woods administrator of the Agency for International Development 
known as AID that distributes the money 
In the memo Beckington claimed the former AID director in Costa 
Rica Daniel J Chaij personally approved loans and grants that 
benefited some of the countrys most prominent business and 
political figures 
Most of the alleged activities took place before Arias was 
elected in 1986 
After the memo was first published Jan 20 Costa Ricas 
ambassador to Washington Guido Fernandez questioned why 
confidential reports supplied more than four months ago should be 
leaked to the press at this particular time 
Costa Ricas finance minister Fernando Naranjo told reporters 
that the story was a complete unmitigated lie 
Both Fernandez and Naranjo were identified as beneficiaries of 
AID programs 
Several sources in the Costa Rican government and private sector 
say they believe some of the accusations are valid 
There was some poor judgment used in how they decided some of 
these projects said one US Embassy source speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
Other officials said parts of the memo were false and written in 
inflammatory language to make legitimate activities appear illegal 
or questionable 
They said a second audit exonerated many of the people mentioned 
in the Oct 9 memo but the audit has not been released 
Jack Harris a Costa Rican business executive also named in the 
memo said some of the facts in it appear to be true but were 
mischievously distorted and given sinister and malicious 
interpretations 
Harris and others said one example is a charge that a small 
group of Costa Ricans set up a system by which they were able to 
evade local taxes on money earned from AID contracts 
They said the memo made the practice seem illegal although it 
is a legally established tax shelter system in Costa Rica 
It is not done this way in the United States but in Costa 
Rica it is Harris said Its a shelter legal decent upheld 
by law There is absolutely nothing wrong with it but the 
insinuations made in the memo are insidious 
Legislators in Costa Rica and the United States are planning 
investigations into how AID money was used in Costa Rica The Costa 
Ricans say they also will look into why the critical memo was 
leaked to the press
