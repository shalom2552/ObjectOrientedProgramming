President Mauno Koivisto was reelected 
to a second sixyear term today winning a secondround victory in 
an electoral college 
Koivisto a Social Democrat garnered 15 million votes in a 
general election two weeks ago but fell just short of the absolute 
majority he needed to be directly elected without referring the 
vote to the 301member electoral college 
Koivistos return to office was never in doubt and he planned a 
reception for 500 people at the official presidential residence 
later today to celebrate his victory 
Conservative Prime Minister Harri Holkeri who challenged 
Koivisto along with three other contenders released his delegates 
to vote freely after the first round of voting gave Koivisto 144 
ballots 7 shy of a majority 
In the second round Koivisto picked up 45 of Holkeris 
delegates for a total of 189 Opposition leader Paavo Vayrynen of 
the Center Party won 68 votes and leftist candidate Kalevi Kivistoe 
got won 26 Nineteen delegates remained loyal to Holkeri The fifth 
candidate two weeks ago Jouko Kajanoja had no electors
