The government estimates that 10000 
to 20000 homeless children roam the streets of the Ermita 
redlight district in Manila falling into lives of prostitution 
petty crime and drug addiction 
Volunteers and social workers have mobilized in an effort to 
save them 
We have street children we have all types of exploited 
children They are victims said Nenuca Ross a volunteer with 
the governments Department of Social Welfare 
Many of the children drifted into Manila from impoverished rural 
provinces 
But with few skills and no education both parents and children 
survive by begging and by selling cigarettes and smuggled watches 
Many of the children go on to prostitution pickpocketing 
shoplifting extortion and drug trafficking 
But the government and private agencies are now intensifying 
efforts to find and rehabilitate such children and break the cycle 
of crime and poverty 
We go to them Mrs Ross said We talk to them We sit on 
the sidewalks with them invite them to a hotdog sandwich or 
something 
Mrs Ross said the children are easiest to persuade on rainy 
days when business is bad or when they are apprehended by 
police 
Once they have been found children 6 to 13 years old are taken 
to the welfare departments tent schools where they receive 
counseling and the rudiments of reading and writing 
Those who have suffered serious beatings drug addiction or 
sexual abuse are taken to a halfway house in Alabang a Manila 
suburb where they receive psychiatric help Teenagers go to 
staterun juvenile institutions 
Officials say child prostitution has been a problem for years 
and President Corazon Aquino has promised to crack down on child 
prostitution and give greater priority to child welfare programs 
Rita Roque Manilas welfare department director said the 
citys two tent schools have successfully reintegrated some 100 
children since the program began last year The department plans to 
build a third school in Ermita the redlight district of seedy 
bars brothels and cheap hotels near Manila Bay 
Mrs Ross said about 800 children have been graduated over the 
past two years from the Alabang center But she added that about 
800 others escaped and returned to the streets 
Thats because they are not helped Mrs Roque said Its 
not because they really want to but there is no other way for them 
to survive Unless a helping hand comes along and helps them 
recover that is what will happen to them 
Mrs Ross said criminal syndicates work actively against welfare 
workers to prevent children from seeking help 
Ive seen some of these transactions but we cannot 
intervene she said There is a Mafia They are surrounded by 
pimps They have become hardened We cannot reform their 
personalities 
In the best of circumstances she added saving a child who may 
never have had a home can be a long painful process 
A street child does not open up to you until maybe six 
months she said You have to gain their trust first You dont 
force them to open up because they will all answer lies Theyve 
learned this from the streets But if you leave them at their own 
pace little by little they will tell you their stories They know 
they have a friend 
For 18yearold Jose a former drug addict the breakthrough 
came when he asked social workers to give him a birthday party 
Mrs Ross said that during the party Jose began to cry and 
admitted it was not his birthday 
I told him never mind thats for all the birthdays you never 
had she said He was touched From then on he said I want to 
go to school I will stop my drugs and he did stop 
The youth is now in the fourth grade and serves as older 
brother to newcomers at the Alabang center 
We are building up for the future Mrs Ross said
