A note purportedly written by the 
kidnappers of two UN relief workers said Wednesday the captives 
were linked to an intelligence agency and would be freed only if 
proven innocent of espionage 
The Swedish foreign minister disputed the allegations in the 
letter 
The note handwritten in Arabic and delivered to a Western news 
agency in Beirut said hostages Jan Stening of Sweden and William 
Jorgensen of Norway would be released only after they are proven 
innocent from the charges against them 
We announce to everybody that Swede Stening and Norwegian 
Jorgensen are involved with the secret service of a foreign country 
and this is becoming clear through investigation of them it said 
The two employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
which cares for Palestine refugees were abducted by gunmen on Feb 
5 near the south Lebanese port city of Sidon 
The relief agency blamed the abduction on Palestinians acting 
individually without political motivations or links to any 
organization Palestinian leaders have denounced the kidnappings 
The note which did not identify the kidnappers or give a date 
carried what were said to be the thumbprints and signatures of 
Stening and Jorgensen 
A similiar note said on Saturday the kidnappers were 
interrogating them but made no specific accusations against them 
We remind everybody we are not aiming at causing harm to our 
steadfast people We appreciate the services of the UN agency and 
call on them to be patient until the time comes for us to reveal 
all the information the note said 
We tell everyone who claims he is able to release them within 
a specific time or that the whereabouts of the hostages is known 
that their release will only take place when they are proved 
innocent of the charges against them the statement said 
Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson said the information in 
the letter is incorrect and false 
One reason for this is that Stening with an impeccable 
service record in both Sweden and UNWRA not could have lent 
himself to anything like that he said Secondly I think the 
kidnappers need a motive that can be accepted by those who put 
pressure on them to release the hostages Thats why they make this 
up This is a product of fantasy
