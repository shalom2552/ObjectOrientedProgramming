A Torontobased real estate company launched a 
245 million offer Tuesday for up to 14 million shares of Santa Fe 
Southern Pacific Corp adding another chapter to the complicated 
fight for control of Santa Fe 
The offer by Olympia amp York Developments Ltd which works out 
to 1750 a share would boost Olympia amp Yorks stake in Santa Fe 
to 199 percent 
Olympia amp York which had control of 105 percent of the 
railroad and natural resources company is challenging a plan by 
Henley Group Inc of La Jolla Calif to wage a proxy fight for 
control of Santa Fe 
I think Olympia amp York are trying to make sure they have a 
controlling position in the company said Isabel Benham an 
analyst at Printon Kane In New York 
Henley Group is Santa Fes largest shareholder with 157 
percent It plans to wage a proxy fight in opposition to Santa Fes 
proposed 47 billion restructuring plan which was seen as an 
effort to stop Henleys advances 
Olympia amp York supported the restructuring and its 
representatives have been nominated to two seats on the Santa Fe 
board 
Santa Fe which has about 1562 million shares outstanding said 
it has been informed of Olympia amp Yorks tender offer but had no 
comment spokesman Richard Hall said 
Norm Ritter a spokesman for Henley Group said company Chairman 
Michael Dingman was pleased with the move but he would not 
elaborate 
Under the restructuring plan Santa Fe shareholders would 
receive 25 in cash and 5 in subordinated debentures per share 
Henley has said the debentures are another effort by Santa Fe to 
prevent a takeover and is challenging them in court Ritter said a 
Delaware Chancery Court has set Feb 26 as the date for a 
preliminary hearing on the issue 
A debenture is a debt repayable within a specified time and 
bearing a fixed rate of interest which must be paid whether or not 
the company issuing it makes a profit 
The Olympia amp York offer which expires at midnight March 13 
hinges on payment by Santa Fe of a special dividend the cash part 
of which the company said it paid Tuesday with the debenture 
payment set for March 1 
Meanwhile Moodys Investors Service Inc citing the effects of 
the restructuring plan said it downgraded the securities ratings 
of Santa Fe and its subsidiaries the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe 
Railway and Southern Pacific Co 
Moodys said the downgrade was based on the substantial 
weakening in the parents debtprotection measurements because of a 
recent corporate restructuring 
About 14 billion of securities are affected 
The dividend which will result in an outlay of approximately 
39 billion will be funded primarily through proceeds from asset 
sales the senior subordinated debentures and bank debt Moodys 
said 
This outlay will substantially reduce the firms equity and 
the additional 46 billion of debt will radically increase 
leverage 
The New Yorkbased rating agency said Santa Fes ability to 
generate cash flow to meet maturing obligations depends primarily 
on an aggressive real estate divestiture program
