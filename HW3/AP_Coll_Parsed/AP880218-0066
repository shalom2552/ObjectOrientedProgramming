A powerful blast of shock waves can smash 
gallstones inside the body and may someday replace surgery for more 
than 100000 Americans each year experts say 
The procedure called lithotripsy has already become the 
standard treatment for kidney stones Research published today 
suggests it will also be useful for many people with gallstones 
which are four times more common 
Doctors in West Germany showed that the procedure is a safe 
and effective treatment in selected patients with gallstones 
Their work is the first largescale examination of the therapy for 
people with this problem 
More than 150 hospitals in the United States already have shock 
wave machines for smashing kidney stones Since its approval in 
1984 this therapy has become routine for many of the 120000 
Americans who once required kidney stone surgery each year An 
estimated 475000 Americans undergo gallstone surgery annually 
Most of us think that at least 20 percent and maybe even a 
third to half of the gallstone patients in the United States 
within three to five years could be treated by this means said 
Dr Randolph B Reinhold A significant number of people who are 
treated with surgery could be treated without surgery 
Reinhold a researcher at New England Medical Center in Boston 
is among US experts who plan to begin testing the shock wave 
machines called lithotriptors next spring 
Lithotriptors use shock waves to smash stones still inside the 
body Instead of requiring major surgery and about six weeks of 
recuperation patients are sent home within a day or two and often 
dont require general anesthesia 
The German study was conducted by Dr Michael Sackmann and 
colleagues at the University of Munich A report on their first 175 
patients was published in the New England Journal of Medicine 
Its the only really good study thats been done in the world 
and its very optimistic data by a very good group said Reinhold 
As currently set up kidney stone lithotriptors cannot be used 
to treat gallstones Kidney stones are made largely of calcium and 
the machines are equipped with Xrays to produce images of them 
But most gallstones are made of cholesterol which doesnt show up 
on Xrays So gallstone lithotriptors use ultrasound to make their 
pictures 
Lithotriptors designed to smash gallstones are being installed 
in 10 US hospitals for experimental use 
In the German study only about a quarter of all gallstone 
patients were allowed to try the treatment Many were excluded 
because they had more than three stones or especially large ones 
The treatment pulverized their gallstones leaving only a trace 
of fine sand or sludge The patients took bile acid drugs for three 
months to dissolve the debris Within a year or so this residue 
was gone completely in more than 90 percent of the patients 
The therapy failed to break up a stone in just one case That 
patient was the only one of the 175 who required surgery 
Lithotriptors like that used in West Germany cost 12 million 
or more 
Gallbladder surgery typically costs between 6000 and 7000 
Reinhold said that initially patients treated with lithotripsy 
will be kept in the hospital for two days and their treatment will 
cost 4000 to 5000 However this price will probably go down as 
doctors gain experience and begin sending patients home a few hours 
after the procedure
