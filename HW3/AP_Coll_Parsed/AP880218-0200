Israel and Egypt are slated to receive a 
combined total of 53 billion in economic and military aid 
commitments in fiscal 1989 out of a global total of 143 billion 
the State Department said Thursday 
Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead told a news briefing 
that even though the request to Congress for spending authority on 
foreign assistance is up about 200 million from the 1988 
allocation many pressing needs will remain unmet 
It is difficult to operate a foreign policy with such limited 
funds Whitehead said noting that the overall international 
affairs budget has dropped by some 30 per cent since 1985 
Israel and Egypt have been given the highest priority in the 
foreign assistance allocations for years and 1989 will be no 
exception Israel is scheduled to receive commitments for 12 
billion in economic aid and 18 billion in military aid while the 
figures for Egypt are 815 million and 13 billion respectively 
The 143 billion proposed by the administration would not 
represent actual 1989 outlays because some of the money will be 
spent on projects extending over several years The outlay figure 
is expected to be several billion less than the 143 billion 
request 
A US official said that of the 13 billion in military aid 
proposed for Egypt only a few million would actually be spent next 
year and the remainder would be in the pipeline for use in future 
years The same holds true for the economic aid program although 
the percentage of cash outlays are somewhat higher compared with 
the military program for Egypt 
Meanwhile the more than 40 aid recipients in subSaharan Africa 
the worlds poorest region are due to receive a combined total 
of 733 million in economic assistance commitments 
Whitehead said the high assistance levels for Israel and Egypt 
are based on need their decision to make peace a decade ago and 
the wishes of the Congress 
There is very little sympathy in Congress for a reduction 
Whitehead said 
He noted that unlike past years the global totals are likely 
to receive congressional approval because they had been agreed to 
by the congressional leadership late last year 
In the past however Congress has earmarked specific amounts 
for countries it favors forcing the administraion to make 
adjustments in the figures for other countries 
The administration has strongly opposed congressional 
earmarkings and Whitehead expressed hope that lawmakers will 
exercise restraint when they take up the 1989 proposals 
Firm earmarkings are not a good way to run a railroad 
Whitehead said 
Among the few surprises in the proposed countrybycountry 
allocations was the elimination of the program for Ireland which 
is receiving 35 million in commitments during the current year 
Whitehead said the decision to drop Ireland from the list was 
based on the perception that the United States does not receive a 
real return on its investment 
Irish diplomatic sources expressed hope that Congress will 
reinstate the funding 
For the past three years US aid to Ireland has been funneled 
through the International Fund for Ireland in which several 
countries make contributions The bulk of the funds have gone for 
the reconstruction of Northern Ireland with a small amount 
earmarked for border counties in the Irish Republic 
The fund was set up in 1986 for a threeyear period but the 
Irish sources insisting on anonymity said a fourth year of 
allocations had not been ruled out 
We understand the view of the State Department that they dont 
envisage funding beyond the third year but the matter has to be 
considered by Congress where there is strong support for the 
International Fund an Irish diplomat said 
The foreign assistance program also 
Calls for a 98 million increase in commitments for Turkey to 
6235 million Greece Turkeys principal rival would receive a 
7 million increase 
Reinstates military grant assistance to eight Latin American 
countries which have been cut out of the 1988 program All told 
Latin American countries would receive 90 million more in economic 
assistance commitments and 55 million more in military assistance 
commitments than they have at present 
Earmarks 324 million in assistance commitments almost all 
economic to Haiti even though aid to that country was suspended 
late last year when the military abrogated election laws Whitehead 
said the proposed aid to Haiti would be allocated only if there is 
progress toward democracy
