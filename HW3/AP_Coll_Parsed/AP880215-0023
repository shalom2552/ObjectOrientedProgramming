Researchers have identified a gene in fruit flies 
that is essential to the working of the biological clock that 
governs a wide range of bodily processes in humans and animals 
The gene is associated with the generation or maintenance of the 
daily or circadian rhythms that presumably evolved to help 
animals and humans cope with night and day said Michael Rosbash a 
biologist at Brandeis University in Waltham Mass He spoke Sunday 
at the annual meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science 
In addition to controlling the length or period of the daily 
cycle the gene called the period gene also governs minutelong 
fluctuations in the courtship song of the fruit fly Rosbash said 
The gene is involved not only in the length of the rhythms but 
also seems to carry instructions regarding such things as the 
extent of activity during active periods of the cycle Rosbash said 
Circadian rhythms are a pervasive feature of human and animal 
life They govern fundamental measures such as body temperature and 
hormonal secretions and many other more subtle physical and mental 
factors 
Researchers do not yet know how the period gene works That 
question is being studied intensively by Rosbash and Jeffrey Hall 
and their colleagues at Brandeis and by Michael Young and 
associates at Rockefeller University in New York City 
Rosbash said the period gene presumably triggers the production 
of a protein That protein might be part of the clock mechanism 
something that researchers know nothing about 
Or it could be the readout of the clock something like the 
hands on a wristwatch which give you the information that was 
generated in the clock mechanism Rosbash said 
A third possibility is that the period gene protein somehow 
controls the genes or proteins that form the clock mechanism 
turning them on or off for example 
The two research teams are now working intensively to isolate 
the protein produced by the period gene and determine its function 
Rosbash said 
Among the curious features of the gene that they have identified 
is a string of 25 pairs of coding units in the genes genetic 
message which encodes proteins 
This feature is highly unusual but it occurs in only one of 
three species of fruit flies tested And when it is removed the 
gene appears to function well without it The perfect repeat of 
25 pairs appears not to be necessary Rosbash said 
When the entire gene is removed from a fruit fly the fly loses 
its circadian rhythms but it is otherwise perfectly normal he 
said 
Certain mutants of the period gene give flies a circadian rhythm 
shorter than 24 hours Rosbash said Those genes also reduce the 
60second cycling in the males fruit flys courtship song Rosbash 
said 
He has also found that the gene appears to be turned on in fruit 
fly embryos and adults but not in the larval or pupal stages in 
the flys life cycle that occur in between
