An arsonist who burned the towns elementary 
school and damaged a church that opened its doors to students may 
have set a fire Monday that destroyed another church and its 
classrooms authorities said 
Omak a central Washington town of 4000 that boasts Okanogan 
Countys only stoplight has been terrorized by the arson spree 
Its affected everyone in town People are very very grim 
said Mary Koch managing editor of the weekly Omak Chronicle 
They were somber as they drove by it going to work this morning 
It was still burning 
The North Omak Elementary School was heavily damaged in a 
January fire its second in two months In the past two weeks two 
churches and a church parsonage have been set afire 
Theyre a kook someone who is unbalanced said Vic 
Power superintendent of Omaks school district 
School officials have checked through their records for any 
former employee or student who has a grudge but have turned up 
nothing he said 
One of the interesting things in Omak is we havent had any 
particular problems with people havent had anyone out there we 
could identify who had been on our case for any particular 
reason Power said 
Police Chief Peter Sirois said police are looking at two or 
three persons of interest at this point Police have 
interviewed about a dozen people so far he said He declined to 
say why the persons of interest might have wanted to harm the 
schools or churches 
Firefighters on Monday extinguished the latest fire which 
destroyed the 15 million Omak Presbyterian Church The church and 
the Free Methodist Church had served as temporary classrooms after 
the fire at the elementary school which served students in 
kindergarten though second grade 
Last week the Methodist church sustained about 200000 in 
damage A fire set there Saturday and at the parsonage next door on 
Sunday caused an additional 30000 in damage said Mike Cramer 
assistant chief of the eightperson Omak police force 
Its got everybody on the edge said pastor Elbert G 
Harlow who lives across the street from his Presbyterian Church 
Theyre nervous waiting to see whats going to happen next 
Church officials met Sunday night and made sure all doors and 
windows were locked Harlow said A security guard woke him Monday 
with news of the fire 
The blzae apparently was set by someone who broke into the 
basement through a window hidden by two evergreen trees beside the 
threestory redbrick church Omak Fire Chief Cal Bowling said 
But Bowling said hed rather not discuss the investigation with 
reporters 
Whoever set these fires is going to read your report and Id 
just hate to let him know what this has done to the community 
Bowling said 
The latest fire was too hot Monday for the fire marshal to 
determine what caused it Cramer said 
We have a strong feeling but we cant draw any conclusions 
yet he said Authorities hope to determine the cause by Tuesday 
But there was no doubt that an arsonist had set the earlier 
fires Cramer said 
The fires are beginning to take a psychological toll on 
residents and on the 1800 students including 450 from North Omak 
Elementary Cramer said 
Its having a bad effect on everybody When the first fire hit 
the school it devastated the kids It was tough for them to move 
Now theyre going to have to again he said 
Electricians and plumbers helped set up temporary buildings as 
classrooms said Cramer who added that nighttime patrols have been 
expanded with the help of the Okanogan Sheriffs Department 
It only seems to happen while Omak sleeps Cramer said In 
a way thats good because the buildings are empty and so far no 
one has been hurt 
The Rev Norman Lund pastor of Foursquare Gospel Church which 
also housed North Elementary students said he doesnt want to 
guess what the arsonist is thinking 
I think everyones concerned about saying anything he said 
You dont want to motivate the person
