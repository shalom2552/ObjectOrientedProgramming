The robbery and assault convictions of 
WaiChiu Tony Ng the last of the defendants in the 1983 massacre 
of 13 people in a Chinatown gambling parlor were upheld today by 
Washingtons Supreme Court 
The leader of the robberykillings at Seattles Wah Mee Club 
Kwan Fai Willie Mak is facing the death penalty and Benjamin Kin 
Ng was sentenced to life without possibility of parole in the 
killings the deadliest mass murder in state history 
The court was unanimous in upholding the 13 robbery counts and a 
single seconddegree assault count against Ng no relation to 
Benjamin Ng He faces seven consecutive life terms for seven of the 
robberies with the six remaining robbery counts and the 10year 
assault sentences running concurrently with the life terms 
Tony Ng was charged with felony murder in all 13 deaths but the 
prosecution did not seek the death penalty He consistently denied 
he killed any of the victims and claimed he was forced by Mak under 
threat of death to participate in the robbery 
He was convicted in King County Superior Court in 1985 of the 
lesser charges 
Twelve of the 13 victims at the Wah Mee Club were tied and shot 
in the head executionstyle to leave no witnesses One victim Wai 
Yok Chin survived critical gunshot wounds to identify the 
assailants 
Mak and Benjamin Ng were arrested and tried separately Tony Ng 
whose family moved to Seattle from Hong Kong when he was a youth 
escaped He was arrested for immigration violations about 18 months 
later in Calgary Canada He gave a confession to Canadian and 
Seattle police officers 
Tony Ng sought reversal of his convictions contending that his 
Canadian confession was wrongly admitted at trial He also 
contended his convictions are inconsistent with his acquittal on 
the murder charges 
But the court in an opinion by Justice Robert F Brachtenbach 
rejected both contentions 
The court said that Tony Ngs confession was voluntary and if it 
was incorrectly admitted the action was harmless because there was 
ample other evidence 
Where the jurys verdict is supported by sufficient evidence 
from which it could rationally find the defendant guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt we will not reverse on grounds the guilty verdict 
is inconsistent with acquittal on another count the court said
