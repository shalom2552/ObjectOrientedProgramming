Caspar Weinberger the former defense 
secretary questioned Tuesday whether fundamental policy changes 
are taking place in the Soviet Union and whether Mikhail Gorbachev 
can keep his post as top leader 
I think we have to be very careful if we assume there are 
major policy changes Weinberger said I dont know how 
firmly seated is the present regime I dont think any of us really 
know that 
Im not sure anybody would be allowed to be general secretary 
of the Communist party of the Soviet Union who is very different 
from the past Weinberger told the Washington Foreign 
Correspondents Association 
Soviet forces in Afghanistan suggest that things are not all 
that changed in the Soviet Union Weinberger said I dont see 
any change in world domination as their goal 
It should take two weeks or four at the outside for the 
Soviets to withdraw troops from Afghanistan he said despite their 
current talk of a 10month timetable 
The sincerity of Gorbachevs offer can only be judged when 
withdrawal is complete when theyve left and the Afghan 
people can have the kind of government they want he said 
Weinberger who was succeeded by Defense Secetary Frank Carlucci 
late last year described as surface changes the new look at 
the Kremlin Gorbachev smiles from time to time he wears much 
better clothes and hes younger and apparently in better health 
than past leaders he said 
The principal change I see in the Soviet Union is that they 
are now actively courting world public opinion campaigning for a 
favorable world press and this is so new and so novel that they are 
getting it he said
