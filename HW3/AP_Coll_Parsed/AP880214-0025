The military said Sunday it sent 
4000 troops to protect voters in the southern island province of 
Sulu the last area to vote in the Philippines violencemarred 
regional elections 
The islands 214000 voters are to choose three governors 18 
mayors and 126 members of town councils Monday in the final stage 
of balloting that began four weeks ago 
About 50 Moslem bandits Friday attacked the southern island town 
of Maimbun about 600 miles south of Manila said Col Romeo 
Abendan head of the Philippine Constabulary of Sulu 
He said four people were killed three of them members of the 
Moslem rebel Moro National Liberation Front 
On Saturday bandits attacked Kulasi village just outside 
Maimbung but no casualties were reported he said In nearby Luuk 
rival political groups traded fire with automatic weapons but 
there were no reported fatalities he said 
Col Anthony Elias said 4000 marine and army troops have joined 
constabulary and special forces to prevent violence during voting 
in the largely Moslem province and Moro stronghold 
We expect some disturbance after the voting which is normal 
especially when trends begin to show Elias told reporters 
Most Filipinos voted Jan 18 in an election that President 
Corazon Aquino said restored full democracy nearly two years after 
the ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos But voting was postponed 
in 11 of the 73 provinces because of fears of violence from 
communist rebels and regional warlords 
In Manila Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Saturday that his 
department was studying proposals to assist the military against 
the 24000member communist New Peoples Army 
Ramos did not specify what measures were under review but he 
previously has called for restoring the death penalty for rebels 
Ramos also has proposed an unspecified package of legal 
weapons to enable the military to crush the 19year insurgency 
Such calls have led to speculation that the government was 
considering a limited state of emergency in some provinces 
Mrs Aquino told reporters Friday she would await 
recommendations from Ramos before deciding whether to impose 
emergency measures 
Human rights groups have denounced such proposals Marcos 
imposed martial law from 1972 to 1981 and said it was to prevent a 
communist takeover The move helped fuel opposition to the 
administration that culminated in the February 1986 uprising that 
toppled Marcos
