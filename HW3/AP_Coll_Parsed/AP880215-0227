EDITORS NOTE The traditional 27piece brass band so common in 
Europe almost faded from the American scene after World War II But 
since a Pittsburgh conductor formed the River City Brass Band eight 
years ago the brass sound has been on the rebound

Call it the Boston Pops in brass or the common 
mans symphony But please says conductor Robert Bernat dont 
call it oompah 
The bright upbeat music of the 27piece Britishstyle River 
City Brass Band is leading a modest grassroots revival of a 
tradition that peaked at the turn of the century 
Its just a great big juicy fat sound Bernat says 
The conductor says people are surprised the band plays popular 
and contemporary songs classics and folk tunes not just marches 
and what he calls oompah 
When they think of brass bands oompah is what people usually 
think of he says Thats German beer garden music 
leedeedeeduhoompahpah And we do that sometimes 
River City features two percussionists and 25 brass horns 
including 10 cornets four tubas three trombones three horns two 
euphoniums a recent soldout performance at a suburban Pittsburgh middle 
school the band played music written by John Philip Sousa Scott 
Joplin and George Gershwin The audience chose Sousas The 
Thunderer for the encore clapping loudly with the march tapping 
their feet and rocking in their seats 
Theres a certain type of march that when you play the 
audience goes mad Bernat says The audiences reaction is 
predictable 
Most shows also feature a singalong 
They come to our concert and they just let it go says 
Bernard Black solo cornet player They can sit there and stamp 
their feet and clap their hands and whistle Ive never heard that 
many people 1500 people in church singing together something 
like Let Me Call You Sweetheart 
Bob turns around and conducts them like the Boston Pops he 
says 
It just sort of puts you on a high says concert fan Frances 
McBriar The music is so exciting Its so American You connect 
bands with parades I love a parade and thats what brass bands 
remind me of 
River Citys subscribers have grown from about 85 in 1981 to 
more than 2600 this season and the band is debtfree for the first 
time says General Manager Joan Kimmel 
But popular appeal has come sooner than critical acclaim The 
Pennsylvania Council of The Arts for example has limited its 
funding of River City because it does not consider brass band music 
a form of art 
Band music is an entertainment form says Christine Voigt 
music director for the council Its in the context that band 
music is meant for parks and orchestral music is fine art and meant 
for a different audience 
Droste says the main difference is that a brass band appeals to 
everyone and plays a greater variety of music 
Its a very eclectic mix and though its a grassroots 
movement the standards are very high he says We appeal to 
the common man the man in the street 
It would be very difficult to find a better band than the 
River City Brass Band They would compare very favorably with the 
top brass bands in England where they have the best brass bands in 
the world 
Carl Jackson a freelance musician who has played trombone with 
the band for about five years says he underestimated the brass 
band 
When I got the announcement of the brass band tryouts I said 
Come on you cant be serious he says Ive learned its a 
very serious thing 
Bernat says a significant stamp of approval came when the 
band recently was chosen to perform in 11 Australian cities in 
March during the 1988 Australian bicentennial celebration along 
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra the Mormon Tabernacle Choir 
the Texas Boys Choir and Twyla Tharp Dance Company 
At home River City performs a 28concert subscription series in 
Pittsburghs lavish Carnegie Hall and in an old movie theater and 
two suburban schools It has toured about 15 states 
We get out to the audience rather than trying to get the 
audience to come out to us Kimmel says It has that whole 
Music Man feeling that they can have this right here in river 
city 
Kimmel said all kinds of people attend concerts But at the 
citys Carnegie Hall its fur coats and CEOs and the kind of 
people you see at the symphony
