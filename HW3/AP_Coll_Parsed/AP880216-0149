Police hunted Tuesday for four men who 
burst into a recording studio wielding machine guns and ordered 
about 40 partygoers to strip before robbing them 
Witnesses said the bandits were looking for Twin Cities vocalist 
Alexander ONeal who recently topped the black music charts with 
Fake But ONeal was not at the party which followed a concert 
by him in Minneapolis when the men burst into the small studio in 
the basement of a St Paul beauty salon 
Joseph Karriem a victim and the son of the salon owner said 
the robbers appeared to be under the mistaken impression that 
members of ONeals band had brought with them a significant amount 
of money earned from the concert 
They came ready to rob Fort Knox Karriem said 
They were looking for the money from the Orpheum said 
Karriems mother Tommie They came in here looking for Alexander 
ONeal 
Police had no suspects Lt Robert Anderson head of the St 
Paul police robbery unit said Tuesday 
However Anderson said investigators believe none of the money 
stolen was concert proceeds The total value of goods and cash 
stolen has yet to be compiled he added 
According to Ms Karriem the men who broke up the party at 4 
am Monday forced some guests to strip to their underwear and 
others to strip completely 
We were all deathly afraid said Ms Karriem These were 
terrorists They made us lay on top of each other naked in the 
corner and pointed the machine guns at our heads They told us what 
they were Thompsons and Uzis 
Anytime anyone would look up from the floor the robbers would 
threaten to shoot police Sgt Michael Schwab said Monday They 
took everything jewelry wallets keys coats 
ONeals bass player Rocky Garrity walked in during the middle 
of the robbery and was beaten with a gun until he went into 
convulsions said Ms Karriem Garrity was treated at St 
PaulRamsey Medical Center and released authorities said 
Joseph Karriem said the bandits had plenty of time to leave 
but they wanted to torment us They were even talking about 
wasting the police 
Ive never seen anything like this in St Paul or 
Minneapolis 
Karriem said he believes the partygoers were set up by someone 
who knew about the celebration 
Witnesses said the gunmen left a message for ONeal 34 who 
went to Houston after the concert Monday 
They told us to tell Alex that their children didnt have 
nothing for Christmas but they had something now Karriem said
