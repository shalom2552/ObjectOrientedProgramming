You sensed it was over when Ted Williams and 
Barry Goldwater stepped into the batters box 
New Hampshire which derailed George Bushs Big Mo in 1980 
delivered for him in Tuesdays Republican presidential primary The 
results dealt a serious setback to Bob Dole but considerable 
damage was also done to three fellows named Robertson Kemp and du 
Pont 
For as long and Bush and Dole continue their duel the chances 
pale for one of the conservative challengers to make a serious run 
for the nomination The alsorans Pete du Pont Jack Kemp and Pat 
Robertson finished in a clump in New Hampshire meaning none 
could claim victory even in the subcontest for secondtier 
momentum 
For one of the three to challenge Bush or Dole he needed a 
clear shot as the campaign moved into the South Now it seems 
certain that the spotlight will stay on the frontrunners with at 
least a tad interest in how Robertson will do in the Bible Belt 
Pete Teeley Bushs spokesman said New Hampshire Republicans 
chose Bush because of his leadership and because of his economic 
proposals and because he was a candidate with 20 years foreign 
policy experience as opposed to Dole who had served only in 
Congress 
Bush had a different explanation one based on personal history 
He did what I did in 1980 he said of Dole He won in Iowa 
and came in and talked about momentum I did what President Reagan 
did He Reagan came in and started talking the issues and I 
think its working 
Dole complained as losers generally do that his views had been 
distorted an indication that issues he cited oil import fees and 
taxes rubbed the wrong way for Dole in the conservative Granite 
State 
The memory may linger of du Pont waving a piece of paper in 
Doles face and challenging him to sign the pledge that is 
the pledge not to raise taxes no matter what 
That was Sunday night On Monday things got worse for Dole And 
better for Bush 
In his darkest hour with his lead in the polls squeezed to just 
about nothing and many of the pundits laughing behind his back 
Bush brought out the best hitter in the history of New England 
baseball and the fellow the Republicans call Mr Conservative 
Ted Williams posed for pictures with Bush and Goldwater the 
retired senator from Arizona and 1964 GOP standardbearer stumped 
by his side and cut a memorable televised campaign ad He said of 
Bush Hes the man to continue the conservative revolution we 
started 24 years ago 
In the ad broadcast as a hefty percentage of Republican voters 
were making up their minds Bush said I sense a rising tide 
with your help it will carry me to the White House 
This is the sort of thing that Bush needed not only to blunt 
Dole in his bid for a knockout punch but also to keep Robertson 
Kemp and du Pont at bay 
They or at least those who survived figured to make their move 
in the South and would have liked a clear shot at the winner of the 
BushDole duel But with Goldwater putting his conservative arms 
around Bushs shoulders and with Bush newly invigorated for his 
battle with Dole there is suddenly less room in the inn for Kemp 
du Pont or Robertson 
Dole was clearly disconsolate Tuesday night 
Early in the evening with the votes being counted Dole said 
If it hadnt been for the distortion of my positions on tax 
increases and an oil import fee Id be 10 points ahead The vice 
president portrayed Dole all last week as an advocate of an oil 
import fee and likely to cave in to pressures for a tax increase 
Its unfortunate said Dole that the vice president of 
the United States who knows better would sink to that level But 
he did it he knows its false on its face and hell have an 
opportunity to answer to that from now on
