Israel imposed tough rules on the occupied 
territories Thursday that are intended to cripple the Palestinians 
economically unless they stop strikes witholding of taxes and 
other acts of civil disobedience 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he would not trade 
concessions for an end to 10 weeks of riots in the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip Those who incite and resort to violence 
should not come away with any reward he said 
An economic boycott of Israel has become a growing 
accompaniement to the violence in the occupied lands 
Israels new restrictions are designed to hinder the flow of PLO 
funds into the territories and requiring merchants to prove they 
have paid taxes could curtail the daily trade in produce and other 
goods across the Allenby Bridge between the West Bank and Jordan 
Arrests were reported Thursday but no casualties in 
confrontations between soldiers and protesters in the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip where UN officials say 55 Arabs have been 
killed in the violence that began Dec 8 
News photographers saw a Jewish settler fire shots into the air 
at the Dheishe refugee camp to disperse stonethrowing young 
Palestinians and protests were reported in Arab neighborhoods of 
Jerusalem 
Soldiers arrested 21 Arabs suspected of inciting and 
participating in riots in Burka a West Bank village Israel radio 
said The military confirmed arrests were made but said disclosing 
the number would violate policy 
Jerusalem police plan an operation involving 1500 officers 
some brought in from West Bank towns who will perform 
roundtheclock guard duty in Arab neighborhoods starting Sunday 
the radio said 
It said police also would arrest suspected ringleaders in an 
effort to curb disturbances that are expected later this month when 
Secretary of State George P Shultz visits Israel City spokesman 
Rafi Devara confirmed the report 
Increasing numbers of the 15 million Palestinians in the West 
Bank and Gaza have adopted passive resistance to oppose Israeli 
occupation which began when the territories were captured from 
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war 
Leaflets and radio broadcasts urge them not to pay taxes to the 
Jewish state work for Israelis or buy Israelimade goods 
Only about half the 105000 Palestinians who worked in Israel 
before Dec 8 now do so Only a small percentage of Palestinians 
have paid taxes so far this year according to the Arabrun 
Palestine Press Service and such Israeli sources as the armys 
information center 
Militants put pressure on Palestinians to keep up the boycott A 
teenager stabbed a fellow Arab in the face Thursday apparently 
because he drove Palestinians to work in Israel Israel radio said 
If the trend continues and takes root it will become a 
serious problem said a senior official in the military 
government that administers the territories 
He said the new financial restrictions require Palestinians to 
prove they have paid their taxes before they can travel abroad or 
import or export goods and also must register when they bring 
1000 or more into the country The previous limit was 5000 
The limitation on money is intended to make it difficult for the 
Palestine Liberation Organization to support Arabs who stay away 
from their jobs 
Restrictions on imports and exports could have a serious effect 
on the daily trade with Jordan on which Palestinians in the West 
Bank are heavily dependent 
We hope this combined with other measures will help quell 
the disturbances said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity The people have to decide who they should be more 
afraid of the Israelis or the Arab inciters 
Mubarak Awad ArabAmerican director of the Palestinian Center 
for NonViolence said the new restrictions would not quash growing 
support for peaceful resistance 
What we are going to do is hide our income so we wont have to 
pay taxes on it he told The Associated Press We will urge 
people to pay cash instead of checks and not to use money changers 
or banks 
Although the government cancelled Awads residency permit 
because of his calls for nonviolent resistance he has not been 
expelled His US address is Wapakoneta Ohio 
The Israeli official said Arabs hurt themselves by refusing to 
pay taxes 
We raised about 114 million in taxes from the Palestinians in 
1987 and that money goes back into the Arab towns to maintain a 
good quality of life he said 
Israel collects taxes on property and business and personal 
income There also are import duties a sales tax and stamp taxes 
on documents 
Discord between Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres his 
partner and rival in the coalition government has been growing 
Peres leader of the centerleft Labor Party said Shamirs 
rightwing Likud bloc had not produced a single peace initiative 
that paves the way for negotiations to resolve the confict 
between us and the Arabs 
Shamir said in a speech to the Jewish Agencys board of 
governors that Israel should not move too quickly to give the 
Palestinians new rights 
There is a need for a considerable period of coexistence 
between us and the Palestinian Arab authorities before the question 
of sovereignty can be approached he said adding the comment 
about rewarding violence 
The US initiative Shultz will pursue is said to call for 
Palestinians to elect new leaders with whom Israel would negotiate 
a plan for selfrule
