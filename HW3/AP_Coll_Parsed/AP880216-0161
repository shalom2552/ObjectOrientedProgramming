Israels deputy chief of staff said Tuesday 
some soldiers had committed totally unacceptable acts against 
Palestinians and hospital officials reported eight Arabs wounded 
by troops in the West Bank 
Maj Gen Ehud Barak also said more than 200 Israelis had been 
injured most of them lightly since Arab riots began Dec 8 in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip He said 53 Palestinians had been 
killed but the United Nations puts the number at 54 
Barak and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin confirmed that some 
soldiers used a bulldozer to bury four Palestinians alive near 
Nablus in the West Bank The general declared This pattern of 
behavior is totally unacceptable under the standards of the 
Israeli Defense Forces and any civilized norms Whoever is found 
responsible for this event will be punished 
Neighbors rescued the four Arabs shortly after they were buried 
Young Palestinians set fire to a bus Tuesday burned tires and 
built road blocks in the occupied territories and Arab east 
Jerusalem where a general strike virtually closed down Arab 
communities and neighborhoods 
Riot police stopped a bus carrying Israeli Arab high school 
students from school in Haifa to their homes in Umm al Fahm and 
beat several of them the daily newspaper Al Hamishmar reported 
An official at Umm al Fahm confirmed the report to The 
Associated Press Police declined comment 
Transport Minister Chaim Corfu appeared to suggest Israel bombed 
a ferry that was to carry Arab deportees from a Cyprus port to 
Israel If the Palestine Liberation Organization obtained another 
vessel he said Its fate will be the same 
We knew we wouldnt allow the boat to reach Israel he said 
on Israel radio If we could prevent its departure that was 
obviously the right thing to do 
In the West Bank a soldier punched and shoved an Israeli 
cameraman working for NBC News 
The soldier said he asked the cameraman Ofir Moradov to stop 
filming a protest but NBC correspondent Martin Fletcher said 
Moradov did not hear the request The army said the soldier was 
convicted of unbecoming conduct but would not reveal his name 
or the sentence 
Barak said soldiers had not choice but to use beatings in an 
attempt to curb the riots 
Whatever amount of force is needed is something that in my 
judgment is forced upon us by the situation he told a news 
conference of foreign reporters 
We cant easily put the realities of life into a simple set of 
orders The situation created during the control of a violent riot 
is much more complicated than it might seem 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on a visit to Italy We 
want to put an end to the riots and restore normal life On the 
other hand we dont want to kill people I hope in the near 
weeks we will find the most right methods 
We have to handle it in the most human limitations he said 
addressing a news conference in English We have to defend 
ourselves and at the same time continue our efforts for finding 
peace 
Rabin questioned about the beating policy during debate in 
Parliament said the orders to use force were necessary and to 
the best of my knowledge and judgment are legal 
He said the burial of the Arabs at Nablus will be treated with 
the full heaviness of the law Its not imaginable that such an 
incident would happen in the Israeli army 
Barak said the army is succeeding in gradually improving the 
caliber of behavior of our forces but added We are 
confronting a new type of threat We cannot afford to yield to it 
and we are not going to 
He said protesters are led by a nucleus of activists who enjoy 
the support and cooperation of the masses 
The organization is on the local sometimes regional level 
he said and the core consists of two or three thousand 
relatively young people 
The general who directed military intelligence in 198386 said 
he sees no quick end to the disturbances He attributed the riots 
to decades of frustration on the personal economic and political 
levels not outside incitement 
Five people were wounded by gunfire and 12 injured by rubber 
bullets or beatings at the Fawwar refugee camp where about 4000 
Palestinians live near Hebron in the West Bank said officials at 
Hebrons Alia hospital One described the wounds as moderate to 
light 
Israel radio said a riot started Tuesday evening and residents 
stoned Israeli soldiers who fired several shots and wounded one 
protester The military command said it was checking the reports 
In Kabatiyeh a West Bank village 35 miles north of Jerusalem 
soldiers opened fire to disperse protesters and wounded two young 
Arabs in the legs the Arabrun Palestine Press Service reported 
It said another Palestinian was wounded during a protest in nearby 
Jenin 
Doctors at Jenin hospital confirmed treating three men for 
gunshot wounds
