Americans have never been healthier but they feel 
worse and worse a doctor says 
Dr Arthur J Barsky calls this the paradox of health The 
nations collective health has improved dramatically over the past 
30 years yet people report increasingly high rates of disability 
and a general dissatisfaction with their health 
Barsky a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital blames 
this on several factors including peoples obsession with diet and 
exercise and their unrealistic expectations of what medicine can do 
for them 
Writing in Thursdays New England Journal of Medicine Barsky 
noted that the life expectancy of a child born in 1984 was 75 
years In 1900 it was 47 Since 1970 alone the life expectancy 
has increased by four years 
However surveys show that people report twice as many episodes 
of disabling illness now than they did in the 1920s before the 
introduction of antibiotics In the 1970s 61 percent of Americans 
said they were satisfied with their health A decade later this 
had fallen to 55 percent 
Our subjective feeling of healthiness and physical wellbeing 
has decreased even though there have been major advances in our 
actual objective health status Barsky wrote 
One reason is medicines conquest of diseases that kill quickly 
It lets people grow old so they die with diseases that linger 
People who are saved from pneumonia and tuberculosis live long 
enough to be afflicted with arthritis and diabetes 
Thus we live longer but a greater proportion of our life is 
spent in ill health he wrote 
Among other factors cited by Barsky 
Peoples fascination with diet exercise and healthy living 
means they spend more time thinking about their bodies This erodes 
their sense of wellbeing because they are more negative about 
their health when they dwell on it 
The proliferation of doityourself diagnostic kits health 
magazines fat farms and other health products makes people more 
conscious of trivial symptoms Every twinge and ache becomes the 
sign of a horrifying disease This along with news media 
exaggeration of such rare health problems as toxic shock syndrome 
induces a cultural climate of alarm and hypochondria undermining 
feelings of wellbeing 
People go to the doctor twice as often as they did 50 years 
ago Frequently they seek help for such minor complaints as sore 
muscles colds and upset stomaches This medicalization of daily 
life leads people to think that all of their discomforts are 
curable and they are disappointed when they are not
