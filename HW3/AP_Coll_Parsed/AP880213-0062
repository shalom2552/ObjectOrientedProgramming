Carnival when practically the 
whole of Brazil puts its worries aside and parties roundtheclock 
for four straight days struts and sways to a start today 
The festival ends on Ash Wednesday Feb 17 when Brazilians can 
begin pondering again the nations huge foreign debt and corruption 
scandals in the suitable bleakness of Lent 
For now however party is the word 
Carnival is an escape valve said Roberto Couri president 
of Rios Monte Libano Club a main center of celebration It 
doesnt matter what troubles there may be When Carnival comes 
Brazilians plunge right in 
Carnival seems to have been made for Brazilians and they began 
working up to it well in advance So many people had their minds on 
Carnival this week that it was difficult to transact business with 
either private companies or the government 
Not even a strike that began Friday by the nations two largest 
airlines Varig and Vasp would stop the party Flight crews walked 
off the job and said they would strike until Sunday tying up most 
domestic and some international flights 
In Brasilia the normally sedate inland capital a prefestival 
highlight was a barathon 
Contestants ran about 3 miles and the winner was the person 
who swilled the most beer from an accompanying tank truck not the 
one who finished first 
In Rio the hub of Carnival noisy block parties punctured the 
week and the first balls were held in a series that continues 
through the celebration 
The dances which attract thousands of revelers and last all 
night range from the sophisticated Champagne Ball to the earthy 
BumBum Ball 
One of the most popular events is Rios samba school parade 
scheduled for Sunday and Monday nights in the sambadrome six 
blocks of openair concrete bleachers near downtown 
Competing will be the citys 16 best samba schools which serve 
as neighborhood social clubs 
Each school puts 40006000 brilliantly costumed people on the 
route in a spectacle that lasts for about 16 hours each day 
Most participants dressed as kings princesses Amazon 
chieftains Greek gods and maharajas toil the rest of the year at 
nondescript jobs that often pay the minimum wage of 60 a month 
When it began the samba school parade was an informal folk 
event Now it is big business 
This year the Samba School League formed in 1985 to protect the 
clubs interests sold exclusive television rights for the parades 
for a reported 1 million to the commercial network TV Globo 
Samba parade tickets for foreign tourists were jacked up this 
year to as much as 238 each payable in US dollars 
Many local travel agents refused to distribute them at such 
prices 
The president of the Samba School League a burly man known only 
as Captain Guimaraes said on television In the past samba 
schools were exploited yet they were the ones who created the 
entire show Yes were after more money to protect the 
traditional values of samba 
Many Carnival tourists are among the estimated 30000 to 40000 
people who will be affected by the strike of Varig and Vasp flight 
crews the airlines press offices said 
NonBrazilian carriers were not affected by the strike Friday 
Transbrasil Brazils other major airline operated normally after 
reaching a separate agreement with its flight crews 
Edson Antonio Matosinho one of the directors of Brazils 
12000member flight crew union said in a telephone interview that 
about 7000 Varig and Vasp employees joined the strike 
The strike was called to demand a 65 percent wage hike 
Matosinho said 
Flight crew workers salaries range from 385 to 3300 a month 
he said
