A pioneering health insurance bill requiring 
most businesses to offer medical plans survived what its sponsor 
called a long tortuous journey to committee approval with 
more rough traveling in store 
The minimum health bill approved 106 Wednesday by the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee would require coverage 
for up to 23 million of an estimated 38 million workers and 
dependents now going without it 
This has been a long tortuous journey committee chairman 
Edward Kennedy DMass said at the start of the meeting 
Kennedy said after the vote that he detected a very positive 
attitude but there were signs that the bill would continue on a 
rocky path 
It heads to the floor facing deepseated opposition from the 
business community the Reagan administration and conservative 
lawmakers And some prospective supporters were withholding favor 
until their specific problems with the bill could be resolved 
Under the bill employers would have to offer a minimum package 
including hospital care doctor care diagnostic and screening 
tests prenatal and wellbaby care and limited mental health 
treatment The policies would cap outofpocket catastrophic costs 
at 3000 
Coverage would have to be offered to employees working 175 
hours a week or more and their dependents 
Citizen Action a community group operating in two dozen states 
called the Kennedy measure desperately needed as more people 
are forced to accept jobs without health benefits and other workers 
find their benefits eroding 
In an attempt to accommodate employers the bill temporarily 
exempts small family farms and permits new firms to phase in 
coverage over two years Businesses of five or fewer people would 
have five years to phase in benefits Special regional pools would 
reduce costs to small businesses 
But critics were not mollified 
The US Chamber of Commerce denounced the bill in a statement 
as a cruel hoax destined to disappoint those it professes to 
help 
All the committee did was pay lip service to the problem 
without putting forward a workable or affordable solution said 
James Klein the groups manager of health care policy 
Sen Lowell Weicker RConn a cosponsor of the bill said 
insurance companies and small business groups helped draft it and 
he charged that they had acted in bad faith 
When it was all over they said thanks a lot for letting us 
be part of the process and were against it Weicker said 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates new coverage under the 
Kennedy bill would cost 27 billion with 12 billion of that 
offset by reductions in administrative costs charity care and 
other outlays CBO also says about 100000 jobs could be lost but 
could be offset by growth in the health sector 
The cost and scope of the bill as well as the potential for 
layoffs and job losses were criticized by Health and Human 
Services Secretary Otis Bowen and conservative lawmakers 
Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah called it a 30 billion solution to an 
8 billion problem and likened it to using a sledge hammer to 
crack an egg 
Bowen in a letter Tuesday to Kennedy said the bill would 
impose an unduly intrusive and centralist solution He 
recommended sharply focused state action instead
