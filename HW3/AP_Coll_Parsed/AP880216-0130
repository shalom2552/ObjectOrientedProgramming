Broadcast News and its stars 
William Hurt Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks headed the favorites 
to be on the list Wednesday when nominations for the 60th annual 
Academy Awards are announced 
Broadcast News directed by James L Brooks and Bernardo 
Bertoluccis The Last Emperor loomed largest in speculation 
leading up to the announcement at dawn 
The two films have attracted the majority of critics praise and 
prizes and each bears its makers stamp Brooks wrote produced 
and directed Broadcast News a caustic incisive view of how 
networks report the news Bertolucci cowrote and directed The 
Last Emperor the tragic life of Chinas boy ruler Henry Pu Yi 
Moonstruck Empire of the Sun and the years most 
talkedabout film Fatal Attraction also figured to be well 
represented among the nominees 
In the performing categories Miss Hunter was widely expected to 
be nominated as best actress for her Broadcast News role as a 
producer torn between a brilliant reporter played by Brooks and 
an emptyheaded but telegenic anchorman played by Hurt 
Also prominently mentioned for best actress were Cher as the 
widow who rediscovers passion in Moonstruck and Glenn Close as 
the vengeful single woman in Fatal Attraction 
Academy president Robert Wise and Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine 
will announce the nominations at the Academys Wilshire Boulevard 
headquarters shortly after 530 Wednesday morning The reason for 
the early hour the announcement will be carried live by NBCs 
Today CBS Morning Show ABCs Good Morning America 
and Cable News Network 
Ratings for the Oscar awards show have been slipping in recent 
years so the awards can use all the publicity they can manage 
Wise and MacLaine will recite nominees in 23 categories ranging 
from best picture to best cartoon One category will be missing 
best original song score The requirements are five original songs 
by one writer or team of writers for a single film and not one 
film qualified 
Oscar will have a new but familiar home for the 60th ceremonies 
on Monday April 11 The ceremonies are going back to the cavernous 
Shrine Auditorium near the Los Angeles Coliseum because the Music 
Center could not provide enough capacity or rehearsal time 
The Shrine where the music industry Grammy awards were held in 
past years housed the Oscars twice in the late 1940s The 
television Emmys will also be presented there this year and the 
American Music Awards are held there The Grammys are emanating 
from Radio City Music Hall in New York this year 
Samuel Goldwyn Jr is repeating as the Oscarcast producer So 
far he has scheduled these stars as hosts and presenters Chevy 
Chase Audrey Hepburn Michael Douglas John Lone and Joan Chen 
The Last Emperor Anjelica Huston John Candy Paul Newman 
and Marlee Matlin
