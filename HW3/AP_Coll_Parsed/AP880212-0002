The ripples from the Iowa precinct caucuses are 
spreading to New Hampshire boosting winners and damaging losers in 
the final days before the nations first primary polls indicate 
Vice President George Bush who was slipping in New Hampshire 
even before his thirdplace Iowa finish lost more ground in polls 
this week Democratic thirdplace finisher Michael Dukakis also 
lost support but not as much 
Iowa meanwhile has boosted the candidacies of Rep Richard 
Gephardt of Missouri and Sen Bob Dole of Kansas the Democratic 
and Republican winners and has aided Pat Robertson Iowas 
surprise secondplace Republican finisher the polls indicate 
As recently as two weeks ago Bush commanded the New Hampshire 
GOP field A CBS NewsNew York Times poll in the last week of 
January had him 22 percentage points over Dole the same place hed 
held in polls since November and earlier 
But a crack appeared last week when an ABC NewsWashington Post 
poll found Bushs lead sharply diminished to 7 percentage points 
After Iowas vote Monday ABC found the spread down to 4 percentage 
points Bush 33 Dole 29 
In a poll with an error margin of 6 percentage points that 
amounted to a dead heat Another survey done for The Boston Globe 
this week by pollster Gary Orren had essentially he same result 
Bush 29 Dole 27 CBS on Thursday had it as Bush 35 Dole 27 
still a big drop for the vice president 
Dole got a very big kick out of Iowa more than that there is 
some reluctance in the support for Bush Orren said Thursday 
Hes shown vulnerability and thats sort of arousing doubts 
people have about him 
The unanswered question is how far Bush will fall Richard 
Morin polling director for The Washington Post The expectation 
is that he will continue to drop Thats been the clear direction 
If voters were leaving Bush before Iowa it was not clear where 
they were going Morin said This week the chief gainers turned out 
to be Dole and Robertson whose support was up to 10 percent in the 
ABC and CBS polls from 6 percent last week and 4 percent two weeks 
ago 
Rep Jack Kemp of New York held steady at 13 percent in the ABC 
poll and fell from 16 percent to 12 percent in the CBS poll 
Analysts said he now may be challenged by Robertson for third place 
in New Hampshire 
Kemp was gaining last week Iowa ended that said Morin 
Iowas effect on the Democratic race probably is in the battle 
for second place not first pollsters said Massachusetts Gov 
Dukakis despite finishing third in Iowa maintained a strong lead 
in New Hampshire but he no longer had the huge 49 percent support 
indicated in an NBCWall Street Journal poll in November 
Three polls indicated a drop in support for Dukakis to 36 
percent in the ABCPost survey this week from 41 percent last week 
to 35 percent in the Globes survey from 38 percent last week and 
to 38 percent in the CBS poll from 40 percent in late January 
A fourth new poll however done for WBZTV in Boston WRCTV 
in Washington and the Boston Herald said Dukakis support had 
risen from 36 percent at the end of January to 44 percent this week 
Its a big lead for Dukakis no matter whose poll youre 
looking at and a strong one too said Jeff Alderman chief of 
polling for ABC News He said 58 percent of Dukakis backers told 
ABC they supported him strongly 
The win in Iowa transformed Gephardt who had singledigit 
support in New Hampshire as recently as last month The CBS poll 
had him at 19 percent up from 7 percent in late January ABCs 
poll put him this week at 22 percent up from 13 percent last week 
The Globe had him at 18 percent up from 8 and the WBZ poll had 
him at 17 up from 8 last month 
Poll results were more mixed on Gephardts chief rival Sen 
Paul Simon of Illinois the secondplace finisher in Iowa He moved 
to 18 percent from 13 percent in ABCs poll to 13 from 11 in WBZs 
and fell in the Globes to 12 from 17 He held about even in the 
CBS poll at 15 percent this week 
Movement is taking place at the bottom as well as the top of the 
pack Former Sen Gary Hart of Colorado who had 11 percent in the 
WBZ and Globe polls last week fell to singledigit support after 
winning just 1 percent in Iowa Hart and former Arizona Gov Bruce 
Babbitt also a poor finisher in Iowa went from 7 percent in ABCs 
New Hampshire poll last week to 4 percent this week
