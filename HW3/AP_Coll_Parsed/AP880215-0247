A new superconductor that operates at higher 
temperatures and may be easier to adapt to practical applications 
has been discovered by a research team in Japan scientists said 
Monday 
The superconductor is not merely a refinement of either of the 
two known hightemperature superconductors but an entirely new 
compound that in some respects may exceed the performance of the 
others said a panel of scientists at the annual meeting of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science 
The new material a mixture of bismuth strontium calcium 
copper and oxygen raises the temperature at which 
superconductivity occurs to about 243 degrees below zero 
Fahrenheit a jump of more than 50 degrees above levels attained 
with previous superconductors 
Scattered reports have appeared during the past year of 
superconductivity occurring at room temperature or even higher 
temperatures but those observations have not been confirmed and 
are not widely accepted 
In contrast the properties of the new material were confirmed 
within days after its discovery was disclosed on Jan 22 in a 
newspaper in Japan the researchers said 
I personally am quite happy we have found a third one said 
K Alex Mueller of IBM in Zurich He won a Nobel Prize last fall 
for his discovery in January 1986 of the first of the new 
hightemperature superconductors 
Muellers superconductor was made of lanthanum strontium 
copper and oxygen 
Superconductors carry electricity with no resistance and 
therefore no wasteful dissipation of electricity Before Muellers 
discovery superconductivity occurred only at temperatures a few 
degrees above absolute zero about 459 degrees below zero 
Fahrenheit Comparatively expensive liquid helium was required to 
cool them to the temperatures at which they became superconducting 
A year after Muellers discovery Paul Chu of the University of 
Houston and others discovered a second superconducting compound 
made of yttrium barium copper and oxygen that became a 
superconductor above the temperature of liquid nitrogen 321 
degrees below zero Fahrenheit That was important because liquid 
nitrogen is relatively inexpensive and widely available 
Later in the year researchers demonstrated that the second 
compound could carry significant amounts of electrical current an 
important requirement for practical application of superconductors 
Last month a Japanese team led by Hiroshi Maeda discovered the 
new bismuth superconductor Maeda did not attend Mondays meeting 
Mueller noted that for the third consecutive year a new 
superconductor has been discovered in January One may have hopes 
well have another in a year he said 
The new superconductor appears to be flexible suggesting that 
it might lend itself more easily than the others to the fabrication 
of wire said Angelica Stacey a chemist at the University of 
California Berkeley 
Because the superconductor operates at significantly higher 
temperatures its electrical properties at the temperature of 
liquid nitrogen may be superior to the properties of the other 
superconductors said John Rowell of Bell Communications Research 
in Red Bank NJ 
As a general rule the properties of superconductors improve the 
farther you go below the socalled transition temperature at which 
they become superconducting he explained 
Critical properties in addition to the transition temperature 
are the maximum current the superconductor can accommodate and the 
maximum magnetic field it can withstand Rowell said 
Another potential advantage of the new material is that bismuth 
is more stable than barium which means that the new superconductor 
might be less likely to break down chemically over a period of 
time said Stacey 
Although the researchers were optimistic that the new compound 
would have useful properties they said not enough time had yet 
elapsed for those properties to be measured 
Philip W Anderson a professor of physics at Princeton 
University in New Jersey said the availability of a third 
superconductor will make it easier for researchers to develop 
theories explaining how hightemperature superconductors work 
Anderson said he believes the new superconductors are profoundly 
different from conventional superconductors 
What weve discovered is not just a new kind of 
superconductor he said but a new kind of metal
