The Drug Enforcement Administration says 52 
pounds of cocaine taken by police working for Panamanian strongman 
Gen Manuel Antonio Noreiga was destroyed using proper police 
procedures 
David Westrate assistant administrator for operations at DEA 
defended the arrangement under which the special Panamanian police 
narcotics force took a portion of 752 pounds of cocaine flown from 
Bolivia to the United States by way of Panama as part of an 
undercover investigation 
The relationship of DEA agents and Panamanian authorities is 
under criticism in Congress after Noriegas indictment by grand 
juries in Florida on charges of drug trafficking and racketeering 
Its our understanding and belief that the cocaine left with 
the Panamanians was appropriately disposed of Westrate said 
Wednesday in an interview My understanding is that it 
subsequently was destroyed in a regular destruction exercise they 
had there 
After the Panamanians received the 52 pounds in April 1986 the 
remainder was reloaded onto a DEA plane and flown to the United 
States It was used as evidence in a federal trial that year in 
Roanoke Va where 10 people were convicted including reputed 
Bolivian cocaine dealer Gerardo Caballero 
Caballero has since said that Noriega set him up as a favor to 
Colombian cocaine lords who wanted him out of their way 
The cocaine left in Panama was to have been used in a potential 
prosecution in that country which didnt materialize said Westrate 
We do utilize a reverse undercover technique where agents are 
sellers rather than purchasers said Westrate The 52 pounds of 
cocaine was retained in Panama for that purpose 
Under such operations drug enforcement agents offer drugs to 
suspected dealers then confiscate the dealers cash after making 
arrests 
The DEA official said its not unusual for countries 
involved as transit points in the controlled movement of 
narcotics to retain portions of the narcotics for use in 
investigations 
During the trial in Roanoke DEA agent Thomas Telles testified 
under questioning from defense attorney Jonathan M Apgar that the 
agency arranged for the cocaine to be flown from Bolivia to Panama 
Telles disputed the notion that the cocaine was a payment for 
the Panamanians assistance in rounding up Caballero and another 
man convicted in the Roanoke case Luis TangFortaleche
