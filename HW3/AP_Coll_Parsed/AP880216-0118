troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in 
our unit

base and were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers there

Soviet intermediate range rockets stationed in East Germany could 
be removed ahead of schedule but gave no specific timetable for 
their withdrawal

transport back to the Soviet Union It also did not say if other 
missiles stationed in East Germany had been dismantled or how many 
troops were scheduled to leave 
The report written by an ADN correspondent described 
preparations under way to ready the rockets for transport 
Cranes were used to load the dismantled rockets into transport 
containers the report said 
We were convinced that the last rockets were ready for 
transport to the location where they will be destroyed the ADN 
correspondent said
