The New Hampshire of white steepled 
churches and treelined lakes still exists But when presidential 
candidates want to find lots of voters they go to malls that could 
just as easily be in New Jersey as in New Hampshire 
Gone are the small southern New Hampshire farms whose owners set 
up stands to sell eggs and sweet corn to weekend drivers from 
Massachusetts Theyve been replaced by hightech companies and 
suburban sprawl 
Also ebbing is the personal touch that has been a hallmark of 
many New Hampshire campaigns 
There was a time when New Hampshire voters really did meet 
presidential candidates shake hands and question them eye to eye 
met most of them and often met them more than once 
But most people who voted in the state primary on Tuesday 
especially those who live south of Concord the state capital got 
no closer to a candidate than their television sets 
Maybe that doesnt matter 
Dayton Duncan who was deputy press spokesman for Walter F 
Mondales 1984 presidential campaign is working on a book about 
the New Hampshire primary In four bitterly contested primaries he 
points out the winner never set foot in the state 
When Dwight D Eisenhower beat Robert A Taft in 1952 and Henry 
Cabot Lodge upset Barry Goldwater in 1964 the winner not only 
shook no voters hand he wasnt even in the country 
Lyndon B Johnson beat Eugene McCarthy in 1968 and Jimmy Carter 
defeated Edward M Kennedy in 1980 In both cases the winners were 
incumbent presidents under severe challenge They won without ever 
campaigning personally in the state 
Although he lost McCarthy did well enough to startle observers 
and send the first clear message that Johnson was in political 
trouble 
In 1976 President Gerald R Ford campaigned three days in New 
Hampshire and still beat challenger Ronald Reagan 
The North Country most closely resembles the New Hampshire of 
post cards and calendars Nestled in the valleys of the White 
Mountains are scores of towns and pristine lakes stands of pine 
and white birch 
But look closely Also part of that landscape now are massive 
condominium developments second homes to thousands of people in 
the Northeast Corridor 
In fact candidates run the risk in New Hampshire that the hand 
they shake may mark a ballot in some other state 
George Bush greeted voters at Pheasant Lane Mall the states 
newest and biggest enclosed paradise for shoppers It sits on New 
Hampshires southern border and the odds are that the vice 
president met more people from Massachusetts than from New 
Hampshire 
Six candidates spoke at a Rally Finale at the Mall of New 
Hampshire Their platform was set up between the Florsheim shoe 
store and Zales Jewelers 
Huge television screens projected the candidates images 
throughout the covered mall and that was how most people saw them 
Shoppers who tried to crowd in close enough to actually view a 
candidate in the flesh were frustrated by a platform set up for 
television cameras 
We cant see we cant see they chanted 
It was New Hampshire in 1988 At least thats what the sign on 
the platform said
