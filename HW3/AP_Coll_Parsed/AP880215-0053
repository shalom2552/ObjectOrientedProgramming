Officials at the Canann Valley Ski 
Resort say an explosion and fire that killed three maintenance 
workers may have been touched off by a compressor used for 
snowmaking 
The blaze fed by at least five 55gallon drums of fuel housed 
in the maintenance area gutted the building Sunday authorities 
said 
Resort spokesman Andy Snyder said it appeared the compressor 
part of a snowmaking machine exploded and set off the fire It 
took firefighters about an hour to reach the victims No other 
injuries were reported 
I was on the slope opposite it when it blew said Bob 
Gribbin of Springfield Va I heard an explosion and fire came 
shooting out the back side of the building Flames shot out to the 
back wall of the maintenance area I guess it was about 40 feet 
The maintenance shop located at the base of the mountain is 
used to repair resort vehicles and snowmaking machines and also 
houses the compressors said Canaan Valley State Park spokesman 
Steve Drumheller 
Snyder said the compressors had been used to make snow as late 
as Sunday morning but were shut off sometime before noon when 
temperatures rose above freezing 
Firefighters from seven fire departments were called to help put 
out the fire in the stone and wood building he said The resorts 
beginners area was closed for about three hours 
Authorities identified the dead as Ronald L Hanlon 33 Dale W 
Liller 25 and Randy Lee Crowl 24 all of Davis
