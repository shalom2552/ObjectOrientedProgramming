Anatomically modern humans lived in Israel 
92000 years ago scientists said today in a study that pushes back 
the earliest known reliable date for the ancient humans by some 
50000 years 
The finding supports the hypothesis that anatomically modern 
humans evolved in Africa rather than independently in several 
places and weighs against the idea that they descended from 
Neanderthals scientists said 
The study reported by scientists from France and Israel is 
very important for the study of the human evolution said David 
Pilbeam anthrolopology professor at Harvard University 
The work appears in todays issue of the British journal Nature 
Researchers reported that 20 burnt flints found along with 
ancient human remains in the Qafzeh cave in lower Galilee were 
about 92000 years old give or take 5000 years So the ancient 
humans lived there that long ago researchers said 
That means some anatomically modern humans occupied southwest 
Asia before Neanderthals arrived a sharp challenge to the view 
that they evolved from Neanderthals wrote Chris Stringer of the 
British Museum Natural History in an editorial accompanying the 
report 
Neanderthals lived in Europe and Asia from about 150000 or 
200000 years ago until about 35000 years ago 
Harvards Pilbeam said the Israeli finding more than doubles 
what was previously accepted as a really good age for modern 
humans which was 35000 to 40000 years 
Eric Delson anthropology professor at Lehman College in New 
York said some fossils from Africa suggests ages of 90000 years 
and even older for modern humans but that the evidence for those 
dates is not firm 
In a telephone interview Delson said the new finding supports 
the view that modern man arose in Africa because it provides an 
early date for their living near that continent The theory holds 
that more than 100000 years ago modern humans split into a group 
that stayed in Africa and another that went to Europe and Asia 
The humans in the Israeli cave may well have been members of 
early Eurasian stock different from any living race but near the 
common ancestor of nonAfricans Delson said 
Stringer in his editorial said the early date for the Israeli 
population poses some questions such as why modern humans took 
another 50000 years to register their presence in Europe and the 
Far East 
Perhaps the environment to the north was too unsuitable or the 
Neanderthals too well established to allow a migration until all 
that time had elapsed he said Or perhaps they did migrate 
earlier and their fossil remains have yet to be discovered
