Abdel Latif Mahmoud Ishtiah 19 was interrogated for half an

and then poured sand over them with a bulldozer 
The four were unconcious when relatives rescued them after 
several minutes according to villagers quoted in Israeli 
newspapers Three were treated at a West Bank hospital and released 
the same day and the fourth was hospitalized for eight days the 
reports said 
Limping badly and with both hands bandaged halfway up the 
forearm Ishtiah was helped from the van by Arab villagers today 
after the interrogation 
I am afraid he told reporters saying he still dreams about 
the horror of being buried alive and believes he was very close to 
death Ishtiah said police also threatened to arrest him if he 
didnt tell the truth 
The villagers said one of the four youths was too badly injured 
in the legs to walk to the van and the other two were not at home 
at the time of Ishtiahs questioning 
In continuing violence today riot police fired tear gas in the 
Arab east Jerusalem village of Sur Bahir to subdue Palestinian 
protesters who erected roadblocks Associated Press photographer

In an army communique today West Bank commander Maj Gen Amram 
Mitzna ordered military police to investigate the Kfar Salem 
incident 
This investigation is receiving the highest priority So far 
two soldiers have been detained and other detentions are expected 
in the near future said the communique Under Israels system 
charges are not filed until probes are completed but suspects may 
be placed in custody pending the outcome 
Army radio quoted Mitzna as saying a sergeantmajor from the 
military government established by Israel in the West Bank and two 
or three other soldiers were involved and would be brought to trial 
While supervising an arrest operation of suspected Arab 
agitators in the West Bank village of Abu Dis today Mitzna told 
army radio Even in my worst dreams I would never imagine such a 
thing even though I constantly warn commanders to expect the most 
awful things that could happen when soldiers find themselves all of 
a sudden commanding and deciding the lives of citizens 
A reporter for the Yediot Ahronot newspaper said he saw on 
Sunday a foothigh mound of earth where the incident allegedly took 
place Reporters for the Jerusalem weekly Kol Hair said Friday 
they dug out a shoe from the dirt 
Army officials on Sunday said they were investigating a similar

have entered their 10th week According to UN figures 54 Arabs 
have been killed by Israelis since demonstrations began 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today left on a visit to Italy 
after telling reporters he did not agree with US Secretary of 
State George P Shultzs statement that ArabIsraeli negotiations 
must involve a landforpeace trade 
The concept of territorial compromise underpins the latest US 
proposals for starting a peace process but has led to opposition 
from Shamirs Likud bloc which is against the return of the 
occupied lands to Arab sovereignty 
On Sunday riot police in the Golan Heights fired tear gas and 
rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of stonethrowing Druse
