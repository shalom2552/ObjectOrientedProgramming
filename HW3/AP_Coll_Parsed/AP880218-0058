Gov Evan Mecham won a oneweek delay in his 
impeachment trial but the Senate rejected his effort to have it 
postponed until after he faces criminal charges of concealing a 
campaign loan 
The governors attorney Murray Miller would not say after the 
votes Wednesday whether he would follow through on an earlier 
threat to take the issue to court if the Senate did not grant a 
delay 
We will do whatever we think is appropriate to protect all the 
governors rights Miller said 
Millers motion to delay the trial until 20 days after the 
resolution of the criminal case lost on a voice vote and a motion 
to delay the Senate proceeding a flat 90 days went down 245 with 
five Republicans supporting the governor 
Mecham was impeached Feb 5 for allegedly concealing a 350000 
campaign loan misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund 
by loaning it to his auto dealership and trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official 
In addition at least 77 people are considering challenging 
Mecham in a recall election May 17 including a former congressman 
and a former state school superintendent beaten by the Republican 
in a threeway race in 1986 
The Senate agreed to delay the start of its trial from Monday to 
Feb 29 after state Chief Justice Frank Gordon advised that a 
oneweek postponement would actually save time because both sides 
could settle some issues beforehand Gordon is the presiding 
officer in the impeachment trial 
Miller has contended that holding the impeachment trial before 
the end of the criminal trial which is scheduled to begin March 9 
would prejudice the criminal trial jury and harm the governors 
right to a fair decision 
But Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane a Republican warned 
There is an ongoing fear that this will be the beginning of 
lots of motions for continuations by Miller 
Senators also refused to drop or revise a rule adopted last week 
that allows the Senate to hold closed meetings during the 
impeachment trial 
Lawmakers said last week the meetings could be held to consult 
with lawyers discuss what questions could be asked or which 
witnesses to call and make final deliberations on whether to 
convict Mecham 
The idea of closed meetings was sharply criticized by the media 
and 11 senators boycotted a brief closed meeting held during 
Tuesdays session Sen Greg Lunn a Republican said that keeping 
the closed meetings could be feeding the worst suspicions of 
those in the public who are distrustful of our motives
