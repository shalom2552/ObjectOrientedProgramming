A telephone company attempting to recruit 
workers finds 84 percent of applicants fail the entrylevel test A 
congressional study shows most highschool juniors cannot write a 
simple letter seeking a summer job

Illiteracy caused by poor education has become an economic time 
bomb threatening both the quality of the American work force and 
the nations ability to compete on world markets government 
policymakers say 
The Department of Education estimates more than 27 million 
Americans older than 17 cannot read or write well enough to perform 
basic requirements of everyday life Another 45 million are 
considered barely competent in basic skills 
That means more than 72 million one out of every three adults 
may lack the reading and writing skills they need to find work 
And the number is growing annually by more than 2 million federal 
officials say 
These statistics coincide with a surge in demand for workers who 
not only can read and write but who also can use computers 
understand technological concepts and think independently in an 
economy that is shifting to services and information and away from 
manufacturing 
Moreover this erosion of worker literacy comes at a time when 
Americas competitors in Asia and Europe are forging ahead with 
educated work forces that may come to dominate the hightechnology 
business of the 21st century 
We need to determine what to do with the substantial fraction 
of our population thats illequipped to compete in a global 
economy said Indiana University professor Lawrence Mikulecky 
A study commissioned by the Department of Labor titled 
Workforce 2000 published last June estimated that between now 
and the end of the century for the first time in US history a 
majority of all new jobs will require postsecondary education 
This prospect presents a great risk to minority workers who 
historically have lacked the schooling and skills needed to exploit 
job opportunities said the study conducted by the Hudson 
Institute a private research organization 
If that pattern persists the study said by the year 2000 
the problems of minority unemployment crime and dependency will be 
worse than they are today Without substantial adjustments blacks 
and Hispanics will have a smaller fraction of the jobs of the year 
2000 than they have today while their share of those seeking work 
will have risen 
The problem is compounded by a declining number of people 
entering the labor pool a consequence of the sharp dropoff in 
birth rates that followed the postwar baby boom 
Some personnel executives say the literacy crisis already has 
hurt them New York Telephone Co discovered last year that 84 
percent of its New York City applicants flunked the companys 
entrylevel exam which included basic questions on vocabulary and 
numerical relationships 
The Business Council for Effective Literacy a 
corporatesponsored group has documented instances in which 
employees misordered millions of dollars in parts overpaid bills 
and endangered workplace safety In one case a feedlot operator 
who misread a label killed a pen full of cattle by giving them 
poison instead of grain 
Foreign companies building factories in the United States also 
have been rudely awakened At Toyota Motor Corps US 
manufacturing operations for example personnel managers now test 
the educational level of all prospective employees 
Theyre not just assuming that because someone comes in with a 
highschool diploma hes going to be prepared said Paul Jurmo 
program associate at the Business Council for Effective Literacy 
Definitions of literacy vary greatly but some tests have served 
as important guides In 1985 for example the Department of 
Education asked 3400 people aged 20 and older to answer at least 
20 of 26 simple questions correctly Nearly 13 percent failed 
Other measurements are considered equally discouraging A study 
mandated by Congress in 1984 found that fewer than 400 of 2000 
11th graders could adequately write a note applying for a summer 
job at a swimming pool 
College Board test scores have fallen about 8 percent over the 
past 20 years while test performance abroad has risen In an 
international calculus and algebra test done a few years ago the 
best US 12th graders came in last among students from the most 
developed countries Japanese finished first 
Estimates on the cost of workplace illiteracy also vary but are 
believed to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars The 
Institute for the Study of Adult Literacy at Penn State University 
has said the cost is at least 225 billion per year just in terms 
of lost productivity welfare and related crime and prison expenses 
In addition at least 25 billion is spent by companies and 
private groups to upgrade worker education but most of this effort 
reaches only a small fraction of those who need it most says David 
Harman a Columbia University professor who has done extensive 
research in the area 
A great deal of illiteracy remains obscured partly because many 
older employees are sensitive about their lack of skills fearing 
they could be fired or face ridicule by seeking help 
Some devise elaborate ways to conceal inability to read or 
write including feigning nearsightnedess or taking job 
applications home to have spouses complete them said Eli Zal 
executive director of Literacy Volunteers of New York City Inc a 
nonprofit group that organizes classes for adults 
There are some encouraging signs Millions of illiterate or 
barely literate adults are starting to take advantage of a growing 
range of educational programs offered not only by voluntary and 
government groups but labor unions and employers themselves 
The federally funded Adult Basic Education program the largest 
single literacy effort in the nation enrolled 31 million people 
in 1986 up from 25 million in 1984 
Many large companies have started contributing money to 
community efforts drafted tutors to help disadvantaged workers and 
organized schools of last resort to provide basic instruction 
General Motors Corp and International Business Machines Corp 
for example together spend at least 700 million annually on adult 
education Other companies such as Polaroid Corp Standard Oil 
Co Ford Motor Co and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group offer 
remedial classes in plants and offices 
Part of this corporate effort arises from a gradual realization 
among executives that its in their longterm interest to have an 
adaptable and educated work force But many in business still may 
not appreciate the magnitude of the crisis according to Robert W 
Goddard publication director at Liberty Mutual Insurance who 
wrote on the subject in a recent issue of Personnel Journal 
magazine 
The major force driving corporate America to attack illiteracy 
is the same one that united the colonies 200 years ago Either hang 
together on this issue or hang separately said Goddard
