Secretary of State George Shultz sought 
support Wednesday for his proposals to revive the moribund Mideast 
peace process meeting with Israeli envoy Abba Eban and members of 
the Senate 
Shultz who leaves for Moscow late this week will travel to the 
Middle East at the end of the month to try to push Arab and Israeli 
leaders toward the negotiating table 
Shultz appears encouraged by the support hes gotten so far 
for his proposals Eban told reporters following a 30minute 
meeting with the secretary But he added that the positions of 
the various sides are still far apart and one should not expect the 
ice to melt right away 
Eban said he supports Shultzs initiative and the high degree 
of his activism I dont think this is just a symbolic effort and 
that the Americans will withdraw afterward This is a serious 
initiative 
Shultz is laying the groundwork for the next US administration 
to continue mediation efforts between Arabs and Israelis Eban said 
Eban is a member of the Labor Party headed by Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres who favors the Shultz plan His rival in the 
coalition government Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has expressed 
some reservations 
Eban said he hopes Shultz can overcome Shamirs hesitancy 
At the Capitol Sen Alan Cranston DCalif said Shultz did 
not outline any magic solution or precise plan for dealing with 
the problems of the Middle East other than to say he would devote 
himself to the search for a breakthrough 
Cranston said Shultz did provide assurances that contrary to 
some reports Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is not opting out of 
the peace process 
The senator said Shultz responding to a question said the 
United States has urged Israel not to use undue violence in 
dealing with rebellious Palestinians but also has expressed 
understanding that some strength is needed to deal with the 
situation 
Senate Majority Leader Robert C Byrd DWVa said he believes 
that it is high time Shultz visited the area in an attempt to 
revitalize the peace process 
What we see going on there is a tragic situation and what we 
see on our newscasts every evening certainly doesnt go over very 
well with the American people Byrd said 
Shultz met Tuesday night with some 25 members of the House to 
present his proposals and arranged to lay out his plans for 
senators Wednesday night 
The plan he will propose in his Mideast talks has not been made 
public but it reportedly calls for ArabIsraeli negotiations to 
start in April on an interim autonomy agreement for the 15 million 
Palestinians in the Israelioccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
It envisions that talks on the permanent fate of the territories 
would begin in December 
Several Arab leaders have rejected the interim solution included 
in the Shultz proposal while Shamir opposes the notion of 
negotiating for a permanent solution Shamir fears that such talks 
would force Israel to give back the lands it captured from the 
Arabs in the 1967 Middle East war 
Shultzs reengagement in the peace process was sparked by two 
months of rioting in the occupied territories in which at least 53 
Palestinians have been killed
