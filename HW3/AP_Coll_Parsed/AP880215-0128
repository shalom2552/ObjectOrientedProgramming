Bophuthatswana tribal homeland has unleashed a reign of terror 
since a coup attempt was crushed last week a prominent clergyman 
said Monday

Council of Churches said hundreds of people from the home area of 
the coup leaders had been harassed or detained by soldiers of

MalebaneMetsings party abd people thought to have voted for it 
last year 
He said a crackdown could provoke massive resistance that may 
result in a violent confrontation between the South Africanbacked

attempt by white authorities to divide and weaken the black
