Bob Dole who came from behind only to 
fall back in the final week of the presidential primary campaign 
sought Tuesday to put a positive face on his secondplace finish 
It looks like Vice President George Bush may have won so 
weve made up a lot of ground here in the last few days the 
Senate minority leader said 
Its been as Ive said for some time a twoperson race 
Weve made a lot of progress the last few days We didnt quite 
pull it off here but we feel pretty good about it Dole said in 
an interview 
Earlier Dole blamed unfair attacks for the results 
If it hadnt been for the distortion of my positions on tax 
increases and an oil import fee Id be 10 points ahead he said 
You shouldnt distort someones record I could do that to 
him but I wont He pledged however to straighten out my 
record Its not going to take long 
Dole won convincingly in the first major test of the season 
beating Bush 21 in last weeks Iowa caucuses 
Polls before the caucuses showed Dole trailing Bush by as much 
as 20 percentage points in New Hampshire but Dole came on strong 
to make the race a virtual deadheat as the voting began 
Dole was upbeat early Tuesday 
It feels good like it did in Iowa last Monday he said 
Bush with a home just outside New Hampshire on the Maine coast 
had long considered New Hampshire friendly territory just as Iowa 
was seen as home turf for Dole who is from neighboring Kansas 
Dole also benefited from President Reagans comparatively low 
popularity among Republicans in Iowa and suffered from Reagans 
strength in New Hampshire where Reagan beat thenrival Bush 21 in 
the 1980 GOP primary 
The fact the vice president moves out of New Hampshire with 35 
percent of the vote in a state which has 2 percent unemployment a 
state in which Ronald Reagan is 82 percent popular I dont 
think that bodes well for what will happen for Bush down South 
said Sen Warren Rudman Doles most prominent New Hampshire backer
