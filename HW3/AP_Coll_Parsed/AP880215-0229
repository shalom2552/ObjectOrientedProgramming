The queen of offBroadway has enlarged her 
kingdom this season 
At an age when most people would have been retired for nearly 20 
years Lucille Lortel has gone uptown with two major Broadway 
productions Sarafina an exuberant South African musical 
and A Walk in the Woods a drama about American and Soviet arms 
control negotiators 
Not exactly commercial fluff but then making money never was 
the reason Miss Lortel got into producing more than 40 years ago in 
the backyard of her Connecticut home 
If a work is theatrical and if its something that moves me 
then I will do it she says It is the theatricality of a play 
that appeals to me not necessarily the subject matter 
Miss Lortel stylishly dressed in a blackandwhite striped 
blouse and a black skirt sits in the living room of her Fifth 
Avenue apartment Her theater past is there along with the 
present An oil portrait of Miss Lortel hangs above an elegant 
couch 
The apartment is award heaven A Tony stands on a table There 
are proclamations declarations decrees and a parade of 
photographs in almost every room 
There is a photograph of Miss Lortel with Sam Waterston and 
Robert Prosky the two stars of A Walk in the Woods The play 
by Broadway newcomer Lee Blessing focuses on the informal 
oneonone meetings of an American delegate and his Soviet 
counterpart to the nuclear disarmament talks in Geneva The two men 
break diplomatic red tape by taking walks in the woods to discuss 
their countries problems 
Darling I fell in love with A Walk in the Woods when I saw 
it at Yale last year she recalls I felt that I had to do it 
And its important enough and good enough to do on Broadway 
Miss Lortel backs up her opinions with her money some 850000 
plus to put A Walk in the Woods a one set twocharacter 
drama on Broadway 
I tell you its a feeling I have like when you seen a fine 
painting or something she says You cant explain it or why 
you feel emotional about it This is the way I feel about plays 
The money was left her by her husband Louis Schweitzer who 
made his fortune in the cigarette paper business It was Schweitzer 
who got her out of and then back into the theater 
When they met during the Depression Miss Lortel was an aspiring 
actress By then she had appeared on Broadway portraying a slave 
girl in Caesar and Cleopatra starring Helen Hayes 
I next played a virgin in The Virgin Man and then a 
nymphomaniac in The Shanghai Gesture she laughs I had very 
long flowing hair in those days 
In fact a couple of those pictures on the piano might show 
what I looked like then she says gesturing to a provocative 
almost modern photograph of a young seductivelooking woman Im 
a little shocked at myself when I see them 
Schweitzer and Miss Lortel were married in March 1931 on the 
luxury liner Leviathan as the couple was returning from Europe The 
new wife continued to dabble in show business but eventually gave 
up her career 
You have to remember it was 1931 honey and his family was 
very strict she recalls He wasnt but his family was In 
fact my husband called me Volly meaning voluptuous 
Sixteen years later Miss Lortel found herself back in show 
business pretty much by accident Friends were looking for a place 
to hold a reading of a new play and she offered the old white barn 
on her 18acre Westport Conn estate A new summer theater was 
born 
In the beginning it wasnt so much that I picked the plays 
she recalls They picked me Usually a director or a playwright 
came to me with something 
At the White Barn Theater she gave work to actors like Zero 
Mostel Eva Marie Saint and Kim Hunter and life to experimental 
plays or new works by unknown authors Over the years as the White 
Barns chief decision maker and financial backer she has produced 
scores of works including Athol Fugards Blood Knot Sean 
OCaseys Red Roses for Me Edward Albees Fam and Yam and 
Paul Zindels The Effect of Gamma Rays on ManintheMoon 
Marigolds 
As a 24th anniversary present Schweitzer bought his wife the 
Theater de Lys a small offBroadway playhouse in 1955 The first 
play she produced there a revival of the WeillBrecht musical 
The Threepenny Opera ran for seven years 
The shows long run stymied Miss Lortels producing instincts 
so she took to presenting weekly matinee performances of new and 
old works at the de Lys while Threepenny was running at night 
Richard Burton read Shakespeare Siobhan McKenna played Hamlet 
Lotte Lenya recalled the life of Bertolt Brecht The Matinee Series 
lasted nearly 20 years before Miss Lortel decided it had run its 
course All her work led her to be dubbed the Queen of 
offBroadway by Washington Post theater critic Richard L Coe 
The name stuck 
Schweitzer died in 1971 but his wife kept busy looking after 
her offBroadway property renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in 
1981 running the White Barn and coproducing several Broadway 
shows including Angels Fall and As Is 
Today Miss Lortel keeps busy seeing new works and rarely is 
home during the evening Often shes out five nights a week 
looking at Broadway offBroadway offoffBroadway and even 
showcase productions for new scripts 
My life is the theater she says I didnt have any 
children but the theater is my child Since my husband died I 
dont know what I would have done without it Its been my whole 
life Its a wonderful place to go You lose yourself in it 
especially if its good
