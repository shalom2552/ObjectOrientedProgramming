Abbas Ali Hamadi told an 
acquaintance we have kidnapped a West German after a foreign 
businessman was abducted in Beirut last year according to 
testimony Wednesday in Hamadis trial 
Hamadi is charged with the January 1987 kidnapping of Rudolf 
Cordes and another West German in Beirut 
The abductions were allegedly carried out to pressure Bonn to 
free Abbas Hamadis brother Mohammed Ali Hamadi who is being held 
in connection with the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which an 
American sailor died 
Federal investigator Klaus Pruefer testified that an 
acquaintance of Abbas Hamadi Hamsa Kassim told police the 
defendant informed him that Cordes had been kidnapped 
According to a police statement Kassim quoted Abbas Hamadi as 
saying by telephone from Beirut We have kidnapped a West 
German 
Excerpts of Kassims statement to police were read on Wednesday 
In one excerpt Kassim said Hamadi told him that Mohammed Hamadi 
was arrested because He was one of the kidnappers of the American 
TWA jetliner 
Kassim told police that Abbas Hamadi made that statement Jan 
14 1987 one day after his 23yearold brother was arrested at 
Frankfurt airport carrying explosives 
The following week Cordes and another West German Alfred 
Schmidt were kidnapped in Beirut 
Last week Schmidt testified that Abbas Hamadi was not among the 
gunmen who kidnapped him from his Beirut hotel Jan 20 He said 
Abbas Hamadi was older and taller than the men who abducted him 
Schmidt was released in September in what his kidnappers said 
was a goodwill gesture Cordes is still being held 
Last year West Germany rejected a US request for the 
extradition of Mohammed Hamadi in the TWA hijacking West German 
authorities last week charged him with murder and air piracy the 
same charges he would have faced in the United States A trial date 
has not been set 
A third West German citizen Ralph Rudolf Schray was kidnapped 
in Beirut three weeks ago in an apparent attempt to increase 
pressure on West Germany to release the Hamadi brothers 
No one has claimed responsibility for that kidnapping
