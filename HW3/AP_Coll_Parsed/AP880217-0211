Richard Gephardt focused on South 
Dakota Wednesday in an urgent search for a primary victory even as 
he contended second place in New Hampshire was good enough to put 
him in a twoman Democratic presidential race with Michael Dukakis 
I dont think there really is a true frontrunner today 
Gephardt said Its a tough race now I think in the rest of the 
country between Dukakis and Gephardt I think thats really 
what this race is going to boil down to 
Gephardt spoke as he left Manchester NH for Rapid City and 
Sioux Falls SD to trumpet an endorsement by Democratic Sen Tom 
Daschle in a state where next Tuesdays primary does not guarantee 
delegates 
Gephardts claim to a twoman nomination battle overlooked two 
other Democratic candidates who have staked much of their hopes and 
spent much of their time in the looming delegate battleground of 
the South Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr 
It also ignored Illinois Sen Paul Simon whose campaign limped 
into neighboring Minnesota after backtoback narrow losses to 
Gephardt in New Hampshire and Iowa 
Gephardts leading rivals were campaigning in the South for much 
of what is to be a threeweek campaign there His focus instead was 
on a far less significant state on the primary calender where the 
Democratic primary Tuesday is a beauty contest in which voters 
state a preference that does not commit convention delegates 
Gephardt was scheduled to visit South Dakota during six of the 
next seven days He was gambling on a victory that would attract 
attention and make him look like a winner heading toward March 8 
when nearly onethird of the Democratic delegates are at stake 
I think I can do well here Gephardt said in an interview 
In order to do that I have to get my message across and see 
people 
This is just the way we think the time can be best spent to 
get the delegates to get the results we need he said 
He was also contesting Wyomings caucuses where 13 delegates 
are at stake on March 5 
Were doing a lot of South Dakota and Wyoming shuttling 
said Ali Webb Gephardts press secretary 
She called them gateway states to Super Tuesday and said they 
are very important to us 
Gephardt strategists said they decided not to contest three 
other states holding contests during the next three weeks Vermont 
aod Maine where Dukakis figures to be strong and Minnesota where 
Dukakis and Simon are campaigning 
The congressman attended a rally with Daschle in Sioux Falls and 
toured a financially troubled electronics assembly plant in Rapid 
City where he attacked unfair trade practices by Japan 
Gephardt has purchased 40000 worth of television commercials 
in South Dakota a significant amount in the state of just 700000 
people Gore and Dukakis are already on the air here 
Gephardt polltaker Ed Reilly contended that because of intensive 
television coverage of the candidates whereever they are Gephardt 
can campaign in South Dakota and Wyoming and still attract 
attention in the process in the Southern states where so many 
delegates are at stake 
Time spent doing media markets in the South is an wellspent 
in these states there will be a focus on these events he said 
Gephardt won 20 percent of the vote Tuesday in New Hampshires 
leadoff primary behind Dukakis who finished with 37 percent 
It was far from a victory but Gephardt celebrated as if it were 
one because he ran ahead of fellow Midwesterner Simon and the rest 
of the field Simon had predicted he would best Gephardt in New 
Hampshire and his third place finish with 18 percent put him in 
danger of being unable to raise the money necessary to sustain his 
indebted candidacy 
Gephardt said Gore and Jackson will be tough opponents in the 
South But he portrayed himself as better able to take the battle 
to the rest of country with his message of foreign trade sanctions 
and no tax increases for low and middleincome people 
Polls have shown Gephardt ran particularly well among 
bluecollar and union voters in Iowa and New Hampshire and he is 
likely to bid for those voters in the South 
Trade energy and agriculture are strong issues in the 
South he said Those are issues Ive defined and I think were 
going to do well there
