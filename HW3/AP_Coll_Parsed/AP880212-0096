A team of doctors Friday reattached a 
mans left hand to his arm 2 months after it was joined to blood 
vessels in his abdomen for temporary preservation following an 
accident 
Twelve doctors and support staff spent 22 hours in surgery on 
Mike Thomas a 31yearold ironworker from Cleveland Ala He was 
listed in serious condition 
The accident in which Thomas lost his hand was a pulling and 
tearing injury rather than a clean cut making it difficult for 
doctors to determine the extent of possible nerve damage They also 
were concerned about the potential for infection in the wound 
Therefore they decided to attach the hand to his abdomen to 
preserve it for a future reattachment to his arm 
The blood flow has been reestablished but it might be weeks 
or months before we can determine how much function hell have 
said Virginia Perrin of University Hospitals public relations 
office 
Thomas might be able to leave the hospital within two weeks 
although further surgery might be needed she said 
So far so good seems to be the attitude right now Mrs 
Perrin said 
Thomas lost the hand wrist and a small part of his forearm when 
he grabbed a cable to break a 70foot fall from a girder while he 
was working at a church Nov 24 
The cable wrapped around his forearm and pulled his hand off 
about six inches above his wrist 
The day after Thomas fell plastic and reconstructive surgeons 
attached the arteries veins and skin of the hand to those of his 
abdomen 
Such a temporary attachment has been used twice once 
successfully in Yugoslavia 
To our knowledge this is the first time a severed limb as 
been kept this way in the United States said Hank Black 
spokesman for the hospital 
The surgeons goal was to give Thomas a hand with enough 
sensation to protect it from injury and to allow him the use of it 
as a helping hand one that is better in appearance than a false 
one Black said
