A few leftovers from the New Hampshire 
primary campaign tales of food and love laughs and life along the 
political trail 
First the food Presidential candidates have such tight 
schedules they often dont get a chance to eat 
Sen Paul Simon of Illinois detoured through a Burger King 
drivein for a hamburger on one swing Former Gov Bruce Babbitt of 
Arizona dined on finger sandwiches at a Head Start center 
But Vice President George Bush ate three breakfasts within an 
hour one morning not because he was hungry but because the polls 
had him running behind Sen Bob Dole of Kansas 
Bush had switched his campaign style to one of more informality 
sliding into booths with voters for pancakes at Bickfords family 
restaurant coffee at Dunkin Donuts and anEgg McMuffin at 
McDonalds 
The next morning on voting day in the New Hampshire primary a 
woman at the polls told Bush she had skipped breakfast to see him 
Im not having breakfast today he said I had three of 
them yesterday

Now some love notes 
Bushs son Neil met a young woman from Nashua named Sharon 
while campaigning for his father in the New Hampshire primary eight 
years ago George Bush lost that one to Ronald Reagan but Neil 
Bush won Sharon They were married and came back to campaign for 
Bush this time 
After Simon had telephoned Soviet refusenik Elena KeisKuna in 
Leningrad to offer his support and best wishes she sent him a 
kiss On that same day Sunday Valentines Day Simon campaigned 
in the streets of Manchester One of his stops was a florists shop 
where he presented his wife Jeanne with red roses She gave him a 
real kiss 
Babbitt may not have won the hearts and minds of the voters in 
New Hampshire finishing sixth among the seven Democratic 
candidates but hes a winner to Hattie his wife Often at his 
side she would reassure him Youre my candidate

It helps to be able to laugh a little especially when youre 
hurting a lot 
While Babbitt came up a loser when the votes were counted he 
wins an award for best selfdepreciating humor 
Example You know a guy came up to me in Des Moines and shook 
his head and said to me Babbitt you were in it right up to the 
very beginning

And you know a candidates gotta do what a candidates gotta 
do 
When Alexander Haig announced his candidacy for the Republican 
presidential nomination in Manchester he praised New Hampshire 
voters for being intelligent and for not falling for campaign 
imagery 
Then he got caught up in it himself flying to the far north 
country to remote but politically famous Dixville Notch where the 
few residents grab a lot of attention in the media every primary 
year by casting the nations first votes 
By the time those ballots went in the box this time though 
Haig had given up his campaign

And its nice to get a little help from your friends especially 
if they are heavy hitters 
Bush brought in some for his campaign He had Ted Williams the 
Boston Red Sox baseball Hall of Fame slugger on his side He also 
had the GOPs Mr Conservative Barry Goldwater the former Arizona 
senator and the partys 1964 presidential nominee in his corner 
And jazz artist Lionel Hampton performed at house parties His 
vibes turned out to be good ones for Bush who found in New 
Hampshire just the note he wanted Victory over Dole
