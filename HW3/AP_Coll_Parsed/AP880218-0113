Accordingly my budget proposes that a number of federal 
enterprises be transferred back to the private sector through 
public offerings or outright sales Following our successful sale 
of Conrail and auctioning of 5 billion in selected loan 
portfolios I am proposing the sale not only of the Naval Petroleum 
Reserves but also of the Alaska Power Administration the federal 
governments helium program excess real property and a further 12 
billion in loan portfolios In addition I have proposed 
legislation to authorize a study of possible divestiture of the 
Southeastern Power Administration and plan to study possible 
privatization of our uranium enrichment facilities as well as ways 
of making the US Postal Service more efficient through greater 
reliance on the private sector Such privatization efforts 
continue to be a high priority of this administration and I look 
forward to acting on the final recommendations of the Privatization 
Commission which I established last September 
Privatization does not necessarily imply abrogation of 
government responsibility for these services Rather it recognizes 
that what matters is the service provided not who provides it 
Government has an inherent tendency to become too big unwieldy 
and inefficient and to enter into unfair competition with the 
private sector 
The federal government should also depend more on the private 
sector to provide ancillary and support services for activities 
that remain in federal hands Therefore I am proposing the 
development of a private mediating institution to reduce the 
backlog of cases before the US Tax Court I propose that the 
private sector be relied upon for booking functions for 
concessional food programs I also encourage the complete 
privatization of wastewater treatment plants certain mass transit 
projects the Department of Agricultures National Finance Center 
and the Rural Telephone Bank 
In addition our administration plans to initiate privatization 
and commercialization efforts involving federal prison industries 
relying on a private space facility for microgravity research 
opportunities in the early 1990s commercial cargo inspection 
military commissaries Coast Guard buoy maintenance and the 
management of undeveloped federal land Moreover my budget 
proposes that the work associated with certain federal employment 
positions be reviewed for the feasibility of contracting their 
responsibilities out to the private sector as yet another way to 
increase productivity reduce costs and improve services 
One of the best ways to test the worth of a governmental program 
or a particular project is to shift some of the cost of that 
program or project to the direct beneficiaries We have done that 
for example with water resources development projects As a 
result local sponsors and users choose to proceed only on the 
projects that are most important and most cost effective
