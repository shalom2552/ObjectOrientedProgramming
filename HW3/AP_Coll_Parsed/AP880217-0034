Former television evangelist Pat Robertson 
showed his strength in statewide precinct meetings that drew a 
record turnout Republican officials said 
The precinct meetings are the first step in the process leading 
up to the Republican national convention in August Those 
participating in the meetings will choose the delegates to go to 
county conventions and discuss what should be in the states 
platform 
Although the delegates eventually chosen to go to the national 
convention will be bound by the result of the GOP primary March 8 
the campaigns want good showings for their candidates at the 
precinct meetings 
Robertson had a good night around the state said Tom Cole 
state GOP chairman In rural areas in the south and east 
Robertson clearly was the winner 
He probably got 60 to 70 percent Thats not large numbers but 
its more than we have had in previous years 
Cole said Tuesday night that party officials didnt know exactly 
how many people attended the meetings but the figure could be as 
high as 28000 compared with between 12000 and 13000 last time 
One Republican official said Monday that Robertson supporters 
had been told to flood the precinct meetings 
We want as many delegates as possible at the convention 
said Tommy Garrett who is working for Robertson in Oklahoma City 
Weve been burned in conventions before We always have trouble 
when we hit the convention floor with the party establishment 
Those attending the precinct meetings selected delegates to the 
county conventions where delegates to the district and state 
conventions are chosen 
Each district will elect three delegates and three alternates to 
the national convention 
The state convention will pick 18 delegatesatlarge and 18 
alternates to the national convention 
Republican county conventions are scheduled for March 5 with 
congressional district meetings March 26 and the partys state 
convention April 16 The national convention is Aug 1518
