Vice President George Bush on Thursday called the 
Super Tuesday series of Republican presidential primaries a crucial 
campaign showdown and said I intend to win 
Capping the first day of his campaign in the southern and border 
states which hold primaries and caucuses on March 8 Bush told an 
enthusiastic crowd There is no way you can become president of 
the United States by not doing well if not winning on Super 
Tuesday 
Bush described whats at stake as he concluded a campaign foray 
into Missouri with a return to his adopted home state of Texas 
Texas is George Bush country Gov William Clements told 
hundreds of Bush supporters massed in the flagbedecked atrium of 
the Loews Anatole Hotel 
Earlier Bush touted Ronald Reagans record in asking Missouri 
voters to give a chance to carry on the legacy that the president 
and I have established over the last seven years 
Weve come a long way under the ReaganBush administration 
Bush told the Texas audience The question now is who is best 
qualified to carry on 
Earlier in Friestatt Mo he surprised customers at a truck 
stop and told one woman Thought you were going to have a quiet 
cup of coffee didnt you 
After visiting several people in the Tin Lizzie restaurant at 
Stos Auto and Truck Plaza Bush carried a cup of coffee himself 
he ordered a small but got a large as he returned to his 
limousine to continue campaigning 
Although Bush in his drive for the Republican presidential 
nomination has repeatedly advertised his loyalty to Reagan he 
gave more emphasis to this part of his basic campaign pitch 
Thursday 
I am proud to have stood with this president through thick and 
through thin and in good times and bad times next to Ronald 
Reagan without cutting and running he said 
Reagan has remained neutral in the race for the GOP nomination 
although he is widely believed to privately favor Bush White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated earlier this week that Reagan 
plans to stay out of the GOP nominating process 
Bush told reporters he was surprised by the size of his victory 
over Sen Bob Dole of Kansas in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday 
when Bush got 38 percent of the vote to Doles 29 percent But Bush 
said he could not crow about elections of the past as he 
concentrates on the balloting still ahead 
Missouri is among the states with events in the crucial round of 
Super Tuesday voting March 8 As he campaigned in the state Bush 
kept his promise to resume the grassroots campaign style he began 
after he finished behind Dole and Pat Robertson in the Feb 8 Iowa 
precinct caucuses 
Many things have improved since the president and I took 
office Bush told a crowd at an elementary school in Monett 
On the same day that Reagan sent Congress a proposed 109 
trillion budget envisioning a 1295 billion deficit for fiscal 
1989 which begins Oct 1 Bush repeated his own proposal for a 
fouryear budget freeze 
Bush said however that his spending freeze would make 
allowances for the rate of inflation and would not freeze in 
expenditures which should go 
Asked as he arrived in Missouri whether he needed a truth 
squad to check out his statements about Dole Bush replied I 
dont think so Im telling the truth I hadnt heard about that 
Im going to keep doing what Im doing here get the message out 
fight hard Feel comfortable on the turf 
Dole has accused Bush of running ads in New Hampshire which 
distorted the senators position on several issues 
In Washington some Republican senators supporting Dole said 
they would go to the Super Tuesday primary states to present what 
they termed a clear and unequivocal picture of Doles record 
Were not going to attack anyone Sen Wrren Rudman RNH 
told reporters who asked if they would criticize Bush for his 
statements about Doles voting record 
Rudman said however that during the late days of the New 
Hampshire campaign some Bush ads criticizing Doles record were 
a misstatement of his record 
Rep Gene Taylor RMo accompanying Bush on the flight to 
Missouri said he thinks Reagans standing in Missouri will benefit 
Bush Weve had a great upswing in Missouri Weve had a great 
rebound in the economy Taylor said 
In an interview Taylor said he had advised Bush Dont get 
into an argument with Bob Dole and Pat Robertson He also said he 
told the vice president he did not think negative advertising would 
be useful 
Without mentioning Bush by name Sen Pete Domenici RNM 
said to say that Bob Dole has been anything but a taxcutter a 
deficitcutter and a fiscal conservative is simply wrong 
Bush also said he would honor his commitment to take part in 
Friday nights Republican candidate debate here despite the fact 
that Dole and Robertson have said they will not participate 
Dole said in Atlanta that the Dallas event would be a pep 
rally for Bush and Robertson spokeswoman Constance Snapp said 
the Robertson campaign did not believe the format would provide a 
fair and equitable discussion of the issues
