Philip Kaufman is a filmmaker who welcomes challenge He took 
Tom Wolfes sprawling paean to the first US astronauts The 
Right Stuff and made a highly original film that deserved better 
than it got at the box office 
Now Kaufman undertakes an even more daunting assignment filming 
Milan Kunderas novel of eroticism and politics in 1960s 
Czechoslovakia The Unbearable Lightness of Being He has 
created a movie in the grand tradition of storytelling It is 
intimate yet epic a compelling human triangle played against the 
cataclysm of the 1968 Soviet invasion 
Tomas Daniel DayLewis is a Prague brain surgeon and a 
tireless womanizer He merely commands take off your clothes 
and women joyfully obey Tereza Juliette Binoche a shy but 
firmminded country girl enters his life and he agrees to marry 
her But his philandering continues 
Sabina Lena Olin a freespirited artist who fears commitment 
as much as Tomas is content to remain his mistress As tensions 
mount in the marriage Soviet tanks roll into Prague to quell the 
growing liberalization Tomas and Tereza flee to Switzerland But 
unhappy with his duplicity Tereza returns to Prague and he 
follows Punished by the authorities for their defection they 
settle on the farm where the story comes to an abrupt end 
The Unbearable Lightness does not lend itself to 
condensation There are too many complexities too much probing of 
human motivations The story requires careful telling and Kaufman 
requires almost three hours Only in the rustic setting does the 
pace falter 
The film is illuminated by two extraordinary performances by 
Juliette Brioche whose Tereza marvelously traces a womans 
emotional and intellectual growth by Lena Olin who manages to 
balance Sabinas sensuality and her aestheticism The sequences in 
which they photograph each other in the nude is a masterful 
celebration of the female form 
DayLewis the amusing young snob of A Room With a View is 
perfect within the confines of the hedonistic Tomas his dark eyes 
smoldering with lust But Kaufman and cowriter JeanClaude Carrier 
never overcome the onesidedness of the character 
Saul Zaentz whose other achievements include One Flew Over 
the Cuckoos Nest and Amadeus produced with superior taste 
All departments are commendable especially Sven Nykvists camera 
work and Leos Janaceks music 
The Orion release is rated R with much female nudity and sexual 
activity Running time 171 minutes
