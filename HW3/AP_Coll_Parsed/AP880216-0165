An American who was the first member of the Irish 
Republican Army to be extradited from the United States was 
convicted Tuesday of gunning down a London policeman in a 
coldblooded killing untinged by any remorse 
William Quinn a San Francisco native was sentenced to life in 
prison by Judge Christopher Rose after a jury returned the guilty 
verdict at the Old Bailey criminal court 
Quinn who pleaded innocent to killing offduty officer Stephen 
Tibble 21 in February 1975 refused to say anything during his 
fiveday trial and showed no emotion as the verdict was read 
He lost a widely publicized fiveyear battle against 
extradition that went all the way to the US Supreme Court 
Rose told Quinn the shooting was an appalling coldblooded 
killing untinged by any remorse on your part and motivated no 
doubt by the terrorist activities on which at that time you were 
engaged 
You shot repeatedly and at pointblank range a man who was in 
fact a police officer though you could not have known he was other 
than an ordinary member of the public the judge said 
Carlene Rohan Quinns US lawyer who testified for the 
defense said Quinn would not have been convicted in the United 
States 
The evidence of identification would not have been permitted 
there she said 
His mother Juanita attended the trial but had no comment on 
its outcome 
The judge accepted a defense plea not to set a mandatory minimum 
sentence which could free Quinn in 10 or 15 years 
Quinn who is of Irish ancestry was living in San Francisco 
when he became an IRA supporter and made trips to Ireland in 1971 
and 1974 court testimony indicated Prosecutors alleged that he 
and four other men were sent to mainland Britain to carry out a 
string of bomb attacks 
A man identified as Quinn was leaving a house in west London on 
Feb 26 1975 when two police officers on a burglary patrol became 
suspicous and stopped him for questioning 
Quinn fled but was confronted by Tibble who was off duty and 
driving by on motorcycle when he stopped to assist the other 
officers Prosecutors charged that Quinn fired two shots into 
Tibbles chest with a handgun 
Quinn was arrested in Ireland on suspicion of belonging to the 
outlawed IRA Police meanwhile arrested Quinnss accomplices 
located the murder weapon and found a bombmaking operation in a 
house near where the slaying occurred Quinns fingerprints were 
found on a road map and other items 
Quinn fled to San Francisco but was arrested in 1981 by the FBI 
on a British warrant setting in motion a protracted legal battle 
that culminated in early 1986 when a US Appeals Court ruled 21 
in favor of his extradition 
He was extradited in October 1986 after the US Supreme Court 
refused to hear his argument that the police shooting was a 
political offense and therefore not covered by the USBritish 
extradition treaty
