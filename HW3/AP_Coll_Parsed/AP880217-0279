A federal judge approved a 25 million 
settlement Tuesday to end a classaction lawsuit brought by former 
owners of Montgomery Ward amp Co catalog stores 
The settlement will affect 852 store owners with the average 
payment totaling 24000 
The owners sued 2 years ago to challenge Montgomery Wards 
decision to stop taking catalog orders from independent store 
operators 
The agreement reached last month shortly before the case 
reached a jury also requires Montgomery Ward a retail chain based 
in Chicago and owned by Mobil Corp to drop countersuits to 
recover nearly 2 million in debts from operators 
The settlement is fair reasonable and completely adequate 
considering the hazardous litigation US District Judge 
Clifford Scott Green said in approving the settlement Tuesday It 
is clear to this court that a jury could have found in favor of the 
defendants 
He also said only about 20 former owners objected to the 
settlement and the objections centered on the distribution of the 
settlement an issue to be handled later 
The opposition included two former store owners who testified 
Tuesday 
Thomas Imerito of Wysox Pa and Frank Logue of Montrose 
Pa said they doubted their payments would cover their costs 
Their attorney Albert Slap of Philadelphia said he will appeal 
The assignment of the distribution could split the class into 
warring factions and this kind of opposition reflects on the 
fairness of the settlement he said 
Harold Cohen a Philadelphia attorney representing most of the 
plaintiffs lawyers asked the judge to set an immediate hearing on 
lawyer fees He suggested a payment of 35 million plus 500000 
in expenses 
The judge said he would decide the issue later possibly after 
agreement is reached on dividing the 25 million
