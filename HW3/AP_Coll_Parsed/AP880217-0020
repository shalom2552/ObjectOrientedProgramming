Vice President George Bush said reports of his death had been 
greatly exaggerated His comeback may get the same treatment 
Thats the way it is in the crucial highstakes doordie 
makeorbreak pickacliche contests that begin the season of 
competition for presidential nominations Every state leaves an 
indelible imprint until the next state votes 
That sometimes means as long as a week 
The early omens circa 1988 point to a season of political 
trench warfare in which battle cries and claims to momentum yield 
to a long hard struggle to collect delegates one state at a time 
then one vote at a time until they add up to a nominating majority 
One week after he became the Republicans leading loser Bush 
gained a solid comeback victory in the New Hampshire presidential 
primary Tuesday 
Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis third among Democrats in 
Iowa won easily in nextdoor New Hampshire and said that put him 
on a winning path that leads South 
Sen Bob Dole claimed satisfaction in second place but it was 
way before midnight when he stopped smiling and started snarling at 
Bush 
Rep Richard Gephardt the Democratic victor in the Iowa 
caucuses said runner up and 20 percent of the vote was a solid 
showing and it was to the extent that he out paced fellow 
Midwesterner Paul Simon for the second week running This isnt 
helping the Illinois senator said in bowtied understatement 
Sen Simon polled 17 percent three points and a good many 
dollars short Simon said if he could have reversed that narrow 
edge it would have made a tremendous difference in raising 
money which is in dangerously short supply in his campaign 
For all of that nobody was quitting outright not even former 
Arizona Gov Bruce Babbitt who got 5 percent and barely beat Gary 
Hart Babbitt said hed talk with his supporters and figure out 
what to do next 
So coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire both political parties 
have confirmed what they knew going in Bush is the man to beat in 
what looks like a twoway Republican contest with Pat Robertson 
looking from the outside in 
The Democrats have yet to pick a face from the crowd Dukakis 
has what edge there is because he is the most recent winner but he 
is heading into difficult territory in the Southern primaries that 
come up on March 8 Super Tuesday A victory next Tuesday in 
Minnesota would provide an undeniable boost 
To this point for all the effort and money they have spent the 
contestants have succeeded in eliminating Alexander Haig from the 
Republican running and pushing Democrat Babbitt toward the exit 
Neither of them had a chance in the first place 
Robertson who embarrassed Bush in Iowa slumped to last place 
in New Hampshire The former television evangelist acknowledged 
that hed come up short of his hopes but said he wasnt 
discouraged My natural base is down in the South and thats 
where we go from here Robertson said 
Rep Jack Kemp ran third with 13 percent He said that made him 
the winner in the competition to become the candidate of the 
conservative wing of the party Or as he later billed it the 
progressive conservative wing He too said the South promised him 
a better lot 
Pete du Pont ran narrowly ahead of Robertson 
Democrats Jesse Jackson and Sen Albert Gore Jr said they too 
were aiming southward The black vote there is certain to boost 
Jacksons showings Gore decided to wait near his Tennessee base 
for the rest of the field to come there Super Tuesday is a 
completely new ball game he said 
But it is a game in which there will be enough conflicting 
messages to enable most of the contestants to claim headway All 20 
contests are not in the South Dukakis Massachusetts and next 
door Rhode Island will be holding primaries on March 8 among the 
halfdozen outside the Southern and border states
