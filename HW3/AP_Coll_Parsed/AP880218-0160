Federal felons can take some heart from 
President Reagans 1989 budget proposal Presidential pardons and 
commutations are projected to rise dramatically this year and next 
In 1987 there were only 23 pardons and no commutations of 
sentence But the budget anticipates 50 pardons and five 
commutations in this fiscal year which began last Oct 1 and an 
additional 50 pardons and five more commutations in the 12 months 
beginning next Oct 1 
Pardon Attorney David C Stephenson was not immediately 
available for comment on the reasons increases are anticipated 
Many political figures and legal observers have suggested Reagan 
may pardon some of his former White House aides who participated in 
the IranContra affair and are expected to be indicted this year by 
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh Reagan has refused to discuss 
such pardons and his aides have said such discussions are premature 
By comparison there were 55 pardons in 1986 and no 
commutations Denials and requests for pardons or commutations not 
acted upon remained steady at 290 in both 1986 and 1987 There was 
no immediate explanation for the drop in pardons in 1987
