An inventor who claims he has devised a 
machine that produces more energy than it uses says he will appeal 
a judges refusal to force the government to give him a patent for 
his invention 
I am pleased the judge has finally ruled because I am counting 
on getting up to the higher court Joseph W Newman said 
Wednesday after US District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson 
rejected his lawsuit against the US Patent and Trademark Office 
I was very certain he was going to be consistent and rule 
against me said Newman 51 of Lucedale Miss 
Jackson upheld the Patent Offices refusal to grant a patent for 
the device saying there was insufficient scientific evidence to 
support Newmans claim the machine converted matter into energy 
Patent examiners rejected Newmans application after ruling that 
such a machine would violate the second law of thermodynamics That 
law of physics holds that energy is inevitably consumed by any 
mechanical process so that a machine cannot produce more energy 
than is used to power it 
The same law rules out the existence of similar socalled 
perpetual motion machines that some inventors have claimed at 
various times to have produced 
Newman and his attorney John Flannery contended that Jackson 
had improperly rejected the findings of courtappointed expert 
William Schuyler himself a former patent commissioner that the 
machine worked as Newman claimed it did 
We have an expert who agrees with our view and we have a 
district court judges opinion that differs with that Flannery 
said So I think we will have to go the Court of Appeals for a 
tiebreaker 
Ruling on the fiveyearold lawsuit Jackson said Newman had 
only produced evidence to support his theory that was anecdotal 
and largely qualitative rather than quantified measured data 
Nor had Newman the judge found rebutted the findings of the 
National Bureau of Standards which tested the machine and 
concluded The device did not deliver more energy than it used 
Newman who has demonstrated his motor to a congressional 
subcommittee claims that it converts matter he calls gyroscopic 
particles into energy 
But the judge found that aside from Newmans own somewhat 
metaphysical writings which appear at multiple points throughout 
his patent application there is no evidence whatsoever from 
which to find the existence of such gyroscopic particles their 
observable or measurable release or reaction within the 
device 
Newmans machine resembles an ordinary electric motor except for 
a large coil of wire used to create an electromagnetic field when 
powered by batteries 
At best the judge said the evidence supports a finding 
that Newmans device will operate for reasons not explained at all 
but must be merely guessed at on dry cell batteries for longer 
periods of time than others which may or may not be comparable 
But such a device is not the one for which Newman seeks a 
patent Jackson said in his 20page opinion He is unequivocal 
in his insistence that the device he has tendered as patentworthy 
produces more useable energy output than the energy required to 
power it The court finds the evidence of it insufficient 
The bitterly fought lawsuit included a 1986 episode when 
Flannery was cited for contempt of court for pressing Newmans 
demand that Jackson disqualify himself from the case because he was 
biased 
I have had just about enough of your insolence in this case 
the judge told Flannery Jackson later withdrew the contempt 
citation
