Trial opens Tuesday for a former Conrail 
engineer accused of 16 counts of manslaughter by locomotive in 
Amtraks worst fatal crash a January 1987 accident that killed 16 
people and injured more than 170 
Rick L Gates was operating three linked Conrail locomotives 
that prosecutors say ran a stop signal in Chase Md on Jan 4 
1987 and ended up in front of an Amtrak passenger train that was 
traveling about 120 mph 
Federal investigators say Gates 33 failed to notice the stop 
signals because of drug and possibly alcohol use Gates has denied 
smoking marijuana while operating the train 
Testimony likely will focus on drug use warning whistles and 
lights in the cab and a series of approach signals to the switch 
where four tracks converge to two at the Gunpowder River railroad 
bridge crossing 
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday in Baltimore County 
Circuit Court for Gates trial on 16 counts of manslaughter Each 
count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a 
1000 fine 
A county grand jurys indictment accuses Gates of Essex Md 
of gross negligence in the operation of the locomotives 
Gates charges fall under the same law normally used against 
people accused of negligence in automobile accidents Prosecutors 
have said this is the first time the manslaughter by locomotive 
statute has been used in Maryland 
Gates who worked for Conrail for 14 years has said signals 
indicated he should slow down and proceed through the switch 
But the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that 
Gates failed to notice track signals or emergency warnings in the 
cab because he was impaired by marijuana and possibly alcohol 
Blood tests taken immediately after the accident showed both 
Gates and brakeman Edward Cromwell had traces of marijuana in their 
bodies but a recent court ruling in a different case could hamper 
prosecutors 
The men were tested under a Federal Railroad Administration rule 
requiring urine or blood samples of any worker involved in a 
serious accident but the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco ruled last week that such tests are unconstitutional 
The railroad administration has said it will appeal and the 
rulings effect on the trial remains uncertain It stands as 
official precedent only in the circuit courts area but may affect 
judicial thinking elsewhere 
Even if the evidence is allowed prosecutors must prove Gates 
was impaired by the drugs not just that he was using them 
The trial could have implications for government control over 
train operators and for more than 294 million in civil suits 
arising from the crash The railroad administration has said the 
crash already has helped it in its battle for jurisdiction over 
licensing and training of engineers 
The federal government had no authority to punish Gates or 
Cromwell both of whom resigned from Conrail Cromwell has been 
granted immunity and is expected to testify that he and Gates 
fabricated a story to cover up their marijuana smoking on the train 
Defense attorneys according to chief public defender Donna 
Shearer will try to discredit Cromwell by pointing out he ran from 
the scene while Gates stayed to help save lives 
Gates attorneys also say they will present evidence that the 
track signals often malfunction contrary to official statements
