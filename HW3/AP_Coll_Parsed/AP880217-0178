Megahit moviemaker Steven Spielberg was 
snubbed again Wednesday by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences as a nominee best director although his Empire of the 
Sun earned six nominations 
Spielberg the top moneymaking director of all time but never a 
winner for best director was out of town and presumably has no 
reaction said Chris Kelly his spokeswoman at Amblin Productions 
Spielberg was nominated for direction in Jaws Raiders of 
the Lost Ark and ET The ExtraTerrestrial 
Five years ago ET The ExtraTerrestrial the 
biggestgrossing movie in history did not win either for best 
picture or for Spielbergs direction 
Then two years ago and after such smashes as Jaws Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind ET and the Indiana Jones 
adventures it seemed Hollywoods establishment would embrace The 
Color Purple a drama fraught with social significance 
However Spielberg was not nominated for his direction though 
the Directors Guild of America voted its 1985 bestdirected film 
prize to Spielberg and The Color Purple 
This year Spielberg was in distinguished company among the 
overlooked 
James L Brooks was nominated for producing the bestpicture 
nominee Broadcast News and for writing it but not as director 
The directors branch of the Academy neglected Spielberg and 
Brooks to reward five foreigners Britishers Adrian Lyne Fatal 
Attraction and John Boorman Hope and Glory Italian 
Bernardo Bertolucci The Last Emperor Canadian Norman Jewison 
Moonstruck and Swede Lasse Hallstrom My Life as a Dog 
Nominations for the 60th Academy Awards included other notable 
omissions besides those of Spielberg and Brooks Pioneering star 
Lillian Gish was overlooked for The Whales of August 
Steve Martin won critical raves for his performance in 
Roxanne but neither his performance nor the script he adapted 
from the play Cyrano de Bergerac won an Academy mention The 
manic Robin Williams won a nomination rare for a flatout comedy 
performance for Good Morning Vietnam 
Academy voters also resisted the highpressure campaign for 
Nuts Stars Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfus werent among 
the nominees Also among the missing John Lone The Last 
Emperor Elaine Stritch September Maggie Smith The 
Secret Passion of Judith Hearne Faye Dunaway Barfly and 
director Hector Babenco Ironweed 
The Academy Awards return to the Shrine Auditorium on April 11 
after a 40year absence The ceremonies will be televised on the 
ABC network
