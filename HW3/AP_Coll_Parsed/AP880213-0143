Some 1500 women who spent two days discussing 
how they could secure the Constitutions blessings of liberty 
were urged to become more active in politics and to run for 
elective office 
It was no accident that the event was sandwiched between last 
weeks Iowa presidential caucuses and Tuesdays New Hampshire 
primary said Linda Kurtz Hallenborg a member of the symposiums 
executive committee 
This is a way to highlight the fact that we need to get more 
women involved in politics she said in an interview Friday We 
need to make it clear to the presidential candidates that we make 
up 53 percent of the electorate and womens issues need to be 
taken seriously 
Those attending the symposium included US Supreme Court 
Justice Sandra Day OConnor 1984 vice presidential candidate 
Geraldine Ferraro Coretta Scott King widow of slain civil rights 
leader Martin Luther King Jr syndicated newspaper columnist Erma 
Bombeck and former New York congresswoman Bella Abzug 
The twoday symposium on Women and the Constitution at the 
Carter Presidential Center was convened by former first ladies 
Rosalynn Carter and Lady Bird Johnson 
In speeches and seminars women who attended the event that 
ended Friday heard that political power could be their best hope to 
achieve equality in other fields besides politics 
They also heard that the Constitution as originally drawn up 
200 years ago deserved criticism as unfair to women and minorities 
Our criticism of the unamended Constitution is not intended to 
be divisive said Mrs King Some people apparently feel that 
blacks and women should join in an uncritical celebration of a 
document that protected the slave trade and denied women their 
democratic rights 
Sixtyeight years after the ratification of the 19th Amendment 
which guaranteed women the right to vote women make up just 14 
percent of the higher statewide political officeholders around the 
country according to the National Womens Political Caucus 
There are 23 women in the US House and two in the Senate Two 
women are governors of states 
Both Ms Ferraro and Mrs King urged women to run for office and 
continue working in other campaigns Ms Ferraro described a 
ripple effect that she discovered when her 1984 campaign 
generated thousands of letters from women whom her candidacy had 
inspired 
Its the young woman writing after the election Ive decided 
to go to medical school because of you Ms Ferraro said Its 
the 7yearold writing from her school in Minnesota Someday Im 
going to run for president 
If you dont run you cant win 
While Ms Ferraro spoke of a future in which women will share 
equally in the political landscape Ms Hallenborg said the present 
administration and a return to traditionalism by some women has 
slowed down the womens movement 
I think the Reagan presidency has been extremely detrimental 
to the progress we have made she said Every president up to 
Reagan made progress in bringing women into power 
The 1988 elections represent an opportunity for women to 
reassert themselves at the ballot box and the outcome could 
determine whether eight years of Republican conservatism has 
splintered the womens equality movement for good Ms Hallenborg 
said 
This is a clarion call that women need to rise up and be 
counted in the political process she said
