Michael Dukakis the winner of the New 
Hampshire Democratic primary set the stage for a debate with his 
rivals tonight by talking tough on military policy and promising a 
hard line on terrorism 
Dukakis traveled south Wednesday touting positions aimed at 
satisfying more conservative voters And he tossed a few pointed 
barbs at Tennessee Sen Albert Gore who has staked his entire 
campaign on doing well in the South 
The governor was to spend part of today back at the 
Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston and travel to Dallas for a 
faceoff with the other Democrats 
Facing the inevitable question about whether he is too liberal 
Dukakis said at a news conference I dont understand these 
labels Im a guy whos supposed to be a liberal from the 
Northeast Ive balanced nine budgets in a row Ive cut taxes 
five times in the last four years Weve cut crime 
In Atlanta Dukakis said he wanted to strengthen the nations 
conventional forces and crack down on terrorism He challenged his 
Democratic rivals to outdo him on toughness 
I dont yield on toughness to Al Gore in any shape or 
manner Dukakis said 
Later in Florida Dukakis fired another shot across Gores bow 
when told that Gore had accused his opponents of being alienated 
from the electorate 
Mr Gore left Iowa virtually left New Hampshire Dukakis 
said I dont know whos alienated 
The governors message was not entirely hardline In the 
Clearwater press conference he stated flatly Im not going to 
cut social programs I for one am not going to balance the 
budget on the backs of poor people 
He also said he would keep the defense budget at about its 
current funding To cut the federal deficit he said as he has 
throughout the campaign that he would institute an aggressive tax 
collection program 
Florida is of critical importance to the Dukakis campaign 
Dukakis said it may offer his best opportunity to win one of the 
southern states on Super Tuesday 
Speaking to about 600 cheering supporters in this Gulf coast 
community Dukakis said If three weeks from now with your 
help we can do well in Florida were going to be on our way to 
the White House 
The idea that the South is politically different from the rest 
of the nation is false Dukakis said 
Theres a mythology about the South as if its some kind of 
foreign country Its nonsense he said 
Campaign aides say Dukakis will focus his economic opportunity 
message on states with the most electoral votes And he will drive 
home his points with the biggest campaign war chest of any of the 
Democratic candidates 
Former Kentucky Gov Martha Lane Collins and former New Orleans 
Mayor Dutch Morial endorsed Dukakis in his Atlanta appearance 
Massachusetts Rhode Island Washington Florida and Maryland 
are states where Dukakis is expected to do well on March 8 Others 
like Alabama Texas Kentucky South Carolina and Georgia wont 
come to the Dukakis fold as easily as New Hampshire his aides 
acknowledge 
Bostonbased political consultant Michael Goldman said Dukakis 
campaign sources tell him the governor will spend between 3 
million and 4 million in the South
