One of three brothers who were banned from 
school because they had been exposed to the AIDS virus has 
developed AIDSrelated complex but his doctor says he can remain 
active 
Ricky Ray 11 does not have a severe or lifethreatening 
illness stemming from acquired immune deficiency syndrome said 
Jerry Barbosa a specialist in pediatric hemotology and oncology at 
All Childrens Hospital in St Petersburg Rickys ARC is stable 
and he is showing no signs of progession said Barbosa He 
never posed a threat of spreading the AIDS virus in the past and 
he doesnt pose a threat to anyone in the present 
If anything Ricky is feeling better Barbosa said Hes 
full of energy 
Rickys brothers 10yearold Robert and 8yearold Randy 
remain in good health Barbosa said All three are hemophiliacs 
Gail Lloyd a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta said a patient who has ARC does not necessarily 
develop AIDS a fatal disease that destroys the bodys immune 
system 
ARC is caused by the AIDS virus and has a specific set of 
symptoms Barbosa said Those symptoms often less severe than 
symptoms of AIDS may include weight loss loss of appetite fever 
night sweats skin rashes diarrhea tiredness lack of resistance 
to infection or swollen lymph nodes 
The AIDS virus is transmitted by sexual contact sharing 
intravenous needles or by receiving a transfusion of infected 
blood Doctors believe the Ray brothers were injected with tainted 
plasmabased medication they received to clot their blood 
Information about Rickys condition came seven weeks after it 
first was reported that he was taking AZT a drug approved for the 
treatment of AIDS 
The boys medical records are on public file as part of a 
lawsuit filed against the DeSoto County School Board by their 
parents Louise and Clifford Ray Barbosa filed the latest test 
results in court Friday 
The doctor said he prescribed AZT because early use of the drug 
should increase the chance of retarding ARC symptoms 
The Ray brothers were banned from regular classes in DeSoto 
County in August 1986 after they tested positive for AIDS 
antibodies A federal judge ordered their return to the classroom 
Less than a week after they started school last fall a fire 
destroyed the Rays home Authorities ruled the fire arson but no 
arrests have been made 
The Rays moved to Sarasota where the boys now attend school
