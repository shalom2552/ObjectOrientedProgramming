The local businessmans most recent appearance at an Exchange 
Club meeting was Thursday when members gathered at a Newport Beach 
restaurant to present him with a Perfect NonAttendance Award 
Im usually busy in the middle of the day and cant find time 
to come here Crean explained 
Then he pointed out that he really didnt deserve the award 
Actually he said I was here once 10 years ago so its 
not really perfect nonattendance

Rock music fans are used to standing in 
long ticket lines for big concerts but this week its the late 
playwright Eugene ONeill whos causing waits of an hour or more 
Its pretty unusual Yale Repertory Theatre Press Director 
Robert Wildman said Friday 
The Yale Rep is presenting two ONeill plays Ah 
Wilderness and Long Days Journey Into Night both starring 
Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst from late March through May 21 
The plays presented in celebration of the 100th anniversary of 
ONeills birth may go on to New York City and the Soviet Union 
Since tickets went on sale Monday ticket buyers have had to 
wait between an hour and an hour and a half Wildman said When 
ticket booths opened Monday more than 75 people waited in a line 
that extended onto the sidewalk and around a corner and the waits 
for some were more than two hours 
Since the performances were announced last August eager 
playgoers have been asking about tickets some calling from as far 
away as Texas Wildman said 
Directing Long Days Journey is Jose Quintero who also 
directed Robards and Dewhurst in the 1973 Tony Awardwinning 
revival of A Moon for the Misbegotten another ONeill play 
Robards 1956 performance in ONeills The Iceman Cometh 
also under Quinteros direction launched him to stardom The 1956 
production also popularized the play largely ignored for the 10 
years after its debut
