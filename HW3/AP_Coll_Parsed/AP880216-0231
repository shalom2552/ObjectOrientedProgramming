Sales of existing homes held steady in 1987 at 
close to 4 million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the 
October stock market collapse a national real estate trade group 
reported Tuesday 
The National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing 
singlefamily homes and condominiums totaled 3885 million units 
last year down a slight 03 percent from the 1986 level of 3897 
million units Sales in both years were the fastest pace of this 
decade 
Alaska and Lousisiana two states which had suffered a big slump 
in sales because of depressed energy industries enjoyed a rebound 
last year leading the country along with Massachusetts with the 
largest percentage gains 
Meanwhile the average price of an existing home rose to a 
nationwide median of 84300 at the close of last year an increase 
of 51 percent in 1987 slightly ahead of the rise in consumer 
prices the association said 
New York City and Boston maintained their rankings as the most 
expensive places to buy homes while Providence RI and Hartford 
Conn had the biggest percentage price gains out of 53 
metropolitan areas surveyed 
The median price of an existing home averaged 180800 in New 
York City and 178600 in Boston during the final three months of 
the year At the other end of the scale the most affordable 
housing was in Des Moines Iowa where the median sales price was 
52000 
The Northeast which has been a hot real estate market for 
several years had the four top cities in terms of percentage price 
increases Home prices were up 322 percent in Providence 217 
percent in Hartford 20 percent in Washington DC and 182 
percent in Albany NY 
Fourteen cities in the survey concentrated in depressed energy 
and farm areas of the country saw home prices decline during 1987 
The biggest price drop was 72 percent in Houston followed by a 56 
percent decline in Oklahoma City 
In all 22 states enjoyed sales increases in 1987 led by a 262 
percent surge in sales in Alaska and identical increases of 188 
percent in Louisiana and Massachusetts Alaska and Lousiana were 
both rebounding from big sales declines in 1986 while the 
Massachusetts increase followed a sizable 1986 advance 
Also enjoying big gains were Georgia with an 185 percent 
increase and North Dakota and Maine with advances of 179 percent 
and 143 percent respectively 
The Northeast continues as the strongest region but we saw 
considerable strength in the South and Midwest two areas which had 
been lagging the rest of the country said John Tucillo chief 
economist for the realtors group 
Twentytwo states suffered sales declines last year led by a 
138 percent drop in Washington state Sales fell off 133 percent 
in Virginia followed by declines of 97 percent in both Maryland 
and Oklahoma Sales were off 95 percent in the District of 
Columbia 
Analysts said that one factor which pushed up 1986 sales was a 
lastminute rush to close sales and reap capital gains profits 
before the new tax law took effect on Jan 1 1987 
Tuccillo predicted that price increases nationwide should be 
lower than the 51 percent rise in 1987 with sales expected to 
decline by around 8 percent in part because of slower economic 
growth 
Tuccillo predicted that the Northeast will continue to have the 
highest home prices of any region but he said the rate of increase 
should slow 
A leveling off is occurring after a long period of overheated 
activity he said The losses incurred by those in the New York 
financial community are still having a lagging effect on home 
buying in that area
