Dart Group Corp says it will press its 
billiondollar buyout bid for Stop amp Shop Cos despite a unanimous 
rejection of the offer by the Stop amp Shop board of directors 
Our offer is still outstanding Dart President Robert Haft 
said Thursday following the rejection of the offer Our offer is 
to the 90 percent of the shareholders who are not on the board 
In rejecting the offer the Stop amp Shop board said the 103 
billion buyout a bid of 37 a share was inadequate and not in the 
best interests of the company or its stockholders 
Among the boards considerations was information that Dart has 
yet to secure commitments to provide financing for its offer Stop 
amp Shop said in a statement Stop amp Shop also said it was exploring 
alternatives to the unsolicited offer including a possible sale of 
the firm 
A company statement said Stop amp Shop had received indications 
of interest from third parties for a transaction with the company 
But Haft said Dart was prepared to compete for Stop amp Shop 
If there is a higher bona fide alternative to our offer we 
intend to bid against it Haft said in a telephone interview 
Stop amp Shop said its other alternatives included exploring a 
leveraged buyout recapitalization or other restructuring In a 
leveraged buyout investors borrow heavily to purchase a company 
and then pay off the debt with the companys cash flow or the sale 
of its assets Stop amp Shop which operates 141 supermarkets and 171 
Bradlees department stores around the country has said publicly it 
prefers to remain independent 
The statement referred to Darts history of making millions of 
dollars in profits through failed takeover bids Many analysts 
doubt that Dart is sincere in wanting to acquire and operate a 
retail company 
Haft denied his company had made its offer solely to profit from 
its Stop amp Shop holdings The Dart Group has acquired 738220 
shares of Stop amp Shop 27 percent of the outstanding shares 
Haft said Dart had begun the process under which it could call a 
special meeting of Stop amp Shop shareholders for the purpose of 
replacing the companys board with directors more sympathetic to 
the offer 
Stop amp Shop stock fell 50 cents Thursday to 3687 a share in 
New York Stock Exchange trading Announcemennt of the rejection 
came after the close of trading 
Haft and his father Herbert the chairman of Dart had offered 
31 a share for the retailer and earlier this week raised the bid 
to 37 
In Hartford Conn officials at Local 919 of the United Food amp 
Commercial Workers Union said Thursday they have retained a team 
of lawyers investment bankers and other advisers to explore the 
workers options in the face of the Dart bid 
The union also requested a meeting with Stop amp Shop directors 
We are exploring all and every appropriate alternative to 
protect the interests and jobs of the employees we represent 
said local president Arnold F Espinosa 
Among the options being considered are seeking a white 
knight a suitor sympathetic to the employees interests and an 
employee stock ownership plan in a possible leveraged buyout 
Espinosa said 
The Hartford local which represents 10000 Stop amp Shop workers 
is leading the effort on behalf of other locals Stop amp Shop has a 
total of 35000 workers
