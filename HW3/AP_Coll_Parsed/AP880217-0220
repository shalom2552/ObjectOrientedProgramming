Republican presidential aspirant 
Pat Robertson insisted again Wednesday that he believes there are 
Soviet missiles in Cuba but added he has no firsthand knowledge 
of their existence 
In my opinion they are there Robertson told questioners at 
a news conference here as he arrived on a campaign swing through 
Florida 
But he later allowed he was not trying to start another Cuban 
missile crisis 
Robertson initially brought up the topic during a New Hampshire 
debate when he disagreed with Vice President George Bush over new 
USSoviet intermediaterange nuclear forces pact Robertson said 
the treaty should be extended to include Cuba which he contended 
still had Soviet missiles 
The White House issued a quick denial and Robertsons 
Republican rivals criticized his statement as inflammatory and 
untrue 
Later Robertson aides said the candidate did mean to say 
missiles with nuclear warheads 
Wednesday Robertson was asked if he considered his statements 
irresponsible and responded heatedly 
Its not irresponsible one bit he said raising his voice 
Its a lousy treaty 
He said he had cited US Sen Jesse Helms a prominent member 
of the Ssenate Foreign Relations Committee and other committee 
sources in saying that there had been violations by the Soviets of 
an agreement made in 1961 to keep missiles out of Cuba 
Since he first made his comments on missiles Robertson said he 
had received more reports about nuclear missiles in Cuba He did 
not identify the sources of the reports 
Robertson who received 10 percent of the vote in Tuesdays New 
Hampshire Primary said he expected to do very well in Southern 
states voting in the March 8 Super Tuesday primary 
Earlier in the day Robertson campaign in South Carolina which 
holds its priamry March 5 three days before Super Tuesday and 
called it the key to the nation 
Theres no sense in playing games Robertson told reporters 
If I lose this one then Im in trouble 
He said he had these words for frontrunners Bush and Bob Dole 
Meet me in South Carolina and then well have the contest 
Were telling everybody to fasten their seat belts and get 
ready state Republican Party Chairman Van Hipp said Theres 
going to be a whole lot of campaigning in South Carolina in the 
next couple of weeks
