Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev criticized 
Britain and other Western European countries Tuesday for what he 
called a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement to 
eliminate intermediaterange missiles 
Gorbachev met with Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe of 
Britain who defended Britains nuclear policy at a news conference 
in the Soviet capital 
While generally approving the INF treaty the leaders of NATO 
countries have been acting as though the situation in Europe since 
its signing had only worsened Gorbachev said according to a 
report by the official Tass news agency 
Otherwise it was impossible to explain the latest wave of 
praise for the nuclear deterence strategy plans for socalled 
compensation all manner of projects for the joint manufacture of 
newest weapons the FrancoWest German military rapprochment and 
so forth Gorbachev said 
The Soviet leader also said Britain had grown less enthusiastic 
about a chemical weapons ban and that the West was dragging its 
feet at a conference in Vienna to work out a format for new talks 
on conventional forces in Europe 
Gorbachev Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T Yazov and other 
Soviet officials regularly have criticized European leaders after 
the Dec 8 superpower summit for urging the modernization of their 
weapons systems to make up for the loss of US Pershing 2 and 
cruise missiles in Europe 
In East Germany the official news agency ADN reported Tuesday 
that the Soviets had begun dismantling intermediate nuclear 
missiles 
Howe at a news conference after his meeting with Gorbachev 
defended Britains policy of keeping and modernizing its nuclear 
force 
Peace has indeed been upheld in the past 40 years by the 
nuclear deterrent Howe said The deterent resoures available 
need to be kept up to date to be modernized 
Modernization is not a euphemism for circumventing the INF 
treaty he added 
Gorbachev and President Reagan signed an agreement in December 
to eliminate their medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles from 
Europe as well as the rest of the globe The two sides now are 
trying to negotiate a 50 percent cut in their arsenals of 
longrange weapons 
The USSoviet agreement is awaiting US Senate approval In 
the Soviet Union the treaty has been approved by the ruling 
Communist Party and must be passed by the Supreme Soviet which is 
expected to give its endorsement
