Irans president told a visiting Soviet 
official the United States and its allies may try to gain influence 
in Afghanistan after the Soviet Union withdraws its troops a news 
agency reported today 
Tehrans Islamic Republic News Agency monitored in Nicosia 
said President Ali Khamenei met Tuesday night with the Soviet 
Unions deputy foreign minister Vladimir Petrovsky 
During the meeting Petrovsky handed Khamenei a letter from 
Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev which touched on Afghanistan and 
other issues the report said Petrovsky left for home today 
ending a sixday visit to Tehran 
Khamenei IRNA reported told Petrovsky that Iran was pleased 
with Gorbachevs policy on Afghanistan and renewed a call for the 
speedy withdrawal of Soviet forces from that country nine years 
after their intervention 
Gorbachev issued a statement Feb 8 saying the Soviet Union 
would begin withdrawing its 115000 troops May 15 if indirect talks 
between the Pakistan and Afghan governments produce an accord at 
least 60 days before that 
Gorbachev also stated for the first time that a pullout would 
not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a 
transitional Afghan regime which would oversee such a pullout 
IRNA quoted Khamenei as telling Petrovsky that Iran was higly 
pessimistic about the US concern over Afghanistan and sees no 
sincerity in its US stance Therefore any plan for the 
countrys Afghanistans future must prevent influence of the 
United States and its Western allies The United States supports 
the Moslem rebels fighting the Afghan government 
IRNA said the two officials also discussed bilateral relations 
SovietIranian relations have been improving steadily 
especially since Moscow torpedoed US efforts to impose an 
international arms embargo on Iran to force it into a settlement of 
the 7yearold war with Iraq 
Moscow however has backed UN Security Council Resolution 
598 which was adopted unanimously last July The ceasefire 
resolution was accepted by Iraq but Iran insisted the Baghdad 
government should be condemned as the aggressor and punished before 
any settlement of the conflict is achieved
