Cereal factory worker David Rouch 
says hes suffered years of gossip malicious pranks and the cold 
shoulder because of a local newspapers report of what turned out 
to be a unjustified arrest 
He sued the police departments that took him into custody and 
settled out of court for 4000 plus attorney fees But he also 
contends the Battle Creek Enquirer should pay 
Rouch is seeking 1 million in a suit that has triggered a major 
upheaval in Michigan libel law 
He presented his side of the case to a jury last week and the 
newspaper gives its side this week 
The case has given Michigan a new standard for determining when 
private citizens can sue over news reports on items of public 
interest because the state Supreme Court decided that Rouchs case 
should be heard by a jury 
The court ruled that the fact that the newspaper didnt print 
false information knowingly or with reckless disregard for the 
truth was not enough to clear it of liability 
The states highest court said the right to report on official 
proceedings doesnt extend to arrests that fail to result in formal 
charges and that the decision of whether damages are owed should 
be based on evidence of negligence rather than malice which is 
more difficult to prove 
The Enquirer is refraining from outofcourt comment on the 
case But a year ago after the state Supreme Court acted 
newspaper attorney Alice Neff Lucan suggested all Michigan 
newspapers could have a more difficult time monitoring police 
activities 
The power of arrest is the most serious power the government 
has over us she said If we are not able to cover that it 
raises all kinds of ugly specters about what the police can do 
without it appearing in the newspapers 
Rouchs attorney John Jereck rejects that reasoning He 
maintains that the newspaper could have reported on the attack of a 
sleeping baby sitter without printing the name of the man taken 
into custody 
He also faults the newspaper for failing to follow up and write 
about the dropping of preliminary charges against Rouch and the 
arrest of a second suspect The charges cited at the time of his 
arrest were never brought formally because the case was dropped 
before Rouch was arraigned 
They dont practice what they preach Jereck said Isnt 
the public interested in knowing when the police make a bad arrest 
That wasnt reported 
Because of the appeals and high court deliberations more than 
eight years have passed since the newspaper published what seemed 
to be a routine sixparagraph account of the arrest of a man 
suspected of raping a teenager who was caring for his exwifes 
children 
Rouch was booked fingerprinted read his rights He got out of 
jail on a personal recognizance bond and was told when to show up 
for arraignment 
But the prosecutors office opted not to press charges and 
because his name was in the newspaper Rouch contends hes been 
branded a rapist 
Now the jury must determine whether the newspaper story was 
false and whether it was published without reasonable care 
Rouchs attorney tried to convince the jury that the story 
falsely accused him of raping a 17yearold baby sitter 
The newspaper in presenting its side will try to convince the 
jury that the 1979 article didnt accuse Rouch of committing a 
crime but merely reported accurately an arrest as reported by 
police 
Witnesses testifying in Rouchs behalf said they had presumed 
him guilty because they saw his name in print 
One woman told the jury she refused to let her daughter join 
friends at the Rouch home I connected him with the rape of a 
teenage girl Sonya Weiss testified 
A former classmate testified he was startled to see Rouch 
walking the streets and said he had assumed he was behind bars 
That classmate never saw the story printed nearly a year after 
the arrest saying Rouch had been cleared and another man arrested 
in the case That article was published after a Rouchs attorney 
threatened legal action 
They thought I was a rapist Rouch testified adding that he 
lost sleep and became more reclusive 
I more or less just stayed home he testified I thought 
it was best for the children I drank more for a while than I 
normally did 
A Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist Washington and Lee 
University professor Clark Mollenhoff criticized the newsgathering 
practices of the newspapers police beat reporter He said the 
newspaper should have waited two or three days before printing the 
story 
The newspaper will have its own expert witnesses this week

University of Missouri at Columbia journalism school dean Roy
