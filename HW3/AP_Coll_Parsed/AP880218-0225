A hospital patient on a respirator died in a 
flash fire that enveloped the oxygen apparatus Wednesday the Fire 
Department said 
The 26yearold victim whose identity was not released 
suffered from AIDSrelated pneumonia said Howard Rubenstein a 
spokesman for Downtown Beekman Hospital 
The fire remained confined to the respirator but forced the 
evacuation of 26 patients in the intensive care unit and patients 
from elsewhere in the hospital Rubenstein said No other injuries 
were reported 
A shortcircuit in the respirator may have ignited the oxygen 
fire officials said 
Nothing else around the respirator burned said Fire 
Department spokesman Lt Frank Martinez The bed was not 
burned in any way We really have no idea of what killed the 
patient actually 
Thick black smoke enveloped the thirdfloor intensive care unit 
and extended down to the first floor Rubenstein said
