The chiefs of the Republican and Democratic 
national parties told Congress Wednesday that they support 
increasing the amount of federal money spent on presidential 
transitions 
The bill would increase to 35 million the government 
assistance that goes to a presidentelect to begin making 
arrangements for a new administration The original 1963 law 
provided 900000 which was increased to 2 million in 1976 
Advocates have complained that 12 years of inflation have made that 
insufficient 
The scope and complexity of activity required for an efficient 
transition has increased significantly over the years Paul Kirk 
chairman of the Democratic National Committee told the Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee 
He said new presidents must immediately begin filling more than 
3000 executive appointments and preparing a federal budget for 
presentation to Congress within three months 
Under the legislation the federal money would go to the major 
parties which would be reimbursed for transition tasks they 
perform Both party leaders voiced approval of this mechanism 
Frank Fahrenkopf chairman of the Republican National Committee 
said the national parties have the facilities and equipment to do 
transition work efficiently and that the job would reinforce 
their traditional role of providing personnel and support for their 
candidates 
Sen John Glenn DOhio chairman of the committee said that 
even if the financing increase is approved the money provided 
might still be too low 
I wish we could say it will cover this thing he said I 
doubt that it will 
The legislation would require public disclosure of the sources 
and use of privately donated transition money and provide for 
reimbursement to each political party of up to 200000 for 
transition work performed before the general election
