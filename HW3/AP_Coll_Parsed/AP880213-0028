ramp for less than 10 seconds at the Pensacola Civic Center waved 
to about 300 cheering fans and then darted back inside 
It was the publics only chance to glimpse the reclusive 
entertainer since he arrived Monday to rehearse through Feb 18 for 
a 13city tour scheduled to start Feb 23 in Kansas City Mo 
It didnt even last two seconds Im so disappointed said 
Stephanie Puddle one of three 18yearold fans from Toronto who 
said they spent every dime they had to travel here in hopes of 
seeing Jackson 
A husbandandwife disc jockey team Doug and Denise Daniels 
had gone on a hunger strike for two weeks and collected thousands 
of names on a petition to persuade Jackson who has been rehearsing 
in front of 10000 empty seats to hold a public performance here 
before leaving 
It has been to no avail so far although the Daniels did get a 
call praising their effort from Jacksons publicity agents
