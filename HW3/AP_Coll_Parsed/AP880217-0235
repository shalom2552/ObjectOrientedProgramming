The Arizona Senate on Wednesday granted 
Gov Evan Mecham a oneweek delay of his impeachment trial set to 
begin Monday 
The action came on a voice vote Earlier in the day the Senate 
defeated two motions for delay offered by the embattled governors 
attorney Murray Miller 
Arizonas chief justice Frank Gordon who will preside at the 
impeachment trial told the Senate a oneweek delay would 
ultimately save time by allowing some issues to be settled 
beforehand 
However Sen Majority Leader Bob Usdane said There is an 
ongoing fear that this will be the beginning of lots of motions 
for continuation by Miller 
Miller had asked that the trial be put off until criminal 
charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan are adjudicated He 
contended that an impeachment trial would prejudice the criminal 
trial jury 
But a motion to delay the trial until 20 days after the criminal 
case is resolved lost on a voice vote and a motion to delay the 
Senate proceeding a flat 90 days went down 245 with five 
Republicans supporting the governor 
After the oneweek delay passed Miller would not say whether he 
would go to court in an effort to obtain a further delay He told 
the Senate on Tuesday that if the trial was not delayed he would 
go to state or federal court 
Before the two earlier votes Wednesday Senate Majority Leader 
Bob Usdane a Republican had said I think we need to expedite 
the trial 
Minority Leader Alan Stephens agreed saying His Millers 
game is delay Thats his middle name 
At least 72 people are considering challenging Mecham in a 
recall election May 17 including a former congressman and a former 
state school superintendent who lost to the Republican in 1986 
The House impeached Mecham on Feb 5 and accused him of 
concealing the 350000 loan misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership and trying to 
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state 
official 
Wednesday was the first day for recall election candidates to 
file petition signatures aimed at getting placed on the ballot 
Mecham will automatically be put on the ballot but all other 
candidates must file 3336 signatures of registered voters by March 
18 
By midday Wednesday nobody had turned in any petition 
signatures but 72 had picked up packets to collect signatures 
The most prominent names among them are those of Democrat 
Carolyn Warner who lost to Mecham in a threeway gubernatorial 
race in 1986 and former Rep John Rhodes who planned to announce 
Friday whether he would run 
But some of the lesser knowns among the prospective candidates 
also insist they have a shot at unseating Mecham 
Dave Colosimo of Phoenix a former teacher and musician said 
If I didnt think I could win I wouldnt run He has never 
sought public office before and admitted his campaign thus far was 
a oneman show 
Frank Vaupell a Phoenix mortgage loan officer acknowledged he 
has no real chance of winning Asked why he was running he said 
I shouldnt be Theres probably much more qualified people 
Republican national committeeman Jack Londen also said he will 
run so voters will have a choice of a conservative candidate in 
case Mecham is barred from running in the recall If Mecham is 
convicted by the Senate lawmakers could vote to bar him from 
holding any future public office 
Londen said he would pull out if Mecham stays on the ballot
