A somber nation marked the 1000th day of captivity 
Tuesday of journalist JeanPaul Kauffmann but neither French nor 
Iranian officials offered much hope that the hostage would leave 
Lebanon soon 
Marathon runners carried a large chain to symbolize Kauffmanns 
captivity during a 1000kilometer trek from Brittany in northwest 
France to a barge on the Seine where politicians and loved ones 
called for Kauffmanns release 
It is important that the captors know that all of France is 
united his wife Joelle 
I came here to express my solidarity said Human Rights 
Minister Claude Malhuret 
The Newspaper Guild of America the Praguebased International 
Organization of Journalists and the Journalists Committee for the 
Liberation of French Hostages in Lebanon all issued statements 
appealing for the freeing of Kauffmann and other captives 
The education ministry asked that the statement by the French 
group be read in classrooms 
But the name of another hostage Middle East researcher Michel 
Seurat abducted with Kauffmann on May 22 1985 was barely 
utteredThe Shitte Moslem group Islamic Jihad which claimed the 
abductions announced March 5 1986 that Seurat had been executed 
Seurats wife Mary asked that his name no longer be mentioned 
in nightly newscasts that count off the hostages days of captivity 
We would like even more to be close to them to tell them to 
hold on that nothing will be neglected and nothing is President 
Francois Mitterrand said on television 
But it is so hard so difficult in the face of this pitiless 
act to arrange that JeanPaul Kauffmann and our other Frenchmen 
held hostage be freed one day 
Kauffmann 43 a reporter for the newsweekly Evenement du Jeudi 
and Seurat were taken hostage as they drove from the Beirut airport 
following Kauffmanns arrival 
Two other French hostages diplomats Marcel Carton 64 and 
Marcel Fontaine 45 kidnapped March 22 1985 have passed their 
1000th days as captives 
Terry Anderson chief Middle East correspondent for The 
Associated Press is the longest held of the 22 foreign hostages in 
Lebanon He was captured March 16 1985 
Six French hostages most of them held by the Organization of 
Revolutionary Justice have been freed since conservative Premier 
Jacques Chirac came to power in March 1986 
In each case France thanked Iran which has influence over the 
groups holding Westerners captive 
Iranian Vice Minister Ali Reza Moayeri in a French television 
interview Tuesday said that Iran was not to be counted on for the 
freeing of more hostages 
Iran benefits from a very important influence in Lebanon 
that can be used to free Western hostages including French but at 
a time when we have satisfying relations with France Moayeri 
said 
For the moment diplomatic relations being broken between our 
two countries no move in favor of the hostages can be undertaken 
France severed relations with Iran on July 17 after a dispute 
over an embassy employee who refused to submit to questioning about 
a series of bombings in Paris 
Never would we have imagined seeing the 1000 days said 
Kauffmanns mother Odette I never thought myself capable of 
facing such a test
