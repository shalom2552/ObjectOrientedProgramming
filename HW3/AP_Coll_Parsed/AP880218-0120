These efforts are described in greater detail in my Management 
Report which is being submitted concurrently They can succeed 
only if all federal managers and employees work together 
Therefore I propose in this budget a new approach to paying 
federal employees who increase their productivity I ask the 
Congress to modify the current system of virtually automatic 
withingrade pay increases for the roughly 40 percent of 
employees eligible each year to one that is based on employee 
performance This will give federal employees stronger incentives 
to improve service delivery and reduce costs to the taxpayer

As I have stressed on numerous occasions the current budget 
process is clearly unworkable and desperately needs a drastic 
overhaul Last year as in the year before the Congress did not 
complete action on a budget until well past the beginning of the 
fiscal year Th Congress missed every deadline it had set for 
itself just 9 months earlier In the end the Congress passed a 
yearlong 1057page omnibus 605 billion appropriations bill with 
an accompanying conference report of 1053 pages and a 
reconciliation bill 1186 pages long Members of Congress had only 
3 hours to consider all three items Congress should not pass 
another massive continuing resolution and as I said in the State 
of the Union address if they do I will not sign it 
I am asking for a constitutional amendment that mandates a 
balanced budget and forces the federal government to live within 
its means A constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget 
and a provision requiring a supermajority vote in the Congress 
to increase taxes would impose some muchneeded discipline on the 
congressional budget process Ninetynine percent of Americans live 
in states that require a balanced state budget and a total of 32 
states already have passed resolutions calling for a convention for 
the purpose of proposing a balanced budget amendment to the US 
Constitution 
Also I am asking the Congress for a lineitem veto so that my 
successors could reach into massive appropriation bills such as the 
last one cut out the waste and enforce budget discipline 
Fortythree state governors have a lineitem veto the president 
should have this power as well As governor of the state of 
California 19671975 I used the lineitem veto 943 times The 
California State legislature upheld each of these vetoes even 
though both Houses were controlled by the opposition party 
In addition I propose the following further reforms to the 
budget process 
1 Joint budget resolution The budget process has so 
degenerated in recent years that the presidential budget is 
routinely discarded and the congressional budget resolution is 
regularly disregarded As a remedy I propose that henceforth the 
Congress and the Executive collaborate on a joint resolution that 
sets out spending priorities within the receipts available The 
requirement of a presidential signature would force both branches 
of government to resolve policy differences before appropriations 
measures must be formulated The budget process could be further 
improved by including in the budget law allocations by committee as 
well as by budget function 
2 Individual transmittal of appropriation bills The current 
practice of transmitting fullyear continuing resolutions skirts 
appropriations committeesubcommittee jurisdictions More 
importantly it does not permit the legislative and executive 
branches to exercise proper scrutiny of federal spending 
Therefore I propose a requirement that appropriations bills be 
transmitted individually to the president
