Insurance companies have reported that many 
AIDSrelated claims were based on physical conditions that existed 
before the policies went into effect and therefore should be 
restricted or denied a survey says 
The report released Wednesday by the Congressional Office of 
Technology Assessment also determined that screening of health 
insurance applicants to detect the AIDS virus is common among 
insurance companies and health maintenance organizations 
The OTA report said that while the number of AIDS cases reported 
by various companies ranged up to 3000 most insurers had 
reimbursed no more than 10 AIDSrelated cases 
Twelve commercial insurers and three Blue Cross plans reported 
that 10 percent or more of their AIDSrelated cases were linked 
with a preexisting condition for AIDS 
Two of the 12 commercial insurers reported that more than half 
their AIDSrelated claims were based on preexisting conditions 
Almost half the commercial insurers surveyed 21 out of 44 
reported no preexisting AIDSrelated cases among their AIDS claims 
Fortyfive of the 61 companies surveyed reported having AIDS 
claims 
A preexisting condition is one that exists before an insurance 
policy goes into effect and which would cause an ordinarily prudent 
person to seek diagnosis care or treatment 
The issue is being thrashed out in the courts the study said 
At present there are several court cases pending relating to 
what comprises a preexisting condition for AIDS and the alleged 
refusal by insurers to pay for AIDSrelated claims based on a 
policys preexisting condition provision it said 
OTA said its survey of commercial insurers Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield plans and HMOs found that most insurers ask AIDSrelated 
questions on applications and require health histories from an 
applicants physician 
The report said 51 or 86 percent of the 62 commercial insurers 
who responded to the survey either screen or plan to screen 
individual applicants for infection with the AIDScausing HIV virus 
Fortyone already do and another 10 plan to start the tests 
Eleven of 15 Blue Cross plans surveyed either screen or plan to 
screen as do eight of 16 responding HMOs 
Thirtyone of the 62 commercial carriers said they routinely 
test applicants for HIV antibodies while one of the 15 Blue 
CrossBlue Shield plans did and two of the HMOs did 
The survey found that there is a difference however in how 
insurers judge someone to be at risk of AIDS as opposed to being at 
risk of contracting other diseases In addition to evaluating 
medical criteria 18 of the 62 commercial insurers said they 
consider sexual orientation in determining risk of contracting 
AIDS as did four of the 16 HMOs surveyed 
As of Jan 25 1988 AIDS had been diagnosed in 51916 
Americans of whom more than half or 28965 have died since 1979 
according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta No one is 
known to have recovered from AIDS
