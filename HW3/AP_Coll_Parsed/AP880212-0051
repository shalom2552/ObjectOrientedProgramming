Iraq said Friday its air defenses shot 
down an unmanned Israeli surveillance plane over Iraqi territory 
near the border with Saudi Arabia 
In Israel the military command said it had no information about 
such an incident and an army spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said I believe we will not have any information 
The official Iraqi News Agency monitored in Cyprus quoted a 
military statement as saying the remotecontrolled aircraft was 
launched by the Zionists to jam Iraqi air defenses and monitor 
data for the hireling Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini regime 
Iraq and Iraq are locked in a 7yearold war and often accuse 
each other of receiving Israeli aid 
Iraq said its air defenses destroyed the craft at 544 pm 
Thursday near Al Maaniyah a small outpost 185 miles southwest of 
Baghdad on the SaudiIraqi border It said the plane was launched 
from the occupied Arab territories a reference to Israel and 
Israelioccupied territories 
The agency gave no further details It did not say what weapons 
were used to down the plane 
In Israel a senior military source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said I think this report is rubbish He expressed 
doubt that an Israeli drone could reach Iraqi territory It would 
have to fly about 430 miles to get to Al Maaniyah 
The report was believed to be the first of an Israeli intrusion 
into Iraqi air space since Israeli jets destroyed an uncompleted 
Iraqi nuclear power station in 1981 
Israel has pioneered development of radiocontrolled 
reconnaissance craft but these have usually been used on 
relatively short missions The Israelimade Pioneer unmanned 
surveillance aircraft has a range of 115 miles Two other 
Israelimade drones the Scout and the Mastiff have a range of 62 
miles and 84 miles respectively 
The craft look like oversized model airplanes They carry 
cameras sometimes including TV cameras that help their distant 
pilots steer the craft to their objectives 
The United States has been testing unmanned surveillance craft 
in the Persian Gulf
