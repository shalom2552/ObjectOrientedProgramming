The aging N Reactor shut down amid safety 
concerns prompted by the Soviet nuclear accident at Chernobyl will 
be placed in indefinite cold standby the Energy Department 
said Tuesday 
The decision means that the reactor which for 25 years has 
produced plutonium for the nations nuclear arsenal will be 
mothballed next year after the completion and testing of 100 
million in safety improvements 
Lawmakers said Congress is expected to go along with the 
decision which is included in President Reagans proposed spending 
plan for the next fiscal year The budget is to be presented to 
Congress on Thursday 
About 2600 workers will eventually lose their jobs at the 
reactor located at the Hanford nuclear reservation in central 
Washington state 
Sen Dan Evans RWash said that the ripple effect from those 
layoffs could eventually result in a total of up to 7000 people 
loosing their jobs in the TriCities Spokane Yakima and the 
Seattle area 
Energy Secretary John Herrington said the decision to close the 
reactor was a result of a review of the nations future need for 
plutonium conducted by the Department of Defense 
Under cold standby status fuel will be removed from the 
reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued the DOE 
said 
The reactor could be cranked up if the demand for plutonium 
increases but a restart could take up to three years to complete 
The N Reactor has been a key part of our national security 
complex for more than 20 years and those who have been associated 
with it can be proud of its contribution to the security of the 
United States Herrington said in a statement 
Herrington said DOE was committed to a sensitive orderly 
transition It is the goal of the department to do everything 
possible to assist those people who will now need to find new 
jobs 
The N Reactor is one of four DOErun reactors that produce 
plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons The other three located 
at the Savannah River complex near Aiken SC are running at 50 
percent power because of safety concerns 
The N reactor was shut down in January 1987 for safety 
improvements prompted by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the 
Soviet Union The N Reactor is similar in design to that Soviet 
reactor although US officials said it was considerably safer It 
is operated for the Energy Department by Westinghouse Inc 
The announcement ends months of speculation about the future of 
the N Reactor The decision was reached following meetings that 
involved Herrington Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci James 
Miller director of the Office of Management and the Budget and 
White House chief of staff Howard Baker 
As recently as December DOE officials had told Congress that 
the reactor would probably be restarted this spring 
But Herrington said it was decided that plutonium produced by 
the three Savannah River reactors along with the recycling of 
plutonium from retired nuclear weapons could meet demand 
Evans and Morrison who blamed budget cuts for the decision 
said they were disappointed But they said at least the 
department would finish the safety improvements and not shut the 
reactor immediately Layoffs would thus come gradually 
If there is any good news in this and there isnt much that 
is it Evans said 
Both Evans and Morrison said they would push for expanded 
funding for the cleanup of highly radioactive defense waste at the 
Hanford reservation and also for the conversion of a mothballed 
Washington Public Power Supply System nuclear plant at the Hanford 
reservation into a new defense production reactor
