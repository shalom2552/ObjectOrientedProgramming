Toymaker Mattel Inc on Friday posted 
losses of 1007 million for the fourth quarter and 1132 million 
for the year with virtually all the red ink accounted for by 
restructuring costs 
The maker of Barbie dolls Hot Wheels and other toys also 
disclosed it has trimmed its headquarters staff by 22 percent over 
the last year to 1720 workers from 2200 
Mattels troubles reflect a malaise in the toy industry that 
persisted through much of last year 
The companys 1007 million deficit for the three months ended 
Dec 26 compared with a loss of 269 million the previous year 
Revenue was off by 14 percent to 2338 million from 2719 million 
The most recent period included 618 million in restructuring 
expenses and debt restructuring costs 
For the full year the companys deficit of 1132 million 
compared to a loss of 83 million in 1986 came on a 37 percent 
decline in revenue to 102 billion from 106 billion 
The 1987 results included 96 million in restructuring expenses 
Last month in the wake of a bitter strike at its production 
facility in Manila Mattel announced it would close that plant and 
pull out of the Philippines 
Mattel which does all of its manufacturing overseas shifted 
the Philippines work to elsewhere in the Orient That action was 
not a factor in the companys restructuring which dealt only with 
changes at the companys headquarters
