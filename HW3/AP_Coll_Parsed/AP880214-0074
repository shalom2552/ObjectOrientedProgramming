A high school teacher in suburban Chicago 
has devised a computer service that produces a teenagers 10 most 
compatible classmates when they punch in answers to 33 questions 
But Sandra Pryz says she does not guarantee fireworks and 
candlelight 
Its just an icebreaker an excuse to talk to someone Theyre 
at an age when theyre not sure of themselves said Pryz who 
teaches at Willowbrook High School in Villa Park and lives in 
nearby Elmhurst 
Thousands of questionnaires are processed each year she added 
especially at this time of year 
We kind of go crazy right around Valentines Day she said 
The matchups produce some interesting reactions according to 
students 
My No 1 was like a nerd said Kristin Liszkowski a senior 
at Willowbrook 
Hes a real brain and Im more the average Joe Schmo I 
would never go for him but it made me feel good that I was matched 
up with interesting kinds of people she said 
Julie Synovic senior class president at ZionBenton High 
School said she didnt know her top match and was not particularly 
interested once she found out more about him 
But it was a good topic of conversation she said Like 
Youre on my list oh wow we must have something in common 
Pryz and her partner Dan Burgess started Computer Daze five 
years ago as a way for schools to raise money They charge 60 cents 
per list Schools charge students about 2 for the rankings and 
keep the profit Pryz said 
The forms students fill out include questions like What is the 
worst thing a teacher can do What would you do if you found 100 
What absolutely turns you off And how do you feel when a teacher 
criticizes you in class 
The questions have no double meaning Pryz said Some kids 
have asked us to put in What will and wont you do on the first 
date First base Second base But we wont do that 
Pryz said computer dating has none of the stigma in high schools 
that it sometimes has with adults 
The kids scream and shriek when they open the letters said 
Pryz 
She offers the service on a nationwide basis too she said 
Its a big thing for a few weeks said Synovic who has 
participated in the computer matching program for the last four 
years 
We joke about it said Wayne Harrison a junior at 
ZionBenton I never do anything with my list I dont even know 
my No 1 girl but the whole thing does give you something to talk 
about during lunch
