Police used electric prods to break up 
thousands of opposition supporters demanding free elections 
Saturday the eve of an election that government leaders said 
President Alfredo Stroessner will win by a landslide 
We are sure the number of votes cast on Sunday for President 
Stroessner and Colorado Party candidates will not be less than 80 
percent of the total said Sabino Montanaro interior minister 
and president of the ruling Colorado Party during a news 
conference Saturday 
Stroessner a 75yearold army general has governed since 1954 
longer than any other head of state in the Western Hemisphere 
The governments predictions contradicted a poll by the National 
Catholic University and West Germanys Friedrich Naumann Foundation 
of 18000 urban voters 
The poll indicated 43 percent favor Colorado candidates 31 
percent said they will abstain from voting and 116 percent plan to 
cast a blank vote Balloting is required by law among Paraguayans 
aged 1860 
About 14 million of the countrys 37 million population are 
registered for the election Voters are to choose a president 36 
senators and 72 deputies who form the twohouse Congress 
Voting was scheduled for 7 am to 6 pm at 7192 polling 
places All sports and social events are banned during the 
balloting 
Police used electric antiriot prods and tear gas Saturday to 
break up a rally of 5000 antigovernment demonstrators in front of 
the National Pantheon which contains the remains of the countrys 
heroes 
Roman Catholic radio station Radio Caritas said the 
demonstrators included Domingo Laino president of the Authentic 
Radical Liberal Party not recognized by the government In a 
brief speech Laino described the elections as a new farce and 
new fraud 
But the people want freedom and we will continue making 
demands in spite of the regimes savage bullies said Laino who 
police had held under house arrest for two days last week 
The radio said no one was arrested although several suffered 
slight injuries 
Colorado Party leaders meanwhile made lastminute calls for 
voters in this landlocked Californiasized nation to turn out en 
masse Sunday to reelect Stroessner to an eighth straight term 
Its a shame Stroessner cant be elected for life said 
Central Bank President Cesar Romeo Acosta at a rally in Raul 
Arsenio Oviedo 250 miles east of Asuncion He represents the 
greatness the splendor the freedom and the independence of 
Paraguay 
Sen Luis Maria Vega of the Liberal Party and Rep Carlos 
Ferreira Ybarra of the Radical Liberal Party are running against 
Stroessner but men admitted they have no chance of winning 
The party winning the majority of votes takes twothirds of the 
Congressional seats The remaining third is divided proportionally 
between the two other parties 
Stroessner seized power in a May 1954 coup that ended nearly two 
decades of political chaos in Paraguay The US State Department 
in its 1987 human rights report released Wednesday said 
Paraguay has not had a democratic government since its 
independence in 1811
