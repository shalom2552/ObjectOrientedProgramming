In another sign of eroding support for 
the Austrian president a leading industrialist has suggested that 
Kurt Waldheim step down because of the controversy over his World 
War II record 
Herbert Krejci general secretary of the Austrian Industrialists 
Association said the fate of the country is even more important 
than the office of president 
Vice Chancellor Alois Mock at a news conference Wednesday 
rejected as not important Krecjis remarks made a day earlier 
on national television Krejci is a member of the conservative 
Peoples Party which is headed by Mock and which backed Waldheim 
for president in 1986 
The chancellor runs the government and the presidency is a 
largely ceremonial post in Austria The Socialists are the senior 
partner in the coalition government with the Peoples Party 
The national leadership of the Peoples Party has scheduled a 
meeting Thursday at which it is expected to discuss the Waldheim 
case 
Last week a commission of historians questioned Waldheims 
moral integrity saying he was in close proximity to Nazi 
atrocities when he served as a lieutenant in the German army during 
World War II but did nothing about them 
Though the panel said it found no evidence Waldheim had 
committed war crimes it concluded he tried to cover up his 
involvement in the war which was disclosed nearly two years ago 
during the presidential campaign 
Waldheim 69 a former UN secretarygeneral has said he is 
innocent of wrongdoing and has refused to resign 
The tabloid Kurier which represents the conservative partys 
relatively liberal economic and business wing has said at least 
twice in the past week that the party is weighing a plan to put 
more pressure on Waldheim to resign 
It did not describe the plan 
The Socialists have said that if Waldheim steps down they are 
willing to work with the conservatives to choose a replacement 
candidate agreeable to both parties 
Meanwhile a group of prominent Austrian intellectuals and 
liberals vowed to hold weekly demonstrations against Waldheim until 
March when the country marks the 50th anniversary of Hitlers 
annexation of Austria 
The discord in the coalition over the Waldheim affair has led to 
increased discussion of the possibility of new parliamentary 
elections Mock and Heinrich Keller the Socialist party secretary 
said Wednesday they opposed new elections
