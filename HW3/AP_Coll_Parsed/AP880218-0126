President Reagan has signed legislation 
designating Tuesday of this week as Lithuanian Independence Day 
saying the United States will never recognize the forcible 
incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union 
In a proclamation signed last week Reagan said Lithuania 
enjoyed political and religious freedom for all citizens 
following its declaration of independence on Feb 16 1918 
Then in June 1940 the year after the signing of the 
MolotovRibbentrop Pact the Soviet Union invaded and illegally 
occupied Lithuania and the other Baltic States the president 
said 
The United States unequivocally condemned this violation of 
national sovereignty and national integrity and ever since then 
our policy has remained consistent We have never recognized the 
forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union and we 
never will Reagan said 
Police and civilian auxiliary officers prevented Lithuanians 
from celebrating the 70th anniversaru of their shortlived 
independence on Tuesday and activists said four Lithuanian 
nationalists were put under house arrest 
Thirtytwo US senators have written to Soviet Leader Mikhail 
S Gorbachev asking him not to interfere with planned 
demonstrations and religious services this week in the Soviet 
republics of Lithuania and Eastonia
