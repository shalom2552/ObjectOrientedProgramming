Waldemar Ferreira was the only bus 
driver to brave the winding mountain road up from Rio in a driving 
rain on Feb 5 a Friday night But he wanted to be with his 
family for dinner 
It was to be his last 
Ferreira almost didnt go It had been raining hard since the 
previous Monday and there were no signs it would let up Petropolis 
always gets rain during the South American summer but this was 
twice as much as normal 
Just after sunset Ferreira climbed aboard the bus and began the 
route he had driven for 40 years He was 64 now getting close to 
retirement 
At 11 pm Ferreira finally pulled into the Petropolis bus 
station 40 miles north of Rio and the 60 passengers applauded It 
was raining harder 
A few minutes later Ferreira dashed up the steps of his 
fiveroom 70yearold concrete house that was nestled piggyback on 
the side of a treecovered hill on Casimiro de Abreu Street His 
wife was waiting for him along with his daughter Sonia her two 
children and his daughter Maria and her husband Andre Fernandes 
At 1115 pm Ferreira sat down to dinner Maria and her 
husband said good night and left for their own nearby house It was 
the last time they would see each other 
Fernandes learned afterward that a concerned friend had called 
his fatherinlaw to see if all was well Fernandes said his 
fatherinlaw told the caller he thought he heard a strange loud 
noise then he hung up It was 10 minutes to midnight 
At that precise moment two lovers in a Volkswagen Beetle 
outside were exchanging a goodnight kiss 
Two houses away preparations were under way for a Sweet 16 
birthday party on Saturday Relatives of the birthday girl had come 
all the way from neighboring Minas Gerais state to decorate the 
house and make snacks 
In another house Maria Ismenia Aleixo was putting her 
9yearold son Carlinhos to bed and was preparing to go to bed 
herself Her mother father and sister already were asleep 
Then their world fell in 
The noise Ferreira heard was a mudslide It got louder as tons 
of water and wet earth raced down the slope and slammed into the 
houses on Casimiro de Abreu Street with such force that their 
concrete shells seemed to explode The avalanche destroyed houses 
cars and furniture leaving only a slicksurfaced mass grave 
Ms Aleixo ran outside as soon as she heard the noise She 
looked up at the wall of mud looming above her and screamed Then 
she too was buried in the reddishbrown slime 
I heard an incredible noise like an airplane taking off I 
rushed to my gate in time to see electric wires exploding and power 
posts toppling at the end of the street said Nair Hoelz a 
longtime resident who lived nearby 
People began screaming for neighbors along the hillside to 
turn on their car lights Then all we could see was mud where eight 
homes had been 
On Sunday Feb 9 rescue workers pulled Ms Aleixo and two 
neighbors alive from the mudcovered rubble where fallen beams had 
left enough space for pockets 
There were no other survivors on Casimiro de Abreu Street 
I didnt have time to grab my son or even to think Ms 
Aleixo 42 said from her hospital bed Im a single mother My 
son was my whole life My joy came from watching him grow up 
Over an eightday period rescue crews using tractors along 
Casimiro de Abreu Street found softdrink bottles a mattress bits 
of clothing three crushed cars and 18 bodies Among them were 
Waldemar Ferreira his wife daughter Sonia and two grandchildren 
He rushed home that night to die Its like something that was 
meant to be said soninlaw Fernandes 33 
The mudslides destroyed more than 1000 houses in Petropolis 
from slum shacks to wealthy residences with swimming pools Civil 
defense officials evacuated 94 areas in 28 neighborhoods and 
condemned 4000 to 5000 houses and apartments 
Carlos Eurico Aragao an engineer who heads Petropolis public 
works department said bad planning and excessive logging were 
reasons behind the disaster He estimated that 80 percent of the 
citys buildings were on unsafe ground and 50 percent of those that 
suffered damage unrecoverable 
This city grew too quickly he said It was not well 
planned even when Brazils former emperors built it in the 1800s 
Petropolis grew from a sleepy royal summer getaway to a popular 
resort for the rich and also a dormitory community for poor 
inhabitants with jobs in and around Rio 
Many in town blamed threeterm Mayor Paulo Rattes for ignoring a 
1978 environmental report that predicted just such a catastrophe 
from deforestation City Hall also was accused of not making needed 
imporvements in drainage shoring up hillsides and relocating the 
most dangerously situated homes principally slum shacks 
Basically this is a social problem one of underdevelopment 
Rattes said in an interview Many people here earn the minimum 
wage equal to just under 60 a month and he said they build 
their houses however and wherever they can 
The mayor estimated total damage at 50 million 
Even while rescuers were searching for dead bodies and it still 
was raining and more mudslides were occurring many in Petropolis 
were reluctant to evacuate to government shelters 
My husband was raised in this house said Jurema Valente 
53 as she tearfully packed her few possessions and finally agreed 
to get out of her threeroom mudbrick house 
I have nowhere else to go and no way to build another house 
This has been my life How could I start again she asked 
Mrs Valente whose husband earns about 50 a month as a 
furniture maker said she planned to return home as soon as the 
rains ended But the city had condemned her street Enchantment 
Street in Portuguese as one of the areas highest risk zones
