The presidential campaigns began turning 
bitter on the final weekend before the New Hampshire primary with 
Jack Kemp denouncing a Pat Robertson commercial as a lie and 
Richard Gephardt saying a Paul Simon ad questions his integrity 
The public schedules of the campaigns were snarled by a massive 
snow storm Friday but the reality that the first 1988 primary will 
end some candidates hopes heated up the rhetoric 
For one Republican Alexander Haig the campaign ended Friday 
as he withdrew in the face of certain defeat 
For one longshot Democrat Bruce Babbitt Friday was the time 
to ask voters to prolong a campaign offering vastly different ideas 
from those of his rivals 
Let me be direct even blunt New Hampshire has the power of 
life or death over my campaign Babbitt told a state party 
dinner I dont expect to win the New Hampshire primary but what 
I do need to do what you need to do is to send a message to the 
rest of America that here in the snowy hills of New England a 
message of courage and challenge and hope was kept alive 
In the final 72 hours before the primary vote begins the 
airwaves in New Hamsphire are filled with campaign commercials and 
those ads started sharp exchanges 
Kemp his chance for at least a moral victory here threatened by 
Robertsons surge demanded that the former television evangelist 
withdraw television commercials and printed fliers that contained 
deliberate distortions 
I cant insist that all candidates abide by Ronald Reagans 
11th commandment not to speak ill of another Republican Kemp 
said in an address to the Conservative Political Action Committee 
in Washington 
But all of us should abide by the Ninth Commandment Thou 
shalt not bear false witness he said to prolonged cheers 
Robertson snowbound in Merrimack NH said This is the 
kind of desperate thing that losers begin to do We didnt put 
out any of this stuff hes talking about 
Four of the Democratic candidates Simon Gephardt Babbitt and 
Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis showed up for a New Hampshire 
state party fundraising dinner Sen Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee 
and Jesse Jackson had planned to be back in the state but could 
not make it due to the snow Former Colorado Sen Gary Hart did not 
plan to attend the dinner 
But the fraternal nature of the evening did not stop the 
bickering 
Turning to Simon and Gephardt Dukakis asked You guys getting 
along Anything I can do to help 
The audience of activists laughed as many understood the 
bickering between the No 2 and No 3 contenders has done nothing 
to hurt Dukakis 
After the dinner the trading of barbs between Simon and 
Gephardt blew up 
Enough is enough on these negative ads Gephardt told 
reporters Paul Simon is running an ad that ought to come off the 
television It impugns my character and my integrity by saying can 
you trust this man 
So to put it very straight enough is enough I asked Sen 
Simon to take those ads off television And if he doesnt he ought 
to take off the bow tie because hes just another politician as 
long as theyre on the Missouri congressman said 
Only moments before Simon had told reporters that drawing out 
the distinctions between the candidates is legitimate 
As long as it doesnt get too acrimonious I think that a 
healthy comparison is good Simon said 
Gephardt promised to renew the exchange at the final debate 
before the primary a confrontation sponsored by the League of 
Women Voters this afternoon at St Anselm College 
The daily polling of the sentiments of the New Hampshire voters 
continued without pause with Vice President George Bush locked in 
a neckandneck race with Kansas Sen Bob Dole 
One survey the ABC NewsWashington Post poll taken Thursday 
night showed Bush with 32 percent to Doles 26 percent Another 
the CBS News poll taken Wednesday and Thursday gave the Kansas 
senator 32 percent to Bushs 29 percent 
The CBS poll was based on interviews with 499 likely GOP primary 
voters and had a sampling error margin of 4 percentage points The 
ABCWashington Post poll interviewed 559 likely Republican voters 
and had a margin of error of 5 percentage points 
In both polls Dukakis maintained a strong lead in the 
Democratic race
