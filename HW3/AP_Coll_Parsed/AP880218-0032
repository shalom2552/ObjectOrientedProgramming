The Chevy Nova or Chrysler Colt hatchback need 
not take a back seat to the Jaguar or Maserati when it comes to 
protecting passengers in that part of the automobile the 
government says

among the rapidly increasing number of vehicles with rearseat 
shoulder harnesses as standard equipment beginning with the 1988 
model year Within two years virtually all cars will have the 
improved safety belts the department said

for not requiring shoulder harnesses for rearseat passengers 
released a survey Wednesday of manufacturers showing their plans 
for installing the equipment 
The push to make shoulder belts available in the rear gained 
widespread attention last year after the National Transportation 
Safety Board suggested that in some accidents laponly belts may 
harm rearseat occupants Momentum was added by a series of 
successful lawsuits 
The department said a proposed regulation to require rearseat 
harnesses in all cars is still under review 
Twentyfour of the 29 manufacturers listed reported that they 
had the rearseat shoulder belts in all or some of their cars this 
model year The exceptions were the Ferrari Isuzu Subaru Suzuki 
and Yugo automobiles Isuzu provides them as an option on 1988 
models 
General Motors Corp reported it has the rearseat shoulder 
belts as standard equipment on 12 car models this year ranging from 
the compact Chevrolet Nova to three types of Cadillac models It 
will put them in all domestic cars next model year according to GM 
spokesman Bill Noack 
The Ford Motor Co which has the belts in its Lincoln 
Continental Merkur and TaurusSable cars this year will have it 
in nearly half its cars in the 1989 model year said Ford spokesman 
Winston Leavell 
Chrysler Corp plans to have the shoulder belts in all its cars 
by the 1990 model year but has them only in the Colt Vista Colt 
hatchback and Eagle Medallion this year 
Toyota has the rearseat harnesses in its Cressida and Camry 
this year but offers them as an option in other models Nissan has 
them only in its Maxima this year but plans them in all models by 
1990 Honda has them in all Honda and Acura cars and Mazda has 
them in the 323 626 MX6 and 929 models according to the 
department 
The rearseat harnesses also are available this model year in 
the Volkwagen Golf Jetta Quantum and fourdoor Fox Mitsubishi 
Galant and Sigma and all models of the Alfa Romeo Aston Martin
