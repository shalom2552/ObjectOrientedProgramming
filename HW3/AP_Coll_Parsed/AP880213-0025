Hundreds of lonesome lovers are getting a free 
chance to whisper sweet nothings into the ears of sweethearts 
anywhere in America this Valentines Day weekend courtesy of a 
phone company and a hotel 
All that romance stuff is gone Im trying to get it back 
Derek Grier of Los Angeles said Friday as he tried to call his wife 
of five years 
Although he is in Chicago for six weeks for an IBM training 
program Grier said he wants to make this Valentines Day a turning 
point in his marriage 
Im sending flowers for the first time I have to bring the 
fire the sparks the romance back into it he said 
Grier was one of dozens taking advantage of three free love 
lines set up by American Telephone amp Telegraph Co and the Hyatt 
Regency From 10 am to 3 pm today and Sunday the lovelorn may 
talk to their favorite valentine for three minutes at the Hyatt and 
ATampT will cover the costs said Nancy Ruth a hotel spokeswoman 
About 600 people made free calls when the promotion was tried 
for two days last year Ms Ruth said The hotel expects about 800 
calls will be made this year she said 
But as one homesick valentine discovered the offer doesnt 
extend beyond the United States 
I want to call Rome My valentine is there my wife said 
Mario Biasetti 62 who was in Chicago on business 
Biasetti told the women operating the love lines the story of 
St Valentine the third century Italian martyr for whom the 
holiday is named But despite the storytellers charm they 
wouldnt let him call Italy 
A Chicago woman persistently tried to reach her sister and close 
friend in San Diego to tell them her good valentines news 
Linda Calderon opened her apartment door this morning to a 
deliveryman bearing a dozen longstem red roses from a new romantic 
interest 
I was speechless she said 
Others using the three phones set up in the hotel lobby called 
to express a different kind of love 
The only person I can think of to call is my mom said Lee 
Dixon 25 of Los Angeles who is also in the IBM training program 
Carol Pegg who moved from Oregon to Chicago last year used the 
free lines to call some old friends from her hometown 
I would never have called another way said Ms Pegg who 
came across the love lines on her lunch break 
Maria Gonzalez 26 had a lively conversation in Spanish with 
her grandmother in Miami 
I just called to tell her I loved her and wish her a happy 
Valentines Day she said
