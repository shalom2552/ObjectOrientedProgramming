Romania allowed a citizen employed as a UN 
disarmament official to return to his job and family in Geneva on 
Friday after keeping him in his communist homeland for more than 
two years 
Liviu Bota who headed the UN Institute for Disarmament 
Research in Geneva said an error by Romanian authorities 
prevented him from returning after he was summoned home in December 
1985 for urgent consultations 
Speaking to reporters at the airport Friday night he would not 
speculate on why he was let go but said It was an error made at 
some level and its over now Im very happy to be back in Geneva 
He said pressure by UN SecretaryGeneral Javier Perez de 
Cuellar and others had helped 
In New York Mario Zamorano a spokesman for Perez de Cuellar 
said The secretarygeneral on behalf of all the UN staff 
members is very pleased about Botas return 
Bota will retain a directorlevel post but his disarmament job 
has been taken over by another official UN spokeswoman Therese 
Gastaut said 
He was met by his wife Sandra and Jan Martenson director of the 
UN office in Geneva 
Mrs Bota has claimed Romanian authorities put her husband under 
roundtheclock surveillance following him with two cars and 
tapping or periodically cutting off his telephone 
Romanian officials played deaf and dumb insisting that Bota 
had no legal ties with the United Nations or that his UN contract 
was not valid she said in a written statement published in Geneva 
last month 
UN officials intensified efforts on Botas behalf after his 
wife took an overdose of tranquilizers and other pills in May 1986 
Perez de Cuellar made repeated demands for his release and the 
case also was on the US human rights agenda 
John C Whitehead deputy secretary of state met with Bota last 
week during a visit to Romania State Department officials would 
not say whether Whitehead had a role in the release 
When he was called home Bota had been a UN official for 13 
years on loan from his government and had headed the disarmament 
institute since 1980 
President Nicolae Ceausescus government later told the United 
Nations that Bota was resigning his disarmanent post but UN 
officials refused to accept the resignation unless it was submitted 
in person 
He was not allowed to do so and the Romanian government later 
accused him of espionage 
There have been other cases in which UN officials from the 
Soviet bloc were detained during visits to their homelands and UN 
intervention had no effect 
One of the most publicized cases was that of Alicja Wesolowska 
a UN secretary in New York who was detained on a visit to Poland 
She was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1979 on charges of 
spying for a NATO nation that was not identified 
Percy Stultz an East German employe of the Parisbased UN 
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization was arrested in 
March 1980 while visiting his country and convicted of 
antistate activities 
Both Ms Wesolowska and Stultz eventually were freed from 
prison but both have been confined to their contries
