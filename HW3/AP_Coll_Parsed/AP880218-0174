Final testing of any AIDS vaccine might have to 
be done in Africa rather than the United States because the US 
AIDS infection rate is not high enough to determine whether a 
vaccine is working a government researcher said Thursday 
Such final testing of a vaccine would pose a significant 
problem in the United States said Anthony Fauci director of the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and 
coordinator of the governments AIDS research efforts 
Even among homosexual men the rate of new infections is no 
longer high enough to provide sufficient data on a vaccines 
effectiveness Fauci said 
The new infection rate among gay men in San Francisco is so low 
for example that a test of a vaccines effectiveness would take 
eight years and require thousands of volunteers he said 
Fauci testified before the Presidential Commission on the Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic and spoke in a later interview 
Fauci told the commission he was talking about Phase III 
trials which test how well a vaccine prevents infection Current 
experimental AIDS vaccines are in Phase I trials meant only to see 
whether they are safe and whether they spur an immune response The 
next step Phase II aims to find the proper safe dose that gives 
maximum immune system response 
Phase III testing requires the administration of the vaccine to 
healthy people likely to be exposed to the disease These subjects 
are then followed for a period of time to see whether or not they 
contract the disease 
In the interview Fauci said that despite substantial infection 
rates among intravenous drug abusers they are difficult to study 
because they dont come back for followup research once a 
project begins 
Given the situation in the United States Fauci told the 
commission scientists must consider doing Phase III trials in 
Central Africa or elsewhere where the new infection rate is still 
high 
He later said Central America or Haiti are other possibilities 
Fauci said preliminary discussions have begun with the World 
Health Organization and with health officials in Central Africa No 
agreements have been reached he said but the Africans are 
certainly flexible and open to the possibility of holding these 
trials 
He also predicted that no vaccine for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome would be available for general use before 1995 
In separate testimony AIDS expert William Haseltine of the 
DanaFarber Cancer Institute declared nobody can predict with 
certainty that an AIDS vaccine can ever be made 
But he said I remain cautiously optimistic 
A vaccine is a substance that produces an immune system response 
that will fight off infection There are other drugs that attack a 
virus directly 
Haseltine said the AIDS virus evades the diseasefighting immune 
system in several ways including hiding underneath a surface 
coating of sugar that prevents key proteins from being attacked by 
immune system antibodies 
In addition the virus can infect cells and lie dormant giving 
no sign of its presence to the immune system he said 
Even in the absence of a vaccine he said virusfighting drugs 
may soon be harnessed to prevent infection That may be useful for 
scientific and health workers who work with the virus for newborns 
of infected mothers sex partners of infected people and others at 
high risk of infection he said
