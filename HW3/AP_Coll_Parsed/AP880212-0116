The second wave of Oscar hype and hoopla 
begins this week when nominations for the 60th Academy Awards are 
announced with as many publicists attending as press 
Broadcast News The Last Emperor Moonstruck and 
Hope and Glory seem certain to place high in the Wednesday 
nominations judging from critics awards and Hollywood consensus 
The earlymorning announcement will be held at the Beverly Hills 
headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
While reporters phone in stories to their news organizations 
publicists will telephone their clients and bosses with the good or 
bad news and return to their offices to plot the second phase of 
the Oscar campaign 
Campaigning is a dirty word in the industry but most people 
in the movie business do it 
We dont like it but we cant stop it sighs Academy 
president Robert Wise 
The Academy expressed its feelings in a message to members in 
the reminder list of eligible releases You will be importuned by 
advertisement promotional gifts and other lobbying tactics in an 
attempt to influence your vote Each year these crude and excessive 
solicitations embarrass the Academy embarrass you and demean the 
significance of the Academy Award 
Yet this years campaign appears as intense as ever with 
estimates of the total cost run as high as 5 million 
I dont know how much attention is paid to the campaigns by 
the voters Wise said Not much I suspect I know they have no 
influence on my vote I rely solely on my own judgment 
I think the campaigns are justified only to call attention to 
a good film that has been released early in the year Thats the 
only way Im influenced I read about The Tin Men which was 
released earlier in l987 and I said to myself Yeah that was a 
good picture 
You cant influence Academy members said Booker McClay who 
has directed campaigns for Universal Pictures for the past dozen 
years These are professionals who have spent years in the 
business and seen thousands of films You cant hustle them 
The main goal is to get the voters to see your picture You do 
everything possible so they can see it at their convenience 
McClays big push this year is for Universals prestige film 
Cry Freedom which has performed disappointingly at the box 
office in its limited release Since November the film has had 21 
special screenings at the studio theater including those for the 
actors writers and directors guilds Academy members can also show 
membership cards for admission at theaters showing Cry Freedom 
TriStar Pictures took extreme measures to insure exposure for 
Gaby a film about a handicapped woman It has been praised by 
the critics but has failed to attract an audience 
We really really love the film said Peter Silberman West 
Coast publicity vice president for TriStar We felt we needed to 
do something special to make it more available for Academy members 
So we sent out 2500 cassettes of Gaby This is believed to be 
a firsttime event for a film that is still in theatrical release 
The most visible form of campaigning is advertising in the 
Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety Every winter the trade papers 
bulge with ads proclaiming films and filmmakers for your 
consideration One publicist estimates the cost per page at 
5000 including creative color printing and space charges 
Lets face it the trades are our bibles comments marketing 
consultant Lloyd Leipzig The question is How many ads to run 
If you run too few you dont get consideration Too many and 
youre accused of overkill The voter says Theyre trying to buy 
me 
McClay said Universal ran only 14 ads for Out of Africa 
prenominations and the film ended up with the best picture award 
of 1985 On the other hand Orion Pictures bought 65 ad pages for 
Amadeus the best picture winner for 1984 
Publicity plays in important role in Academy campaigns Cher 
for example has recently been on four magazine covers and has 
appeared on most of the important TV talks shows All of this 
brings attention to Moonstruck for which she seems certain to 
be nominated as best actress 
Cher has been very cooperative said John Flinn a publicity 
veteran who is conducting the Moonstruck campaign for MGM We 
also brought Olympia Dukakis to Hollywood for a round of 
interviews Director Norman Jewison has done good work for us 
Even Nicolas Cage who usually doesnt do publicity has agreed to 
some college interviews 
But what does a publicist do when stars wont agree to 
interviews Lloyd Leipzig faces that problem in his campaign for 
Ironweed Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson would do no publicity 
Its a tough harsh uncompromising relentless movie said 
Leipzig of Ironweed which concerns hobo life in 1930s Buffalo 
Not the kind of movie America is into this year 
Its a movie that requires a lot of screenings and not only in 
Los Angeles and New York he said Ive also arranged screenings 
for the 100odd Academy members in London 20 in Paris and 15 in 
Rome 
Studios also promote their films with expensive brochures which 
are mailed to Academy voters Members of the music branch are 
inundated with cassettes and albums of songs and scores 
After the nominations the campaign continues but usually with a 
more dignified tone 
Youve made it this far you dont want to blow it with too 
much hype cautioned one publicist It never works
