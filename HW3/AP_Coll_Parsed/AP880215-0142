Most of the presidential candidates in 
Tuesdays New Hampshire primary were struggling not just to win 
but to avoid losing so badly that it could virtually eliminate them 
from the race 
Democrat Bruce Babbitt who finished a dismal fifth in the Iowa 
caucuses managed a joke about the precarious existence of his 
campaign 
Bruce Babbitt frankly did not start out as a household name 
and some would say hell end this race as not a household name 
the former Arizona governor said at one stop Sunday night 
But for most of his rivals and for those at the back of the GOP 
pack the prospect that the nations first primary could also be 
their last was no joking matter 
Nearly to a man they were vowing to press on no matter what but 
facing the prospect that a resounding defeat in New Hampshire might 
force them to abandon their White House ambitions in the snow just 
as Alexander Haig did on Friday 
George Bush the acknowledged frontrunner here until a 
thirdplace Iowa finish threw a wrench into the gears of his 
campaign machinery has the money and resolve to continue even 
should he sustain a second loss to Bob Dole 
But a primary defeat here would evoke the memory of Walter 
Mondales loss in the Democratic primary four years ago an 
outcome that ensured a long brutal struggle to the convention and 
a nomination that proved worthless 
Democrats Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr campaigned knowing 
they had a ticket to Super Tuesday the next major campaign three 
weeks hence across the South Republican Pat Robertson is sure to 
go on too 
But theres no such assurance for Democrats Gary Hart Paul 
Simon Richard Gephardt and Babbitt who need badly to beat 
somebody Gephardt a winner in Iowa seemed to need a second place 
finish here to sustain a candidacy badly in debt and Simon needed 
the same Michael Dukakis governor of neighboring Massachusetts 
needed not only to win but by a respectable margin 
Republicans Jack Kemp and Pete du Pont needed to beat each other 
Babbitt told a crowd at a Jewish temple in Manchester Sunday 
night New Hampshire this Tuesday has within its grasp the power 
of life and death over my candidacy 
There are people who tell you my candidacy is over Theyre 
the same people who tell you your vote doesnt matter said 
Babbitt who fielded questions for more than an hour and even then 
seemed reluctant to go 
Im willing to stay here till the sunrise whether it comes at 
the usual time or Pat Robertson makes it a little earlier he 
joked 
What kind of finish would it take to allow Babbitt to stay in 
the race Were looking for a reason to hang on Babbitt 
spokesman Mike McCurry said over the weekend 
Babbitts campaign has put up some of its computers for sale 
back home in Phoenix Campaign spokesman Scott Phelps said they 
were surplus now that the Iowa caucuses are finished and did not 
signify an impending campaign shutdown 
Du Pont went into Iowas caucuses saying all he needed to do was 
to beat Kemp to establish himself as the conservatives 
alternative He failed to do that so how could he withstand 
failing to beat Kemp here too 
Im going South in any case du Pont insisted 
In Concord on Monday du Pont dismissed the pundits 
prognostications Oh you remember pundits Theyre the ones who 
told us President Dewey would soon be taking the oath of office 
that President Muskie had this nomination under control that 
Walter Mondale was facing the biggest election victory here four 
years ago he said 
I dont know where all those poitical pundits are today but 
they ran for cover four years ago and theyre likely to run for 
cover tomorrow said du Pont
