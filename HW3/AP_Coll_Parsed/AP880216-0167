BURBANK Calif The Disney Studios decision to tap into the 
adult film market and shed its role as the maker of squeakyclean 
movies is paying off big this week as three Disney movies rank 
among the top five at the box office 
Good Morning Vietnam was the biggest pull at the box office 
over the weekend for a fifth consecutive week while the Disney 
film Shoot to Kill debuted at No 2 and the studios hit 
Three Men and a Baby held on for fourth 
It was Disneys best showing ever 
It isnt a record however Thirteen months ago Paramount was 
the reigning champ with three films at the top of the weekly box 
office list Golden Child Star Trek IV and Crocodile 
Dundee 
The three current Disney films have kept turnstiles spinning 
with a total take so far of 200 million studio spokesman Dick 
Cook said Tuesday adding Its really a matter of having good 
pictures Weve been very lucky 
Cook is quick to point out that periods of glory in show 
business are often brief 
This business runs in cycles Were all just very pleased 
Cook senior vice president of the DisneyTouchstone distribution 
arm Buena Vista Pictures We feel good about whats happening and 
will try to keep it going 
John Krier of Exhibiter Relations Co which charts the weekly 
movie box office performance said the studio shouldnt be so 
modest 
When they take three out of the top four thats pretty darn 
good Krier said 
The studio Cinderella story got its start in 1984 when the 
Disney movie division was floundering and it started Touchstone 
Films Shortly afterward Michael Eisner a Paramount executive 
when that studio enjoyed such hits as Raiders of the Lost Ark 
became as chairman and chief executive officer of Disney 
Touchstones first release was the mermaid comedy Splash A 
steady stream of hits followed including Down and Out in Beverly 
Hills Ruthless People Color of Money and Outrageous 
Fortune 
Disney also has a penchant for releasing old reliable animated 
features This winters reissue of Cinderella added 335 
million to studio coffers and it gave Disney its best winter season 
ever 
Weve been very fortunate since Thanksgiving by having four 
movies perform extremely well Cook said And we have very high 
expectations for our films in spring and summer 
DisneyTouchstone will soon release the thriller DOA with 
Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan then the animated feature The Fox and 
the Hound and Return to Snowy River before heading into its 
summer lineup 
Were certainly at a recordbreaking pace already There are 
some very good pictures coming this summer which should put us 
over for another record year Cook said Last years 42 billion 
box office take industrywide was a record 
Big Business with Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin the Steven 
Spielberg film Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Cocktail with 
Tom Cruise are set for summer release by DisneyTouchstone A 
reissue of Bambi is also in the works
