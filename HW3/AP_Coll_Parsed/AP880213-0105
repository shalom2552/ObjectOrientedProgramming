A department store is offering Japanese Cupids the 
ultimate arrow this Valentines Day a 7700 10ounce heart of 
pure gold engraved with the senders message 
Two of the palmsized hearts have been sold so far one to a 
devoted husband seeking a special gift for his wifes 77th birthday 
and the second to a bank said Hanshin Department Store spokesman 
Toru Imamura 
More costconscious schoolgirls and secretaries choose from a 
wide array of fancy chocolates and novelty gifts 
Besides the old standbys chocolate hearts with long ribbons 
and miniature chocolate whiskey bottles this years items have a 
decidedly domestic flavor Sir Dean chocolate fish come paired 
in a sardine tin with rollback top 
Flip up the lid to another can of chocolates and you find 
chocolate bandages in familiar red white and blue wrappers with 
the warning This chocolate is not medicated sweets 
Baby Choco is softly nestled in a minipackage of disposable 
diapers with a smiling tot on the front 
For the objects of this sweet attention and invention all is 
not a bed of roses Obligatory chocolates given to male bosses and 
colleagues outnumber those of romantic intent spurring receiving 
males to compete in an annual popularity contest 
The possible embarrassment of being giftless at the end of the 
day is enough to keep some men home from work according to a 
Daimaru Department Store survey of 400 men aged 20 to 30 
Less drastic ways of avoiding embarrassment are broad hints 
extra nice behavior or even buying ones own chocolates for 
prominent display A few men console themselves by saying that 
Valentines Day is a foreign holiday with a short postwar history 
Chances are good that generosity on Valentines Day will be 
returned on March 14 called White Day by Japanese candy makers 
who urge men to give their favorite women hard candies
