Housing construction suffered a second 
consecutive monthly decline in January dipping to the weakest pace 
since the end of the last recession the government reported 
Wednesday 
The 19 percent January decline in construction of singlefamily 
homes and apartments reported by the Commerce Department raised 
new concerns among some economists about the possibility of a 
recession this year 
However other analysts pointed to a second government report 
showing that industrial production rose for the fourth consecutive 
month in January The 02 percent rise in industrial output 
followed larger gains of 04 percent in both November and December 
Economists are looking for continued strength in manufacturing 
bolstered by rising export sales to offset expected weakness in 
the consumer sector 
The January decline in housing construction followed an even 
larger 155 percent December plunge and pushed building activity 
down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 138 million units 
the slowest pace since a rate of 130 million units in December 
1982 just as the last recession was ending 
Housing is being watched very closely in the aftermath of the 
record 508point drop in the stock market last October because it 
is often one of the first sectors to weaken at the onset of a new 
recession 
Economists said the two consecutive monthly declines in housing 
construction did not guarantee a recession especially since other 
economic sectors have been showing strength But analysts said 
further weakness in this important industry would be troubling 
If housing continues to weaken it would obviously increase 
the chances of a recession said Lawrence Chimerine head of the 
WEFA Group formerly Wharton Econometrics The rise in exports 
would not be enough to offset a big drop in housing and consumer 
spending A lot will depend on what happens in the next few 
months 
The weakness suggests that people have been scared by the 
stock market crash and are unwilling to take on the commitment of a 
home mortgage said David Wyss an economist with Data Resources 
Inc of Lexington Mass 
Other analysts said that unusually severe January weather had 
contributed to the decline in starts last month and they predicted 
better figures in coming months particularly in view of the fact 
that mortgage rates have been dropping in recent weeks 
Fixedrate 30year mortgages have fallen to a nationwide 
average of 984 percent down almost a full percentage point since 
Jan 1 and the first time they have been in singledigits since 
last April 
We expect housing starts will pick up in February and March 
Interest rates are lower and consumer confidence and employment 
have both strengthened said Warren Lasko executive vice 
president of the Mortgage Bankers Association 
The weakness last month came from a 29 percent decline in 
construction of singlefamily homes which fell to an annual rate 
of 101 million units 
This drop offset a 08 percent increase in construction of 
multifamily housing which edged up to an annual rate of 366000 
units That was still 35 percent below the level of activity in the 
apartment sector a year ago Activity in the apartment sector 
reflects a slump that followed enactment of the new tax law which 
removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real 
estate 
David Seiders chief economist of the National Association of 
Home Builders said that a rate of singlefamily starts above 1 
million still reflected strength in that sector but he said the 
overall industry was being held back by the prolonged slump in 
apartment activity 
He said multifamily construction is likely to fall further 
especially in the South where vacancy rates are high 
In January construction starts fell 171 percent in the South 
to an annual rate of 469000 units Starts were down an even larger 
218 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of 223000 units 
Two other regions showed strength however Starts rose 276 
percent in the Northeast to an annual rate of 291000 units and 
were up 212 percent in the West to a rate of 394000 units 
Building permits considered a good sign of future activity 
fell 82 percent in January to an annual rate of 125 million 
units the lowest level for permits since January 1985 Permits had 
fallen 74 percent in December 
The Federal Reserve Boards report on industrial production 
showed the January strength came from production of nondurable 
goods which rose 04 percent Production of durable goods items 
expected to last three years showed no increase last month as a 
big drop in auto and steel production offset increases in the 
output of light trucks and defense equipment
