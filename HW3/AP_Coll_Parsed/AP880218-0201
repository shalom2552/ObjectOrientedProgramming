Mario Biaggi 70 came to Washington 20 years 
ago as a hero New York City cop rising above the poverty of a 
Harlem tenement to the lofty halls of Congress 
Now he is fighting expulsion from the House 
On Thursday the House ethics committee said it would recommend 
that Biaggi be ousted a rare step He is charged with violating 
the Houses rules for the conduct of a congressman 
The 10term congressman says he wont give up his seat without a 
fight But the development climaxes a yearlong decline for a 
oncerespected lawmaker 
The Bronx Democrats troubles began with his indictments in two 
separate cases 
The first came last March 16 Biaggi was charged with accepting 
paid vacations in exchange for helping to steer government 
contracts toward Coastal Dry Dock and Repair an ailing Brooklyn 
shipyard 
At his conviction last Sept 22 Biaggi scoffed that he had been 
found guilty of tipping But he wept two months later when the 
judge calling the case a Greek tragedy sentenced Biaggi to 2 
years in prison and a 500000 fine 
Biaggi was forced to relinquish his two House subcommittee 
chairmanships 
The second indictment came June 3 when Biaggi was charged with 
bribery and rackeeteering in connection with Wedtech the 
nowinfamous Bronx military contractor Biaggi pleaded innocent and 
faces trial next month 
When a cadre of House Republicans threatened to challenge his 
right to vote He has refrained from voting ever since 
Mario Biaggi was born in a Harlem tenement the oldest of three 
sons of immigrants from Italy He shined shoes and delivered 
laundry to supplement the income of his father a marblesetter 
and his mother a charwoman 
After high school he worked as a foreman in a braid factory 
until when he got a job as a mailman He quit in 1942 to join the 
New York City Police Department 
As a policeman he earned a record 28 bravery citations in 23 
years He received the Police Medal of Honor for Valor after 
killing a gunman who jumped into a car with him and a friend in an 
apparent robbery attempt He was wounded 10 times in the line of 
duty To this day he walks with a cane after being kicked by a 
runaway horse 
In 1960 the dean of the New York Law School Daniel Gutman 
heard Biaggi speak at a dinner and was so impressed that he offered 
Biaggi by then a police detective a full scholarship to study law 
With Gutmans help Biaggi obtained a dispensation from the 
American Bar Association waiving the requirement for a college 
degree Biaggi completed law school in 2 years while on leave from 
his police duties 
He retired from the police department in 1965 as a detective 
lieutenant and was granted a 75 percent disability pension 
In 1966 he helped found a New York City law firm which now 
employs his son Richard who has also been indicted in the Wedtech 
case 
Biaggi won election to Congress in 1968 with 60 percent of the 
vote and has not faced serious political opposition in the past 
decade 
Combining a dedication to community service support for federal 
spending for those in need and outspokenness on such issues as 
SovietJewish emigration and the conflict in Northern Ireland 
Biaggi won the loyalty of the large Irish Italian and Jewish blocs 
in his district 
But in 1973 Biaggi mounted a campaign for New York City mayor 
that nearly destroyed him politically 
During the race Biaggi denied reports that he had taken the 
Fifth Amendment before a grand jury investigation allegations of 
payoffs to congressmen who sponsored certain immigration 
legislation Biaggi sued to get some but not all of the grand 
jury records made public The idea backfired when the judge 
released all the minutes proving that Biaggi had lied and had 
taken the Fifth 
The Internal Revenue Service then launched an investigation and 
Biaggi acknowledged that he had been questioned by another grand 
jury looking into whether a judge involved in a case tied to 
Biaggis law firm had been bribed 
No charges were brought in either case
