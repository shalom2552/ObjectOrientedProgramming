US trade officials have reiterated to Japan 
that they will not extend a fouryear agricultural quota agreement 
beyond its March 31 expiration date 
The agreement includes Japanese quotas on imports of American 
beef and citrus fruit restrictions to which US officials now 
object 
Japanese Agriculture Ministry official Hidero Maki was informed 
of the US position during a visit here last week said Gary 
Holmes a spokesman for the US trade representatives office 
US refusal to extend the fouryear quota agreement carried the 
implied threat of taking Japanese import barriers against US 
citrus and beef before the international panel that resolves 
disputes under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade known as 
GATT US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said that 
possibility would be considered 
The expiring quotas cover fresh beef and fruit The United 
States earlier asked for a GATT ruling on Japanese restrictions on 
the import of 12 categories of processed US foodstuffs Officials 
said during the visit of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita last month 
that Japan would abide by GATT findings 
Imports of foreign agricultural products are a sensitive 
political issue in Japan because of resistance from strong rural 
factions of Takeshitas governing LiberalDemocratic Party 
Although Japan is already the best customer for American farm 
products US officials maintain that the huge US trade deficit 
with Japan and high consumer prices for homegrown foodstuffs 
justify a freer Japanese market for imports
