Vice President George Bush said Wednesday he 
is absolutely convinced the presidential campaign strategy that 
carried him to victory in New Hampshire will work in the South 
We stayed on those issues We dont have to change a single 
thing Bush told campaign staff workers a day after beating Sen 
Bob Dole of Kansas his chief rival for the GOP presidential 
nomination in New Hampshire 
Bush denied he had misstated Doles positions on taxes an 
oilimport fee and arms control in negative ads that flooded New 
Hampshires airwaves 
After he finished behind Dole and Pat Robertson in the Feb 8 
Iowa caucuses Bush revamped his basic stump approach and scrapped 
a heavysecurity campaign style to mix and mingle with voters in 
New Hampshire the first primary state 
Bush also sought in the days before Tuesdays balloting to avoid 
direct clashes with Dole although his commercials charged Dole 
straddled the fence on several issues 
Asked to respond to Doles claim that he had lied about the 
Senate GOP leaders record Bush replied I think I said it 
wasnt true but Ill be glad to 
You all want me to talk about Senator Dole I want to talk 
about the issues Bush said You want to talk about history I 
want to talk about the future 
Im not going to dwell on it he said You see I dont 
want to be drawn into something like that Keep it the campaign 
on a high plane Talk about the issues People in New Hampshire 
like clean campaigns and they endorsed me overwhelmingly 
The system worked You can take them in the chin you can get 
up and you can fight again Bush said So now go on to Super 
Tuesday Were going to fight hard 
Bush commented to reporters as he prepared to leave Thursday on 
the first of several trips into the South the focal point of the 
Super Tuesday competition 
Bush tentatively planned trips to Missouri and Texas on 
Thursday while aides spoke of a possible trip to South Carolina on 
the same day 
Bush hopes to win the March 5 primary in South Carolina giving 
him a boost as he heads into the March 8 round of 16 GOP primaries 
and caucuses with 700 delegates at stake including a dozen 
primaries in the South There will be 2277 delegate votes at the 
GOP national convention with 1139 needed to win the nomination 
Bush said he felt the grassroots campaign approach used in 
New Hampshire would appeal to voters in the South 
But he also said were taking nothing for granted Were going 
to take a positive message a message that was good in New 
Hampshire and is just as good Its just as good as we go 
South Im absolutely convinced of that 
Barbara Pardue a Bush campaign spokeswoman said the vice 
president will continue his newlook campaign strategy of meeting 
and greeting voters A lot more people to people she said
