Republican presidential candidate Pat 
Robertson called Sunday for shifting Social Security to a privately 
based system over a 40year period 
He also accused Rep Jack Kemp without naming him of 
demagoguing on Social Security 
Interviewed on the CBS show Face the Nation the former 
television evangelist said I am absolutely committed to 
preserving the benefits of our elderly citizens I dont want 
to cut Social Security 
But Robertson said that for younger workers between ages 20 and 
40 there isnt going to be any money Social Security is going to 
be broke by the year 2015 
To replace it Robertson said he would allow people to take a 
little bit of their Social Security and put it into an actuarially 
sound interest baring account taxfree like an IRA so that over 
a period of time they can build up gradually so they own their 
retirement 
Asked directly if he planned eventually to do away with the 
current governmentbased system Robertson replied Over 40 
years moving into a private system 
Would that require a reduction of benefits he was asked 
You dont ever reduce benefits said Robertson 
Ive got one of my opponents right now in the Republican Party 
whos demagoguing all four of us on Social Security he said 
Im not going to be demagogue 
Robertson refused to identify the candidate but it was an 
apparent reference to Kemp who has criticized the others in 
advertising and debates on the Social Security issue 
In contrast to Robertson Kemp insists the system is sound 
 
Robertson talked to a congregation at the Faith Christian Center 
in Bedford NH about his life and his campaign both of which he 
said had been guided by Gods messages 
He suggested to the congregation that he might win here 
contrary to the polls that show Vice President George Bush and 
Senate GOP leader Bob Dole fighting for the lead in Tuesdays 
primary 
I want to have the satisfaction of seeing the television 
anchormens faces when they have to report that pat robertson won 
New Hampshire the former television evangelist said 
Church ushers ordered reporters not to take tape recorders or 
pen and paper into the service checking them at the door to enfoce 
the rule 
Later in the day he was asked on CBS News Face the Nation 
if he would finish ahead of Bush as he did in Iowa 
Wouldnt that be a wonderful thing for the country he said 
In a twopage ad in the New Hamsphire section of the Boston 
Globe Robertson compared himself to John F Kennedy who faced 
challenges in 1960 because he was a Roman Catholic 
In 1960 the opposition said this candidate wasnt fit to be 
president Why Because of his religion said the ad under 
Kennedys picture 
In 1988 the opoosition is saying the same thing about this 
man the ad said under Robertsons picture on the facing page 
adding Robertson faces the same kind of prejudice 
Robertson was asked about a recent interview in which he said 
American blacks didnt understand what was happening in South 
Africa 
I think that apartheid is absolutely repugnant said 
Robertson adding that advocates of economic sanctions against 
South Africa are grandstanding all they are doing is playing 
American politics with foreign policy They are grandstanding 
to get votes in this country 
Robertson also said the Reagan administration hadnt gone far 
enough to get the South African government to change its policies 
He didnt try it as successfully as I think it could be 
done said Robertson He Reagan called it constructive 
engagement I think we can go farther than that 
But Robertson did not say what he would do differently
