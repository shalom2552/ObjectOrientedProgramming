Golfer Steve Wells will take a holeinone 
any way he can get it even if it means sharing the golf course 
with a private plane forced to make an emergency landing 
Wells approached the eighth hole of the Mohawk Golf Course on 
Friday shortly after the twoseater plane landed The pilot and his 
passenger walked away uninjured 
Wells and his partner Doug Smith were determined to finish 
their game despite the winged obstacle that remained on the 
382yard par4 hole But police cordoned off the area around the 
damaged plane which put the tee box out of reach 
Wells and Smith improvised making their own tee box on the 
other side of the plane The next thing you know Wells got his 
secondever holeinone 
I hit it about as good as I could Wells said 
Emergency personnel attending to the plane witnessed the feat 
Bruce Gardner the chopper pilot for the police is the one 
who told me it went in Wells said

The folks who live on Stamper Place want 
to stamp out that name and dub their quiet hillside culdesac 
Mystic View Court 
The name Stamper doesnt reflect the feeling of the 
neighborhood said Tom Hoefel a leader of the campaign to change 
the street name We just felt the street needed a pretty name 
The eight homeowners plan to present the issue to the City 
Council on Tuesday 
The street was named after the Rev Larry Stamper a Methodist 
minister who was a councilman in the early 1980s when the area was 
developed 
Aside from not being pretty the street name is sometimes 
confused with nearby Stanford Road or referred to as Thumper Place 
Hoefel said 
Council members dont oppose the change 
I dont believe in naming streets after elected officials 
anyway said Mayor Michael Hastings except maybe somebody 
whos really important like John F Kennedy or Gerald Ford
