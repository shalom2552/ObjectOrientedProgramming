Sen Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee said today that 
while he was concentrating on the South his presidential rivals 
picked up harmful political baggage by taking narrow positions 
while campaigning in other parts of the nation 
They all came out for mandatory controls on agricultural 
products that would be a disaster in the South Gore said on 
CBS This Morning 
Overall Gore says he has no regrets about skipping the Iowa 
caucuses and New Hampshire primary because there was no point in 
spending 1 million on two or three delegates 
Were saving that for the 1400 delegates here in the Super 
Tuesday states Gore said Tuesday night after meeting with a 
group of about 20 Houston businessmen including former Texas Gov 
Mark White 
Gore maintained his focus on Southern states involved in next 
months Super Tuesday primaries while most presidential candidates 
were in New Hampshire awaiting results of that states leadoff 
primary 
We made a decision not to spend 1 million on two or three 
delegates Gore said 
Gore campaigned little in New Hampshire and finished fifth in 
the Democratic race there with about 7 percent of the votes He 
said that was better than he expected but the big test is yet to 
come 
Super Tuesday changes all the rules Gore said I think 
what weve seen were some rather inconclusive results in Iowa and 
the fact that the Iowa momentum did not have much of an impact on 
New Hampshire indicates that Super Tuesday is a completely new ball 
game 
He said the candidates involved in Iowa and New Hampshire are 
bringing to Texas and other Super Tuesday states a set of positions 
on issues that are not in touch with mainstream voters 
Gores campaign already has started television commercials in 
major markets in Texas as well as national advertisements on Cable 
Network News and cabledistributed WTBS in Chicago
