Federal regulators on Thursday ordered an 
immediate suspension of the use of an industrial device which has 
leaked tiny particles of radioactive polonium at plants around the 
nation 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also ordered the 3M Corp to 
recall for inspection all 45000 of the suspect devices ionizing 
air guns used to control static electricity and remove dust from 
product containers 
Robert Bernero deputy director of the NRCs office of nuclear 
materials safety said that of 828 plants inspected so far 
detectable though virtually harmless contamination had been 
found at 118 sites Of those he identified 39 plants where the 
radiation exceeded the reportable limit of 005 microcuries 
This is an incomplete list said Bernero It changes 
daily 
Last week the NRC issued successive recalls of particular 3M 
models used in the food beverage cosmetic and drug industries 
involving about 2500 units The latest order affects all 
industries and applies to all the devices made since they were 
first marketed in 1965 
Echoing earlier reports NRC and Food and Drug Administration 
officials said Wednesday they still have no evidence that the 
faulty devices have posed any health hazard either to workers at 
plants where radioactive contamination was found or to consumers of 
the products made at those facilities 
Bernero said in more than 1000 tests of product samples there 
was only once instance in which radiation was detected involving a 
food supplement made by Ross Laboratories of Altavista Va In that 
case the amount was so low it could have involved naturally 
occuring radiation he said 
But he cited another case involving Moto Photo of North 
Dartmouth Mass where he expressed greater concern about what the 
inspectors dont know rather than what they found That facility 
is in a shopping mall he said and how much of the leaked 
radioactive material might have been tracked out into the mall is 
just unknown 
NRC Chairman Lando Zech said the suspension and broadened recall 
order was necessary in light of the growing list of plants where 
inspectors found the devices had failed leaking microscopic 
ceramic spheres containing polonium 210 which emits a weak form of 
radiation incapable of penetrating the skin but which could prove 
harmful if ingested in sufficient amounts 
FDA Administrator Frank Young said were doing this to ensure 
theres not the rare gun out there thats leaking a lot more than 
anything weve found so far 
Ted L Pickens a 3M spokesman said were certainly going to 
comply with the order In this business you want to react with 
integrity and ensure confidence he said At the same time 
Pickens underscored the findings by federal officials that no 
health hazard appears involved 
Pickens declined to estimate what the recall and inspection 
order would cost the company but said it would have no major 
effect on its overall treasury 
Polonium 210 a naturally occuring decay product of radium 
emits alpha rays too weak to penetrate the skin Though it could 
prove a health threat if inhaled or swallowed in sufficient 
amounts authorities say the protective ceramic covering on the 
material used in the 3M guns should preclude that danger They say 
the particles are too heavy to be inhaled and the leaked material 
in most cases fell harmlessly to the floor Even if ingested the 
shell if intact would pass through the body without harm in two 
to four days they say 
However Young and others have expressed concern that some of 
the shell could be crushed or cracked allowing more radiation to 
escape Young said that if one of the particles were absorbed it 
would yield about 4 rem of radiation By comparison the average 
cigarette smoker absorbs about 6 rem of polonium radiation in a 
year 
Bernero said NRC investigators had found evidence in internal 3M 
records that from 004 percent to 09 percent of the guns 
depending on the model were faulty even though the company 
reported far lower failure rates 
By late last week the government had identified 28 plants were 
contamination was found The facilities just added to that list are
