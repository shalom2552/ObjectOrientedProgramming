The letters phone calls and telegrams come 
from across the nation but the message to police and state Parole 
Board members is almost always the same Thomas Trantino must not 
go free 
Nearly 25 years after Trantino and an accomplice shot Sgt Peter 
Voto and officer Gary Tedesco to death at pointblank range in a 
nightclub here emotions still run high 
From an accountant in nearby Teaneck The courts and the 
parole system should start to recognize the danger which these 
criminals present to society If he killed in cold blood two police 
officers who were in uniform how can those of us who are citizens 
in plain clothes be safe 
From a Connecticut woman I dont want to hear that he is a 
model prisoner who is now a writer a painter They are 
forgetting he has one other glaring accomplishment and that is 
that he committed a coldblooded murder of two human beings 
The prospect of release has sparked a petition drive 
legislative proposals a letterwriting campaign and a candlelight 
rally by more than 1500 people to convince the Parole Board that 
Trantino must remain behind bars 
The case has also revived debate over an old question When has 
a murderer finally paid his debt to society 
Paramus Police Chief Joseph Delaney a leader of the campaign 
against parole said many feel the people who commit the violent 
acts arent getting punishment that fits the crime 
They want to see pure unadulterated punishment he added 
Dont say life in prison for someone and then let him out 15 
20 or 25 years later 
On Aug 26 1963 Trantino and Frank Falco were at the Angel 
Lounge celebrating a robbery When Voto and Tedesco arrived to 
investigate a disturbance Trantino and Falco surprised them 
partially stripped them and shot them 
Falco was killed the next day by police trying to capture him 
Trantino was caught convicted and sentenced to die in the electric 
chair 
The sentence was commuted to life when New Jerseys death 
penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972 In 1980 the full 
Parole Board voted to release Trantino provided that he make 
restitution to the families of his victims 
The decision sparked an outcry and in 1982 the board voted to 
keep Trantino locked up for 10 more years a term that was cut 
almost in half through credits for good behavior and work 
A twomember panel decided last month that he should be paroled 
March 15 but the full board has decided to review the decision 
A Parole Board official citing policy declined to explain the 
decision However under state law Trantino can be paroled only if 
he shows no substantial likelihood of future criminal activity 
and proves he has made progression in rehabilitating himself 
From 1978 to 1982 Trantino was granted regular furloughs from 
prison which ended after the controversy over his parole In 1980 
he married the community college English professor who had edited 
his prison writings into a book 
Trantino 50 is now at the mediumsecurity Riverfront State 
Prison in Camden and declined an interview request In a 1986 
interview he said he had no recollection of the murders and 
believed his freedom was long overdue 
He works in the prison canteen storeroom and participates in a 
program that tries to convince juvenile delinquents in a low 
key way to change their ways said Department of Corrections 
spokesman James Stabile 
Victims rights organizations Delaney and Votos brother 
Andrew now police chief in this small bluecollar community have 
been at the forefront of efforts to block parole 
Recently Delaney and Voto appeared on Morton Downey Jrs 
television talk show The next day about 1000 people called the 
board from across the country to oppose Trantinos release 
Hes a classic con artist Delaney said I have dealt with 
people in my many years as a cop and theres no question in my mind 
that if they release him he will kill again 
The case has struck a chord among family members of crime 
victims 
Most of the letters that come in to me thank me for picking up 
the fight against coddling prisoners Theres too much concern for 
these people Voto said 
Why should a man walk out when he was sentenced to death 
There is rehabilitation and I am for it but not in these types of 
cases not an outright killer a coldblooded killer
