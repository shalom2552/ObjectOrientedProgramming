Economic growth in the 12nation 
European Economic Community will drop below 2 percent this year and 
in 1989 as a result of the stock market crisis last fall a report 
released Thursday said 
But the report by the EEC executive Commission predicted there 
would be no economic recession 
The Commission said that the turmoil on the worlds financial 
markets late last year has increased the uncertainties in the 
world economy and upset earlier economic predictions for a 25 
percent average growth in the Common Market 
EEC economists said this level of growth is too low to bring 
about a reduction in the rate of unemployment which currently 
stands at 115 percent 
Peter Schmidhuber the EEC commissioner for economic affairs 
told a news conference the analysis was based on the assumption the 
US dollar will stay stable at 160 German marks and 125 yen 
through the next two years 
Changes on the financial markets would have profound 
implications for the European economies and could offset any 
national efforts to stimulate growth Schmidhuber said 
The Commission said the slow growth will be caused largely by a 
decline in the growth of domestic demand and sluggish industrial 
investments 
Exports the Commission said will remain flat in 1988 while 
imports will increase by about 7 percent Inflation although up 
against 1987 will remain between 3 percent and 5 percent 
According to the report virtually all EEC countries will 
experience a decline in economic growth compared with 1987 
The report said the EEC should contribute to economic growth of 
its member states by stimulating cooperation in research and 
development investing in large infrastructure products and 
improving the regulatory climate
