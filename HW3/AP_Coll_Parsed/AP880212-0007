Strategists for Jack Kemps presidential 
campaign say George Bushs poor showing in Iowa coupled with 
Kemps toughtalking ads against Bob Dole could put Kemp in the 
running for the Republican nomination 
Before last Mondays Iowa caucuses Kemp had been on a roll in 
New Hampshire using an effective advertising campaign and the 
endorsement of the influential Concord Monitor to help broaden 
support 
But even as his bid to become the conservative alternative to 
Dole and Bush took shape the New York congressman faced the 
possibility of being swept out of the race by former television 
evangelist Pat Robertson 
Using his secondplace finish in Iowa Kemp came in fourth 
Robertson was trying to move Kemp aside and take the mantle of true 
conservative A poll of New Hampshire voters by the Boston Globe 
Thursday night indicated Robertson had drawn even with Kemp among 
potential Republican voters in next Tuesdays primary 
Charles Douglas Kemps New Hampshire campaign manager says the 
Buffalo congressman wants to finish second or third in a cluster 
with Bush and Dole 
We want to be in the 283031 percent range with them 
Douglas said 
He conceded that Kemp cannot afford another fourthplace finish 
saying We need to do well here so we can raise money and 
continue on to the South We need to have at least a close third 
here 
Kemp spent most of the week in New Hampshire making his case at 
coffee klatches before high school students and in speeches to the 
party faithful He is hopeful that his energetic persontoperson 
style and strong conservative message will make him the 
conservative alternative 
John Buckley is Kemps chief campaign strategist 
What you saw tonight Buckley said after Kemp spoke before 
800 Republicans in Nashua earlier this weekwas Kemp making an 
appeal to the heart and soul of the Reagan vote in New Hampshire 
We consider that to be the largest single vote in the Republican 
primary electorate 
Buckley said Bushs thirdplace finish in Iowa presented Kemp 
with a New Hampshire opportunity he never thought he would see 
It was a lucky break that the guy who got severely wounded in 
Iowa was George Bush someone we never thought we could beat in 
the New Hampshire primary 
Kemps strategy had focused on Dole because as Buckley put it 
Dole is extraordinarily vulnerable in New Hampshire because of 
his predilection for raising taxes his four different positions on 
oil import fees and his wanting to cut Social Security in a state 
that has an elderly Republican electorate 
We learned a lesson last month in Iowa Buckley said The 
news media was interested in BushDole DoleBush BushDole 
almost as if they were the only two variables 
The lesson was that by being very specific on issues in a 
tough hardhitting way we could pry the door open to get people 
to take a look at Kemp 
Robertson is now running ads in New Hampshire saying he is the 
best alternative to Bush and Dole and noting that he has already 
beaten Kemp 
But Buckley says Robertson cant repeat his showing in Iowa 
because of an inherently negative message that wont be effective 
in New Hampshire 
For all the voters who may be more comfortable with the gloom 
and doom and dour message of Pat Robertson that were going to 
hell in a handbasket there are many more who will respond to a 
positive conservative message Buckley said 
Im a conservative Kemp told a living room full of 
Republicans in Milford But Ill tell you what folks some 
things need money spent on them Weve got to shelter the homeless 
weve got to feed and clothe and take care of people who cant take 
care of themselves and weve got to have a strong defense
