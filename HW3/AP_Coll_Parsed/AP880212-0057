Senate announced his candidacy for Congress on Friday and 
suggested that his Republican opponents withdraw to avoid a 
divisive 5th District primary 
Gillmor 49 who earlier was considered a likely candidate for 
governor in 1990 decided to enter the race after veteran 
Republican Rep Delbert Latta announced his retirement late last 
month 
Latta 67 who has served the sprawling 12county district in 
northwestern Ohio since 1957 has said that he will support his 
son Robert a 32yearold Bowling Green attorney who also has 
announced for the nomination 
Gillmore told about a dozen supporters here that the best way to 
avoid a bruising primary fight would be for the candidate who has 
the least experience and who is not as well qualified as the other 
candidate to drop out 
I dont expect that to happen he added 
Fremont businessman Rex Damschroder son of former state Rep 
Gene Damschroder also has filed nominating petitions as a 
Republican So far no Democrat has filed petitions in advance of
