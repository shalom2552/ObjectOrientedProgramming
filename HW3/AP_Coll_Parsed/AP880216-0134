Three historians have criticized a new play that 
equates Soviet founder Vladimir I Lenin with his successor 
dictator Josef V Stalin and provides a negative picture of 70 
years of Soviet history 
The criticism of the Mikhail Shatrovs play Onward Onward 
Onward was contained in a halfpage article published Tuesday 
in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda 
The play was published in December and is to be performed this 
spring in Moscow Shatrov a leading writer has used the greater 
artistic freedom of Mikhail S Gorbachevs reforms to produce plays 
on historical subjects that previously could not be touched by 
Soviet artists 
A play published last spring reviewed Lenins decision to pull 
revolutionary Russia out of World War I against the advice of many 
of his supporters 
The new work takes the form of a debate among Bolsheviks and 
their opponents looking back over 70 years of Soviet history at the 
1917 revolution that brought communists to power 
The historians G Gerasimenko O Obichkin and B Popov 
accused Shatrov of using Lenin as a conduit for his own ideas and 
treats the Bolshevik revolution as an accident instead of the 
historical certainty that Soviet theorists claim it was 
They said Shatrovs play equates Stalin and Lenin echoing those 
who claim that the methods of Stalin are identical to those of 
Lenin that Stalin starts his roots from Lenins epoch Thus the 
author unequivocally gives a negative description not of Stalin 
alone but the whole period of the socialist construction of this 
country they said 
Pravda has criticized the play briefly before but the lengthy 
article Monday was the most detailed and serious rejoinder 
In Shatrovs play Stalin is made to answer for the purges in 
which millions died by his former comrades who also became his 
victims But in one scene Lenin says that he is to blame for not 
making sure before his death in 1924 that Stalin never would be 
able to take supreme power 
The plan ends with only Stalin and Lenin on stage Shatrov 
expresses the wish that Stalin would leave the stage but he 
remains
