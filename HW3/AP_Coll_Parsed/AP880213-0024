An Iraqi jet bomber fired a longrange 
cruise missile within eight miles of the destroyer Chandler Friday 
night as the vessel escorted a convoy of four tankers according to 
a media pool report 
The Chandler was not the apparent target or the attack and there 
were no reported injuries 
Iraqi planes occasionally have hit by mistake fishing trawlers 
and last May 17 struck the frigate USS Starke killing 37 American 
sailors 
Iraq said Saturday its warplanes raided a very large maritime 
target off Irans Gulf coast on Friday night In Iraqi military 
terminology a very large maritime target usually means a 
supertanker sailing off Irans coast 
The Pentagon media pool report released in Washington said an 
Iraqi jet bomber on Friday night fired a longrange cruise missile 
within eight miles of the destroyer USS Chandler as it was 
escorting a convoy of four reflagged Kuwaiti tankers to Kuwaits 
oil terminals 
Although the Chandler and its convoy were not the apparent 
targets of the missile attack the destroyer fired two flares from 
its 5inch guns to warn the Iraqi Badger bomber that it was 
approaching too close to the US warship said the pool report 
filed by Norman Kempster of the Los Angeles Times newspaper 
The official Iraqi News Agency quoting a military spokesman 
reported Saturday that Iraqi warplanes struck at a very large 
maritime target off the Iranian coast scoring an accurate and 
effective hit and returned safely to base 
The agency monitored in Cyprus said the attack took place at 
908 pm Friday 108 am EST Friday It gave no other details 
Cmdr Steve Smith captain of the Chandler said he was 
concerned because Iraqi pilots often fire at radar blips without 
making sure what their targets really are 
Having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time I 
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was 
heading toward us Smith said over the ships public address 
system after the incident ended 
Later Smith told a small group of reporters who boarded the 
ship as part of the Pentagons Persian Gulf press pool that the 
Iraqi pilot fired two Sovietmade C601 missiles a 50mile range 
airlaunched version of the Styx which China copied in producing 
its far betterknown Silkworms 
Smith said both missiles passed astern of the Chandler the last 
ship in the convoy but that one of the rockets suddenly changed 
course and passed along the starboard side of the ship before 
veering away to the right 
Seconds later it detonated producing a bright flash on the 
horizon There was no immediate indication whether the missile had 
hit a target or had crashed harmlessly into the sea 
Smith said it was the closest approach of a missile to his ship 
which has been on station in the Persian Gulf since Nov 25 The 
Chandler one of four guided missile destroyers originally produced 
for Iran during the reign of the shah but never delivered is the 
flagship of the Navys tanker escort squadron which includes six 
frigates 
Ensign Brian Josse of Kilua Hawaii the officer of the deck 
when the incident began said later Weve seen Iraqi planes come 
close but never this close 
Quartermaster 2nd Class Dave Markee of Salem Ore who was 
manning a 50caliber machine gun on the starboard side of the ship 
said We believe we saw the missile separate from the jet We 
also saw antiaircraft fire off our stern 
Smith placed his crew on general quarters the Navys 
highest state of alert after the Badger which had earlier passed 
the convoy on a flight south along the gulf from Iraq turned back 
north and headed straight for the Chandler 
Smith said he was prepared to try to shoot down the incoming 
missile if it had appeared to be on a course that would strike any 
ship in the convoy He readied the Standard1 antiaircraft 
missile shoulderfired Stinger missiles and the automaticfiring 
Phalanx Gattling gun 
Smith said he informed the Badger by radio that it was 
approaching a US convoy and ordered it to turn back He said the 
Iraqi pilot who did not speak English very well did not seem to 
understand 
Smith said he then warned the Iraqi that he planned to fire two 
illumination rounds from the ships powerful 5inch gun 
As soon as the flares went off he said the Iraqi jet turned 
sharply away from the ship and fired both of the C601 missiles
