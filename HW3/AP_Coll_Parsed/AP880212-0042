A congressional critic of President Reagans 
Central America policy said Friday the White House may have left a 
loophole in a directive barring government officials from aiding 
private fundraising efforts for the Nicaraguan Contras 
I was disturbed to learn that the White House instructions 
may not apply to all executive branch employees Rep David 
Bonior DMich the chief deputy House whip wrote in a letter to 
Reagan 
White House chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr and national 
security adviser Colin L Powell on Wednesday issued a memorandum 
directing that no administration official should provide 
assistance or encouragement of any kind to such fundraising 
efforts 
But Bonior said the memo was addressed only to White House and 
National Security Council staff members and not to officials of 
the State Department Pentagon and the CIA 
If the White House intentionally excepted the CIA Defense and 
State departments they are laying the groundwork for another 
IranContra scandal Bonior said in a statement 
During last summers congerssional hearings into the IranContra 
arms and money affair activities by White House and State 
Department officials to raise money for the Contras including 
those of Lt Col Oliver L North became a focus of concern over 
the privatization of US foreign policy 
In the memo Baker and Powell said no administration official 
should take a position for or against private support for the 
democratic resistance and that officials should discourage 
discussions of the subject at meetings where they are present 
Contra leaders have said they were actively seeking private 
monetary support 
Meanwhile Reagan declined an invitation from congressional 
leaders to participate in the drafting of a package of strictly 
humanitarian aid to the Contras to take the place of the 36 
million administration package which included military aid killed 
by the House on Feb 4 
House Speaker Jim Wright DTexas and other Democratic leaders 
had written Reagan on Tuesday to ask for his suggestions but 
Reagan wrote back Thursday that he would not offer ideas but only 
react to any proposal Congress might draft 
The outlines of an acceptable package must provide sufficient 
aid to sustain the freedom fighters in order to maintain those 
pressures that have moved the peace process forward Reagan wrote 
The statement seemed a clear indication that the administration 
will insist on aid that would keep the rebels active as a fighting 
force 
Without immediate action by the Congress the freedom fighters 
will become recklessly exposed and may soon have to make 
irreversible decisions about their own future Reagan said in the 
letter Even as I write this letter we have reliable reports of 
new Soviet military shipments to Nicaragua 
Current US aid for the rebels including authority for the CIA 
to make air drops to fighters in the field inside Nicaragua ends 
Feb 29 
In a speech Thursday night to a conservative political group 
Reagan vowed that the curtain hasnt fallen on aid to the 
rebels 
Were not giving up on those who are fighting for their 
freedom and they arent giving up either Reagan said 
Asked Friday what the administration intends to do White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said If we cant reach an agreement 
with the Democrats we will have our own package 
Fitzwater said no decision has been made whether an 
administration package would contain military aid adding First 
of all we want to see what the speaker Wright produces 
Fitzwater said that by the end of February there will be another 
vote in Congress on aid either the Democratic plan or an 
administration package
