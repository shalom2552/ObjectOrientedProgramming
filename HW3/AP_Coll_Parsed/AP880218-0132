The government of Chad appealed for emergency aid 
Thursday to combat an epidemic of sleeping sickness it says has 
affected more than 10000 people in the southern part of the 
landlocked African nation 
The Chad Embassy in Paris said the areas of Randa Dobana 
Belama and Tapol near the headwaters of the Logone River were the 
worst affected 
The health services can no longer cope with the number of 
victims who are being accommodated in tents or temporary 
shelters the embassy said 
Sleeping sickness is caused by a microscopic organism known as a 
trypanosome that enters the bloodstream through the bite of the 
bloodsucking tsetse fly The oftenfatal disease is related to 
encephalitis and is permanently present in many parts of equatorial 
Africa although rarely on an epidemic scale
