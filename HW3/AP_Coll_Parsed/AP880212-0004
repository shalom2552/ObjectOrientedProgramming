Price supports for peanuts grown under 1988 
quotas will be 61527 per ton an increase of 780 from last 
year the Agriculture Department said Friday 
Deputy Secretary Peter C Myers said the increase was required 
by a formula in the law which takes rising production costs into 
consideration 
The annual quota is set at a level equal to the estimated 
quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible uses 
seed and related purposes 
Production of nonquota peanuts which can be grown for peanut 
oil and meal and for export will be supported at 14975 per ton 
unchanged from last year Myers said 
In setting the support for nonquota peanuts officials are 
required to consider certain factors including the demand for oil 
and meal the expected prices for other vegetable oils and meals 
and the foreign demand for peanuts
