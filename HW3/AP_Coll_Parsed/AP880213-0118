Customers at the Waycross Newsstand usually 
discuss politics football and current events over coffee but 
lately talk has focused on charges of discrimination against blacks 
in the mostly white Ware County school system 
Newsstand owner Jack Perry said the complaints stem from 
isolated incidents and are not a sign of serious racial 
problems in the county 
I think we have a fine racial situation said Perry 59 
whose family has lived in this southeast Georgia town of 19500 for 
75 years There are some isolated incidents but we make an 
effort to resolve our differences 
Around the corner from the newsstand is the office of Huey 
Spearman attorney for the Waycross branch of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People 
Spearman disagrees with Perrys assessment He says three recent 
incidents demonstrate a pattern of discrimination that is condoned 
by school officials 
Ten black students say a white school bus driver forced them to 
sit in the back of a bus after they missed school on Martin Luther 
King Day last month 
The bus driver Dale Dixon wrote a letter to school officials 
and passengers saying she seated the black students at the rear to 
facilitate loading and unloading 
In another incident Spearman said school officials failed to 
discipline two white Ware County High School cheerleaders who 
blackened their faces at a pep rally and posed as clumsy football 
players from predominantly black Waycross High 
Black leaders also have charged that until black parents 
complained school officials failed to discipline white students 
who wore Ku Klux Klanstyle hoods at a toga party 
I think were seeing vestiges of the 60s Spearman said 
noting that the county school system is 4 percent black while the 
city school system is 65 percent black 
I think it probably goes back to the days when the schools 
were segregated he said A lot of people moved into the county 
so they would not have to integrate I think the white parents as 
well as the school administration would like to keep it white 
Last week he gave the school board a list of steps the NAACP 
felt were necessary They included the dismissal of the bus driver 
disciplinary action against school officials for improper handling 
of the incidents and a public apology to black students barred from 
county school buses for refusing to sit in the back for a second 
day 
Were going to try hard to do whats right said Donnie 
Griffin chairman of the Ware County Board of Education 
On Friday the board refused to act against the bus driver but 
agreed to erase suspensions from the records of three black girls 
who refused to obey her order 
Griffin a pharmacist said he thought Ware County had been 
blessed with good race relations and he was surprised when the 
controversy surfaced 
For the most part I think we get along very well he said 
We have a great community We want to work to make this community 
even better 
My number one concern is to let everyone know there will be no 
discrimination whether by race or income or handicap Weve got a 
good board and were going to do what it takes to keep it a good 
system 
After black teenagers and their parents testified about the 
three incidents at a board meeting Tuesday night at least two 
black students got menacing phone calls Spearman said 
He said consolidation of the city and county school systems 
should be the ultimate goal but that merger is not likely any time 
soon because many whites still cling to old racist attitudes 
I think the people in the county would fight it vigorously 
said Spearman adding that he believes the Reagan administration 
has contributed to racial problems by failing to take a strong 
stand on civil rights 
Supremacists seem to be on the rise again he said
