Planners of the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library forced to abandon a site at Stanford 
University after widespread protests are running into skepticism 
from some city officials about their proposal to build the library 
near this Southern California city 
The 100acre site donated by the real estate development firm 
of BlakeleySwartz impinges on a greenbelt area that is protected 
from largescale development by a decadeold nonbinding agreement 
among Simi Valley Moorpark and Thousand Oaks 
We do not want the library project used as means for further 
landuse concessions on any property within the greenbelt 
Moorpark officials wrote on Jan 7 to the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors which must approve the project Moorpark Mayor John 
Galloway said similar letters were sent by officials of Thousand 
Oaks and Simi Valley 
Donald E Swartz a partner in the developing firm said in a 
telephone interview from Los Angeles We have seen the letter and 
I think we can live within the scope of that 
But Moorpark City Councilman Clint Harper a mathematics teacher 
at Moorpark College said We are concerned as a council that the 
Reagan library may be used as a lever to get additional land 
development 
However he added that he thinks the 60 million library could 
be consistent with the greenbelt if that is the only anticipated 
use 
Galloway expressed surprise at a report in the Los Angeles Times 
on Sunday that BlakeleySwartz plans to build a 300room hotel and 
conference center on 540 acres adjacent to the library site We 
are going to have real concerns about that the Moorpark mayor 
said 
Swartz said only about 40 acres of the BlakeleySwartz property 
lie within the greenbelt Nevertheless previous efforts to develop 
the property have been rebuffed by local officials who argued such 
development would affect the integrity of the greenbelt agreement 
The strongest concerns have been expressed by Moorpark which 
officials say would be most affected by development of the property 
because of its location 
I think in general people are very supportive of the 
librarysaid Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton One of the 
reasons the Reagans liked the area was that it was so unspoiled so 
development would be contradictory to the presidents wishes To a 
certain extent that will help maintain it as a greenbelt 
The greenbelt covering about 1200 acres embraces an area of 
rolling hills covered with brush beavertail cactus and 
wildflowers The heights command a sweeping view of surrounding 
valleys and on a clear day Californias offshore Channel Islands 
can be seen in the distance 
Although surrounded by more development the site is in itself 
much like the country around the Reagans ranch about 80 miles 
northwest of Simi Valley where the president and first lady Nancy 
Reagan are taking a brief vacation 
Selection of the site climaxed a search which began after the 
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation abandoned the Stanford 
location in the face of opposition from students faculty and 
homeowners Reasons for the opposition ranged from politics to 
traffic 
Mrs Reagan was driven to the new site during a California 
vacation in August and approved it The president gave his approval 
after flying over planners said 
The foundation has not yet filed a plan with Ventura County 
officials for development of the site but has said it hopes to 
start construction in July Local officials say they will be 
concerned if roads and other facilities for the library would 
support additional development 
This is the first time that we have had the prospect of quite 
such a prestigious proposal said Simi Valley City Council member 
Ann Rock This isnt something that comes along every day So Im 
assuming that the Reagan foundation indeed is serious 
Now what I dont know if they have a fairly intense landuse 
plan is whether or not they are going to get the goahead from 
Ventura County That may be discouraging
