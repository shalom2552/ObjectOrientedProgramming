President Reagans 11 trillion electionyear 
budget represents more political accommodation than the seven that 
preceded it It gives Republicans a host of projects to champion 
and Democrats a chance to join them in fleeing town early to 
campaign 
Instead of the deep domestic spending cuts and hefty defense 
increases that marked past Reagan budgets the new spending outline 
appears designed to avoid fruitless controversy with the 
Democraticcontrolled Congress 
In any other year it could have been a budget alternative 
drafted by Democratic leaders a Pentagon spending request that 
doesnt even keep pace with inflation coupled with sharp increases 
for education science environmental cleanup and the battle 
against AIDS 
And while the budget contains a raft of warmed over costcutting 
proposals from previous budgets sale of government loans 
privatization of Amtrak the focus this year is clearly on 
innovative new spending programs 
Much of the fiscal 1989 Reagan budget was already preordained 
courtesy of a twoyear framework agreement struck with Congress 
last fall that was designed to restore market confidence in the 
governments ability to govern in the aftermath of the stock market 
collapse 
That pact set overall limits on defense spending foreign aid 
domestic spending and new taxes removing in a single stoke the 
objects of most past White HouseCongress budget brawls 
Its a rather unique year Treasury Secretary James A Baker 
III conceded on Thursday 
Echoed Budget Director James C Miller III Things are 
different this year We have an agreement Their numbers are our 
numbers an our numbers are their numbers 
Miller also suggested that with party conventions and 
reelection campaigns fast approaching no one is going to want to 
stay in Washington longer than necessary to engage in protracted 
budget battles 
They Congress need to work very fast on this budget and I 
anticipate they will do so 
And while Congress was not expected to swallow the Reagan 
spending proposals whole the new budget was better received on 
Capitol Hill than any recent adminstration offering 
I think its a good faith budget said Senate Budget 
Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles DFla It looks like it meets 
the budget summit agreements Its right at the targets 
Still the administration went one step further than those 
targets in crafting a politically palatable budget document in 
some cases staking out for itself territory that previously had 
been claimed by the Democrats 
For instance after being widely condemned last year for 
proposing a nearly 5 billion cut in education spending the 
administration did a flipflop in the new budget and called for a 
15 billion increase 
Not only does that make political life easier for congressional 
Republicans this year but it also robs Democrats of a potential 
campaign issue 
The president has decided to make education a priority said 
Education Secretary William Bennett We think its good 
politics 
Its pointless to waste time with a budget proposal which 
virtually no one in Congress takes seriously he added 
National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell 
says that the aboutface on eduction shouldnt be a surprise 
This is an election year In election years the Reagan White 
House supports eduction In every other year President Reagan has 
sought deep cuts 
In other dramatic changes the new Reagan budget calls for large 
increases in combating acid rain and in cleaning up the nations 
toxic waste dumps two programs critics had accused the 
administration of neglecting in the past 
Proposals for 13 billion in additional funds for AIDS research 
and correspondingly sharp increases in funds for building more 
federal prisons modernizing the air control system and making the 
space shuttle safer and more reliable are also likely to play well 
in this election year 
In addition the administration has thrown Congress another 
electionyear bone a rosy economic forecast 
The administrations budget assumes declining inflation falling 
interest rates and an economic growth rate of 24 percent this year 
and 35 percent next year somewhat more optimistic than the 
forecasts by private and congressional economists 
The Reagan economic assumptions would result in a lowering of 
the federal deficit from its current 150 billion to 1295 billion 
in fiscal 1989 well below the target in the GrammRudman 
deficitreduction law according to the administration 
By contrast a recent Congressional Budget Office analysis 
suggests that the 1989 deficit could be as high as 176 billion 
even under the budget agreement 
But by accepting the White House budget forecasts and not 
those of its own budget office Congress will have an easier time 
producing the needed savings to meet the GrammRudman target at 
least on paper 
And Congress will do just that under a revision added last 
year when the GrammRudman law was revised 
Even though a deteriorating economy could eventually bring the 
White House and Congress back to the negotiating table to find more 
savings accepting the more optimistic White House projections will 
at least buy time for members of Congress time to pay more 
attention to electionyear politics 
This is the year of the big wink said Rep Dan 
Rostenkowski DIll chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee
