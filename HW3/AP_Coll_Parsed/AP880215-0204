A new superconductor that operates at higher 
temperatures and may be easier to adapt to practical applications 
has been discovered by a research team in Japan scientists said 
Monday 
The superconductor is not merely a refinement of either of the 
two known hightemperature superconductors but an entirely new 
compound that in some respects may exceed the performance of the 
others said a panel of scientists at the annual meeting of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science 
The new material a mixture of bismuth strontium calcium 
copper and oxygen raises the temperature at which 
superconductivity occurs to about 243 degrees below zero 
Fahrenheit a jump of more than 50 degrees above levels attained 
with previous superconductors

If theres anything local school boards 
usually dont like its orders from above But many are finding 
they need strong state leadership to overcome community obstacles 
to teaching children about AIDS 
This is a unique situation said Katherine Fraser 
codirector of the AIDS education project at the National

From gypsy moths in the Shenandoah to wild 
pigs in the Great Smokies to creeping kudzu in the West an 
invasion of exotic animal and plant species is threating the 
nations national parks 
A draft summary of a major justcompleted National Park Service 
assessment of the condition of natural and cultural resources lists 
encroachment by plants and animals not native to park 
environments ahead of any other major issues and threats to 
natural resources 
Sometimes the invasion is part of the ebb and flow of nature as 
with gypsy moths attacking trees in Virginias Shenandoah National 
Park Sometimes it is the end of a complex process kicked off by 
humans as in the replacement of sawgrass with cattail plants in 
the Everglades National Park in Florida as a result of 
fertilizerladen water entering the swamp That changes the whole 
food chain in the park
