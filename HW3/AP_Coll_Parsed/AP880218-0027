Rail labor unions say the Federal Railroad 
Administration is focusing too much attention on drug testing of 
train operators and too little on enforcing regulations covering 
faulty equipment 
The federal railroad administrator countered that the criticism 
was an obvious diversionary tactic to shift attention from the 
druguse issue 
At a news conference Wednesday the Railway Labor Executives 
Association a rail labor umbrella group said the focus on drug 
testing and alleged drug use by rail employees has clouded a much 
deeper problem surrounding rail safety lax ineffective 
enforcement of existing rail safety laws 
James Kennedy the labor groups executive secretary said that 
the federal railroad agencys failure to level fines against 
railroads for defective equipment defective track and its failure 
to enforce other rail safety laws has resulted in an enforcement 
gap in the industry 
Clearly the rail carriers have no incentive to comply with 
safety laws or regulations There is no incentive for 
preventing action by the carriers to avoid hazardous conditions for 
employees and the public said Kennedy 
The issue of drug use by rail employees came to the fore last 
year when 16 people died in a collision near Baltimore between an 
Amtrak passenger train and a string of three Conrail diesel engines 
On Tuesday Conrail engineer Ricky L Gates pleaded guilty to 
manslaughter and admitted he had been smoking marijuana shortly 
before the accident Tests also showed the presence of marijuana in 
a Conrail brakeman 
Last week a federal appeals court in San Francisco declared the 
federal drug testing requirement after railroad accidents 
unconstititutional The ruling hailed by the rail unions is being 
appealed by government 
The labor group said that in 1986 FRA inspectors found 314886 
safety defects at the nations railroads but that only 6497 
resulted in safety violation reports being filed and even fewer 
resulted in civil penalties against the railroads 
Federal railroad administrator John Riley called the statistics 
misleading because many of the safety defects were minor We 
prosecuted more than 99 percent of all violations that our 
inspectors sent to us for prosecution he said 
Riley said that while accidents due to track equipment signals 
or hardware have declined by more than 75 percent in the past 
decade the accidents involving human performance have climbed 
dramatically He said virtually all the fatal accidents last year 
were linked to human performance 
Those numbers speak for themselves continued Riley He 
called the criticsm from rail labor an obvious diversionary 
tactic and an attempt to erect a fig leaf to distract 
attention away from the drug issue and attempts by his agency to 
get enforcement authority over rail workers 
Congress is considering legislation that would allow the FRA to 
take action directly against a railroad employee instead of only 
that persons employer as now is the case 
Kennedy said the unions no longer oppose the FRA getting such 
authority but that in return a train engineer should be able to 
refuse to take a train from a rail yard if he has safety concerns
