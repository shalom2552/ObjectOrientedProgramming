Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said 
Tuesday the economy seems in equilibrium but that he couldnt 
make the same claim for presidential campaign rhetoric 
There is a gross distortion of reality on trade issues in 
the political debate he suggested 
Greenspans comments on the economy appeared to signal that the 
Fed was unlikely to move at least soon on US interest rates 
preferring to take a waitandsee approach 
There had been some speculation that the central bank was on the 
verge of lowering its discount rate the rate it charges for direct 
loans to banks and other financial institutions in an effort to 
stimulate the economy 
The discount rate has been at 6 percent since last September 
The relationships at the moment among all the major financial 
variables seem to be in relative balance Greenspan said in a 
speech to the Bretton Woods Committee a private organization that 
follows issues of international finance 
Greenspans comments on politics made during a 
questionandanswer session appeared to be a dig at the 
gettough trade policies advocated by Democratic presidential 
candidate Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri 
The Fed chairman was asked by a member of the audience former 
Sen Charles Percy RIll what he thought of Gephardts advocacy 
of strong trade legislation during his presidential campaign 
It played well in Iowa where Gephardt finished first in 
last weeks Democratic caucuses and it ought to play well with 
this committee Percy said 
Greenspan a Republican who was chairman of the Council of 
Economic Advisers under President Ford replied The problem I 
have with whats going on in Iowa is that there is a gross 
distortion of reality 
Were Greenspans remarks a direct rebuke to Gephardt or more a 
comment on presidential campaign statements in general 
I dont know what he meant said Joseph Coyne Greenspans 
spokesman 
Percy later told a reporter his question to Greenspan was 
facetious I dont want to see protectionism playing well in 
politics 
Gephardt is the sponsor of Housepassed legislation calling for 
mandatory trade retaliation against Japan and other nations that 
maintain large surpluses with the United States through unfair 
trade practices 
The Reagan administration has vowed a veto if the legislation 
now before a HouseSenate conference committee is enacted with 
such a provision which it considers overly protectionist 
A gettough policy toward trading partners has been a 
central part of Gephardts campaign 
Asked about interest rates Greenspan said evidence of the 
most recent past was in the direction of emerging stability 
in the economy of the United States and other industrial nations 
Economic variables seem to be in equilibrium And I suspect 
they will stay there Greenspan said 
He said the economy appears to be weathering last Octobers 
stock market plunge and that he is encouraged by recent data 
showing a narrowing of the US trade deficit 
However Greenspan said prospects for buoyant economic growth 
throughout the industrial world this year are patently not 
great 
He voiced support meantime for a proposal for a 75 billion 
increase in World Bank funds sought by bank President Barber 
Conable saying it was needed to help developing nations pursue 
sound economic policies 
Conable told the conference the increase was desperately needed 
so the 151nation world lending organization could fight what he 
called an abundance of absolute poverty 
Without this adjustment there is no future for many of these 
countries he said 
And Treasury Secretary James A Baker III told the gathering 
that winning support from Congress for the US share of the 
increase which will cost the nation about 80 million a year 
would not be easy this year 
Were going to be pushing it hard he said 
Baker also said his 3yearold strategy for easing Third World 
debt by encouraging new loans from commercial banks and tying them 
to economic reforms in the debtor nations remains the best appraoch 
Proposals that would wipe out a portion of the existing debt of 
Latin American and other developing countries is a path that 
would lead both debtors and creditors off the cliff Baker 
contended
