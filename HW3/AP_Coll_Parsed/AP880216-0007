The official celebration of the US 
Constitutions 200th birthday was largely ceremonial but 
historians say the true tribute actually came during the 
congressional hearings into the IranContra affair and the Supreme 
Court nomination of Robert Bork 
The Commission on the Bicentennial of the US Constitution the 
official sponsor of the tribute to the 200yearold document got 
some credit from historians for reaching out to the people with 
such things as its pocketsize copies of the Constitution But 
others faulted it for paying too little attention to serious 
scholarship 
Most of the historians interviewed in recent weeks about the 
bicentennial celebration agreed that Americans learned more about 
the Constitution and its workings through watching the IranContra 
hearings on television and reading about the debate on the Bork 
nomination than through any planned activity 
My sense is that the commissions work was not particularly 
substantive said Laurence Tribe a constitutional law professor 
at Harvard University who testified to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee against the Bork nomination Nonetheless what the 
country experienced proved to be extraordinarily profound because 
of the IranContra hearings and the Bork hearings 
You cant help observing how much the public became involved 
in discussions on the meaning of the Constitution the role the 
courts should play the fundamental relationships between the 
executive and legislative branches Tribe said Those topics 
usually are discussed just by lawyers 
G Edward White professor of law and history at the University 
of Virginia agreed that the Bicentennial Commissions efforts 
were largely ceremonial 
The ones that have come to my attention basically are on a 
kind of superficial ceremonial level he said 
In comparison he said the Bork hearings were one of the 
major contributors unconsciously so to the constitutional 
debate 
J Woodford Howard Jr a political science professor at Johns 
Hopkins University recalled that when he went to parties last 
summer and fall all that people wanted to talk about were the Bork 
or IranContra hearings 
This was the Constitution in action Howard said Both 
hearings really drove home the fact that the Constitution is not 
just a document or a fossil but something that is enduring 
Former Chief Justice Warren Burger who gave up his place on the 
court to devote full time to heading the Bicentennial Commission 
said he believes its work did have an impact on Americans 
understanding of the document that guarantees their freedoms 
My guess will be theres a higher awareness a higher 
consciousness not necessarily of the details he said in a 
recent interview in his office If a free people dont look from 
time to time at their liberties and how they got them they take 
the risk of losing them 
Although we succeeded in creating greater awareness that 
doesnt mean detailed knowledge necessarily Burger added 
A coffee table in Burgers office in the Supreme Court building 
was covered with recently published books and pamphlets on the 
Constitution On it too was a cereal box with a short historical 
message copies of placemats from fastfood restaurants with short 
constitutional quizzes and a bicentennial calendar 
Louis Harlan a history professor at the University of Maryland 
and presidentelect of the American Historical Association was one 
of the historians critical of the commissions work 
The parades and fireworks have faded into history he said 
but the commission has failed to give us something that will 
endure and be of use to future generations 
Burger countered that the commissions work will lead to a wider 
audience for scholarly works and noted that other government 
agencies have financed studies on the Constitution 
The commission stated at the start of its work that it wanted to 
teach Americans more about the Constitution It cited a survey that 
found that about half of the public could not identify the purpose 
of the Constitution or explain what the Bill of Rights is 
Burger said no survey of Americans knowledge of the document 
has been taken in the wake of last years tribute which reached a 
zenith last Sept 16 with a party on the Capitol steps in 
Washington and with a ceremony in Philadelphia the next day 
Henry Steele Commager a historian at Amherst College said he 
did not believe it was possible to measure the success of the 
bicentennial activities 
What is the criterion for success for a party he asked 
If you want to know if people learned anything who knows 
Obviously the lessons of Watergate didnt teach Mr Reagan 
anything about the Constitution 
Howard said the mood of the country for the Constitutions 
bicentennial was one of introspection We were worrying about 
whether we have dropped the torch and I think the IranContra 
hearings and Bork hearings really brought that feeling home 
This time we had the Constitution in action Howard added 
Those hearings brought the Constitution to life
