Management Improvements As we all know the federal government 
has a major effect upon our daily lives through the direct delivery 
of services the payment of financial assistance through various 
entitlement programs the collection of taxes and fees and the 
regulation of commercial enterprises As the 21st century 
approaches the federal government must adapt its role in our 
society to meet changing demands arising from changing needs and 
requirements At the turn of the century the US population will 
exceed 268 million with a greater proportion of elderly requiring 
more specialized services The nation will operate at a much faster 
pace as changes in technology and communication link the worlds 
economies trade capital flows and travel as never before 
I have asked the Office of Domestic Affairs and the Office of 
Management and Budget to work with the Presidents Council on 
Management Improvement to conduct an indepth review and recommend 
to me by this August what further adjustments in the federal role 
should be made to prepare for the challenge of government in the 
21st century This summer I will receive their report Government 
of the Future I also intend to complete the Reform 88 
management improvement program I started six years ago to ovwerhaul 
the administrative financial and credit systems in our federal 
government to implement productivity and quality plans in each 
agency and to examine the needs of the federal work force of the 
future I want to leave a legacy of good management of todays 
programs with plans in place to handle tomorrows challenges 
Efforts to improve the management of the federal government must 
be continued We have all heard stories of the horrible waste that 
occurs in the federal government Some of it is obvious like the 
billions of dollars in unneeded projects that were included in the 
thousandpage 1988 spending bill that was dropped on my desk last 
December Some are not obvious like the billion dollars in 
unnecessary interest expense the government paid year after year 
because it lacked a cash management system or the billions of 
dollars lost annually for lack of a credit management process to 
ensure collection of the trillion dollars in loans owed the federal 
government 
In July 1980 I promised the American people I will not 
accept the excuse that the federal government has grown beyond 
the control of any president administration or Congress we are 
going to put an end to the notion that the American taxpayer exists 
to fund the federal government The federal government exists to 
serve the American people I pledge my administration will do 
that I have delivered on that promise 
The first step was taken within months after my inauguration 
when I formed the Presidents Council on Integrity and Efficiency 
composed of the agency inspectors general By the time I leave 
office they will have delivered savings of over 110 billion in 
reduced waste fraud and abuse to the American people 
Then in March 1982 I initiated the worlds largest management 
improvement program with these words With Reform 88 were going 
to streamline and reorganize the processes that control the money 
information personnel and property of the federal bureaucracy I 
told my cabinet at that time that we have six years to change 
what it took twenty or thirty to create and we came to Washington 
to make changes I have followed up on that commitment The 
Presidents Council on Management Improvement has overseen this 
effort and is generating significant results
