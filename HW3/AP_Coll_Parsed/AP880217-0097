NASA says it will choose in April between two 
crew escape systems for the space shuttle in time to install the 
system in the shuttle Discovery for the restart of the manned 
flight program 
Discovery now is scheduled to lift off from the Kennedy Space 
Center on Aug 4 It already is outfitted with an escape hatch that 
can be jettisoned with explosives a change from previous flights 
in which opening the hatch was a laborious timeconsuming effort 
One of the emergency systems would have crew members one at a 
time hook on to small tractor rockets stored in the cabin The 
astronauts would be pulled clear of the spacecraft and would 
parachute to the ocean 
The second system first tested in wind tunnels and now by 
military volunteers in C141 aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base in 
California involves a telescoping pole that would extend down and 
to the rear of the shuttle Astronauts would attach themselves to 
rings on the pole slide clear of the shuttle and then parachute 
The two systems the pole and the rocket both provide the 
capability for us to get away from the wing should we have to jump 
out the side Rick Hauck commander of the fiveman crew on the 
first mission told a Senate hearing Tuesday 
If both those tests turn out to be adequate to do the job I 
think it would be common sense that we would prefer to have the 
system that is the simplest that involves the least amount of 
potential hazard 
The escape system would be useful only on a controlled level 
flight not while the shuttles booster rockets are firing as was 
the case in the Challenger accident in 1986
