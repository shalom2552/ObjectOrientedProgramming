The opening of a sixbed hospice for dying 
AIDS patients has drawn protests from neighbors who say they arent 
afraid of catching the deadly disease but do fear the facility will 
lower property values 
The Shawn Hughes hospice named after the man hospice officials 
say was the first employee of the nearby city of West Hollywood to 
die of AIDS opened Monday in a leased bungalowstyle 
threebedroom home 
Unhappy neighbors say they fear the hospice will bring 
ambulances hospital supply trucks and eventually cars from the 
county coroners office to their quiet residential street 
Its like living next to a hospital said Tom Meleck whose 
home is directly behind the hospice 
But City Councilman Michael Woo said the hospice is not a 
hospital but a place where AIDS patients can die with respect 
and dignity 
Some residents had attempted to keep the facility from opening 
saying it needed a zoning variance to operate in the neighborhood 
But the city attorneys office said that hospices could operate in 
residential zones as long as they were kept to a maximum of six 
beds Woo said 
Alex Hensel who leased the home to Hospice Los AngelesLong 
Beach said he was shocked by his neighbors reaction 
What I found out is that except for the two closest neighbors 
the rest were only concerned about property values After so 
many years here Im going to lose Hensel said 
This isnt a hospital he added Its just a chance for 
people in their last few days to have some warm feelings in their 
hearts 
Hospice Los AngelesLong Beach operates two other hospice 
facilities in Long Beach The newest hospice costs 7000 a month 
to run and operators are hoping for a 200000 county grant to pay 
bills for the rest of the year 
Without it we may have to close this place down said 
Executive Director Ron Wolff 
More than 1200 people in the HollywoodWilshire area were 
diagnosed between 1981 and 1987 as having AIDS said Peter Kerndt 
medical director of the Los Angeles County AIDS Epidemiology 
Department Sixtytwo percent of them have died 
Until now there has been no facility in the city that gives 
the victims who are our neighbors a decent place to die in 
peace Woo said This is long overdue
