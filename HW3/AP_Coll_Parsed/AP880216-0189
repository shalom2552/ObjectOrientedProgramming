With any joss that means luck in Chinese 
therell be something to do next week rather than spend eight hours 
on NBCs mindnumbing miniseries the ignoble Noble House 
based on James Clavells bestselling novel of the same title 
The plot is preposterous the acting spotty the music overdone 
the love scenes embarrassing the special effects fakey And after 
investing eight hours two hours a night Sunday through 
Wednesday on NBC everything is tied up neatly at the end not 
through any clever plot twist but because of an act of God Thanks 
a lot 
Pierce Brosnan late of Remington Steele is a fine actor 
but hes too pretty for Ian Dunross a tough middleaged corporate 
kingpin descended from Scottish pirates Then this suave exotic 
fellow is given as a love interest gawky Deborah Raffin as 
goshdarn American Casey Tcholok a perky corporate raider 
Casey is a tipothehat to feminism The rest of the women in 
the cast are the typical array of hookers mistresses or at best 
secretaries 
Ben Masters manages a believable performance as deceptively 
affable Linc Barlett Caseys boss and honcho of a huge California 
conglomerate But its the villains who get the best of the 
miniseries John RhysDavies as jealous Quillan Gornt longtime 
Noble House rival and Khigh Diegh the most fun of all as Four 
Finger Wu a wily bandit who operates from a junk in Hong Kong 
harbor cuffing his honest son into helping toss hapless henchman 
overboard 
The miniseries was shot in London and on location in exotic Hong 
Kong 
As the miniseries opens Dunross is becoming the new taipan or 
boss of Noble House a huge Hong Kongbased trading company He 
has inherited a financial mess from his predecessor Denholm 
Elliott and must struggle to keep the company from going under 
To that end he entertains a merger offer by a Lincs company 
ParCon Industries 
Enter Linc accompanied by Casey come to Hong Kong to cut a 
deal Talk about your ugly Americans during their brief stay 
banks fail stock markets plunge fires rage buildings collapse 
and murders are most foul Anybody with a lick of sense would 
skedaddle back to the States and chalk it up to poor junket 
planning And a people who place so much emphasis on joss as the 
Chinese must since the word turns up several times a night would 
surely notice that these two havent exactly brought a ray of 
sunshine to their happy port city 
Shortly after Linc and Casey arrive Linc secretly meets with 
Gornt who entices Linc with a possible joint raid on the Noble 
House Casey in the meantime is linking up with Ian Everyone 
remains irritatingly pleasant in between natural disasters 
Also in the meantime bandits play keepaway with a stolen 
broken halfcoin that figures in an inscrutable ancient tradition 
entitling the bearer to a lucrative favor from the Noble House 
Though the plot is supposed to take place over a few days it 
seems like years Time passage is such a problem that at one point 
the characters have to explain in dialogue what has happened when 
and remark how it all seems so long ago 
For viewers it will all seem so long ago too Noble House 
isnt good enough to be good or even bad enough to be good As a 
fourhour junkTV snack maybe But for anyone willing to invest 
eight hours good joss
