EDITORS NOTE Scientists who are just beginning to understand 
the AIDS virus are becoming optimistic that they can find a way to 
thwart it Here is a report on some of the things they have learned 
and the things they have yet to learn

Virologists have learned a lot about their enemy 
the AIDS bug It is devious and elusive stunningly elaborate yet 
selfcontrolled even finicky 
It insinuates itself into the bodys blueprints its genes It 
stays there forever No one can imagine a way to get rid of it 
In its sly way the virus does nothing outwardly bad at first 
For five years 10 years or longer it may burrow deep hiding 
making a grudgingly slow stream of new copies of itself The bodys 
halfhearted attempt to kill it gets nowhere And the viruss 
unsuspecting host feels fine 
But something evil is happening The immune system is eroding 
Then as though responding to some signal the virus springs 
furiously to life It replicates at an astonishing rate And it 
wipes out one brand of blood cell that is essential for health and 
life 
Everyone agrees HIV is an impressive foe 
Genes with names like tat and art rev it up and dampen it down 
With each new discovery of its florid system of checks and 
balances with each new example of the viruss guile the AIDS 
story seems only to get worse 
This is a virus like no other It is designed through evolution 
to elude the bodys own defenses the bloodborne radar and 
missiles of its immune system Worse it is designed to attack that 
system and destroy it In time it does 
It is what it is and we are beginning to understand it 
says Dr William Haseltine of the DanaFarber Cancer Institute in 
Boston 
What we should understand is how bad it is The news is very 
bad and its going to get a lot worse before it gets better 
Yet Haseltine and others who dissect the germs inner machinery 
say that what they see there also gives them reason to be 
optimistic There is plenty to go wrong 
The immediate goal of their work is to figure out how the virus 
works How it latches onto its target How it gets inside How it 
takes over and makes new copies of itself How it kills 
Each step requires a tightly choreographed ballet between the 
viruss own genes and the chemicals it makes an ornate even 
beautiful interplay of molecular thermostats and feedback loops 
that nudge the virus to life fire it up and quiet it down Surely 
the experts reason anything so complicated must be ripe for 
sabotage 
If one knows the critical steps in virus replication then 
strategies to interfere with those steps would be useful says 
Dr Flossie WongStaal of the National Cancer Institute In AIDS 
you constantly need recruitment of new infected cells for the 
immune system to be totally suppressed So any way of blocking new 
infection is important and therefore interfering with the life 
cycle is important 
By Haseltines count the virus makes at least 13 proteins that 
are potential targets for drugs 
The idea he says is that when we learn enough about 
their threedimensional structure we will be able to design drugs 
by synthetic chemistry to fit into their little niches and crannies 
and stop them from working 
Labs headed by Haseltine and WongStaal a colleague of HIV 
codiscoverer Robert Gallo made many of the key early discoveries 
of how HIV works and they have been joined by several other groups 
in picking apart the virus New details pile up quickly 
From this investigation a profile of the enemy emerges 
AIDS stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome but in its 
short history that name has already become outdated AIDS is not 
just a collection of symptoms but a disease with a clear cause a 
microbe called HIV the human immunodeficiency virus 
The virus lives in the bodys fluids blood semen and vaginal 
secretions among others Naked virus floats about freely in these 
liquids but its also carried about inside white blood cells 
Among the most plentiful of these infected cells are monocytes and 
macrophages scavengers that eat bacteria and other bits of useless 
and dangerous matter 
AIDS spreads when the free virus or infected cells pass from one 
person to another Bloodcontaminated hypodermic needles can carry 
them directly into the bloodstream More often however the virus 
is passed during sexual intercourse perhaps when virusladen blood 
cells cross the mucous membranes of the genitals
