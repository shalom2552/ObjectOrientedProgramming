Officials of the Boy Scouts of America have 
voted to allow women in leadership positions including 
scoutmaster ending a policy often challenged in court of providing 
only male leadership a spokesman says 
The Boy Scouts had successfully defended legal challenges over 
its policy for the past 12 years but decided to drop the 
restrictions because the court challenges had become too costly a 
spokesman said Saturday 
David Corti a spokesman in Dallas cited the great cost to 
the organization both in terms of money and in the perception of 
what we are 
We have however won our court cases and probably would 
continue to do so Corti said 
The Boy Scouts National Executive Board voted for the change 
Thursday during a meeting in Washington DC said Barclay Bollas 
national news editor for the Boy Scouts The organization is based 
in Irving 
Our volunteer hierarchy felt boys of this age group should 
have the opportunity to be associated with male role models 
Bollas said of the former policy 
It has cost the organization millions of dollars to defend a 
position that makes common sense said Ron Phillippo executive 
director of the Indianhead Council which includes eight counties 
in eastern Minnesota and four in western Wisconsin 
Experts are saying men must spend more time nurturing and 
providing male role models for youth and Boy Scouting has provided 
this in spades Phillippo said 
Women had been barred from becoming scoutmasters the job of 
leading a Boy Scout troop as well as assistant scoutmasters 
varsity or assistant coaches or leaders of Webelos the program 
for the age group between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts 
But many positions already were open to women including the job 
of leading a Cub Scout troop officials said Of the 11 million 
volunteers within the program nationwide about 500000 are women 
Bollis said 
In fact there are many instances of women serving as trainers 
of scoutmasters he said There was never a question of the 
ability of women It was just that the Boy Scouts felt there ought 
to be male role models for boys 
Other Boy Scouts officials agreed 
I think it is important to provide men an opportunity for 
nurturing Too many institutions do not afford men that 
opportunity We feel we have that role in society said Clarence 
Hammett executive director of the Viking Council which includes 
15 Minnesota counties 
That viewpoint was supported by Judith Erickson a consultant 
for the Viking and Indianhead councils and an associate professor 
at the University of Minnesotas Center for Youth Development and 
Research 
The value in scoutings former policy has been that it 
provided boys with a nurturant male role model she said With 
this change in policy men must be serious about taking on the 
nurturant role in this and other organizations or this will be one 
more instance of women alone developing that type of close 
relationship 
But a 69yearold grandmother who waged a 14year legal battle 
to become a scoutmaster said Saturday that we straightened out a 
wrong 
I think that it is a great thing that happened and I think 
its about time after trying hard for 14 years to get this stupid 
situation straightened out said Catherine Pollard of Milford 
Conn who fought an unsuccessful court battle over the issue 
I do think that this is marvelous because there have been 
women all over the United States in fact all over the world that 
have been doing these things for the Boy Scouts because they could 
not get a male leader but we could not get recognition for the 
things weve done she said 
Mrs Pollard the mother of two boys and two girls and 
grandmother to seven boys and four girls said she has proven that 
a woman can be a successful scoutmaster 
Mrs Pollard who has been involved with the Boy Scouts since 
1950 ran a Milford troop from October 1973 to January 1975 because 
no men volunteered to lead it Her formal application to attain 
scoutmaster status was denied by the Boy Scouts in 1974 and 1976 
As long as your character is good and you havent done 
anything wrong for the position youd like to hold I think we 
should hold those positions Pollard said 
Mrs Pollard said she plans to become scoutmaster for a new 
troop adding I have some irons in the fire I had them before 
the news came out
