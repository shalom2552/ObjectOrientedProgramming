One evening last fall Americas most 
distinguished living playwright stood on a bare stage at the Los 
Angeles Theater Center and read to an audience whose reverence 
overflowed in explosions of laughter sighs and standing ovations 
This soldout promotion for his autobiography Timebends A 
Life Grove Press 2495 demonstrated Arthur Millers enduring 
popularity with American theatergoers who remember Death of a 
Salesman and The Crucible an audience he fears is becomming 
extinct 
Maybe its a minority art at this point he says of his 
great love the theater That doesnt mean its less valuable 
The masses arent always right 
Earlier in the day Miller had reflected on the travails of the 
American theater and his own unhealed wounds from years of critical 
attack He voiced with some reticence his perception that the media 
collaborated in the destruction of his second wife Marilyn Monroe 
And although he is at work on another play he expressed 
hesitation at reentering the often brutal arena of the New York 
theater 
The prospect of battling the theater again is not something I 
look forward to he said 
When I began the theater was the most exciting of media It 
was full of adventure social protest and the new discoveries of 
theater teacher and director Constantin Stanislavsky Some of the 
best actors were involved in theater rather than the movies 
What changed that he surmises was an escalating standard of 
living which pushed ticket prices out of the reach of the average 
person and a new breed of critics who didnt understand 
The Crucible was shrugged off by reviewers when it opened 
in 1953 he said That makes me wonder what else is being 
shrugged off 
A sturdy energetic 72 Miller has found a new fascination in 
book writing His next project may be a novel His 599page 
autobiography offers a rich pastiche of memories from his 
depression era childhood from his painful marriage to the most 
famous movie star in the world and his equally painful 
confrontation with the House UnAmerican Activities Committee 
Some reviewers have questioned the rambling form of 
Timebends which follows no particular chronological order But 
Miller with characteristic confidence sees it as a breakthrough 
I believe the form of this book is new and it fascinates me 
The book is written the way we rememeber not the way movies 
used to show it by flipping calender pages backwards and not as a 
hurdler going over hurdles one after the other he says 
We remember in connected images The mind has no sense of time 
as far as the emotional life is concerned Time is liquid in this 
book like a wave that rolls over on itself Im bending time 
Dredging up memories of his fouryear marriage to Miss Monroe 
appears to have been difficult 
Any of the personal relationships are difficult and painful 
to write about he says But anything that doesnt make the 
author feel pain is probably not worth writing in the first place 
If youre revealing the world youre revealing yourself 
There is a revelation of a consuming love which drew him into 
the unseemly marriage to the actress 
She was a whirling light to me then he writes all 
paradox and enticing mystery street tough one moment then lifted 
by a lyrical and poetic sensitivity that few retain past early 
adolescence 
I was in a swift current there was no stopping or handhold 
she was finally all that was true 
There is some selfcriticism by Miller for failing to save the 
actress from her own demons But more often he blames her demise 
on others the Hollywood hierarchy of directors acting coaches and 
gossip columnists who fed the Monroe myth but denigrated her 
efforts to become a serious actress 
His hardest jibes are at the press which dogged her during their 
marriage and in his opinion conspired to portray her in the most 
unflattering light possible 
I dont blame the press he says The press can 
collaborate in harming somebody but they dont do it 
singlehandedly She was frustrated by the press She wanted to be 
taken more seriously and every time she tried to pick herself up 
off the floor they would then kick her in the face An actor is at 
the mercy of the press 
He is asked whether Miss Monroe a sex symbol in a prefeminist 
era might have fared better today 
Yes I think so he says She was a victim of the 
hypocrisy of the 50s It was hard not to be But the hypocrisy 
continues The tears keep being shed by people who did their best 
to destroy her 
Of his own life so eloquently recounted in Timebends 
Miller says he has few regrets 
Im very fatalistic about it Its not that theres a mystical 
fate but ones character determines ones fate I simply created 
this life of mine the same as your handwriting is yours and cant 
be different We do make our lives and were free to choose in 
one way or another
